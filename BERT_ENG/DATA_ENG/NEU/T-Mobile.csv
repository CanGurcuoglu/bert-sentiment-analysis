"Overall, I don't have a problem with T-Mobile. I've been with them since their beginnings. What I have a problem with is to be insulted and lectured to by the AI. I needed to change a setting on the phone, (Which I finally figured out on my own. Not going to write what the technical support said to correct it). Thank God my Do Not Disturb turned on as she was trying to tell me some convoluted thing to do. My problem was I had changed the settings from Google to Samsung for the keyboardand voice texting. But could't change it back. Hence both were fighting for dominance. And I was stuck with repeat text messages. At least this phone wasn't sending them out like the s23 was. This time calling T-Mobile was a complete waste of my time. However, in all the years I have had them.I really can't complain. But get rid of The person who programmed the AI!!!",1
I’ve used T-Mobile military Business for twenty-five years. A few problems. One was never fixed. Our son went overseas. Now when people call my number a message says “Put these numbers into your phone to complete the call” I gave up on the fix WHAT HAS MADE ME ANGERY IS GIANT DOWN PAYMENTS. I have perfect credit. I’m disappointed in T-Mobile.,1
"Once we got our month T Mobile SIM installed it worked well, no problem there.  However, the SIM was sold as a month of use in the USA, when in fact service was terminated before midday on the 30th day, so effectively we only got 29 days use.  This was even more annoying as it meant we had no means of communicating on our day of departure.  Since when was a month only 29 days???",1
I wish I could give T-mobile a better score because they were great until I had to deal with their affiliate company Assurant for a broken phone. Assurant totally fell through in replacing my phone. So I went through 3 calls to T-mobile to get help. They did a lot of lip service how I was a valued customer but did NOT help me in any way other than offering a full price phone replacement.,1
If you are not connected to wifi it is terrible. Unlimited internet lol if it even loads.,1
"I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile around 8 years ago because Verizon customer service was horrid.I've never had a problem with them until recently, they refused our jump status which we pay for because we didn't want to pay more for the new plan. So therefore what I'm paying for is bull!!!!Then I got the Internet tower and they stated that price would not go up from $40 month.  I recently saw my bill and Internet was $45 a month.🤬",1
"We started with T-Mobile in 2018. Back then the service was amazing. Customer service was prompt and the CEO back then seemed right on top of things. However, after the CEO moved on, it seems like things have kind of fallen a bit… Customer service became hit or miss, home internet was offered to me, but then rescinded without me even being contacted, and the local stores in my area became not as competent as before. We recently moved service to Verizon.",1
"Experience the unbeatable power of T-Mobile! With a wide range of services, T-Mobile will help you stay connected, no matter where you are. From reliable 4G LTE data to unlimited talk and text, T-Mobile is the perfect choice for all your wireless needs. So don't wait - take advantage of T-Mobile, today!",1
"This is difficult, because I had a wonderful experience with the Bellingham WA call center. But I started in the Shoreline Midvale and Aurora physical store and have never been treated more rudely. So I would review the call center in WA 5+ and the physical store 0.  I am not sure why the sales rep was so rude but she needs to find a new job is she is that unhappy. Also she flat out lied when she said that I had to call customer service to resolve my problem. As the call center apologized and said they could have easily resolved your issue in the store.",1
"i've been using T-Mobile for past few month, it is the best network so far for me, am satisfied with the fast internet services lately. They have shown great empathy towards customer problems, strongly recommend it.",1
"I went into the T Mobile store in Fayetteville, Ga. today to get assistance with transferring information in my Samsung phone. I am 71 years old and not as savvy as the young people with computers but I do fairly well with my phone. the tech on duty did not listen to me when I told her my problem and I was told that older people "" need to start learning how to do this stuff themselves"" in a rude tone of voice. I told her sorry that I didn't want to bother her any longer. I drove to Riverdale ,Ga to the T Mobile store  where I was helped and treated with professionalism and courtesy. The later experience made up somewhat for the first experience but will not be returning to the Fayetteville location again",1
"Up until the past couple months we were always extremely pleased with T-Mobile, especially the Internet service.  Over the past couple months since we moved to SW Florida we have had several notifications about tower maintenance to ""ensure a great network experience"".  I beg to differ.  Last week there was a tower maintenance issue that completely disrupted and slowed our Internet service from 450 down to 12.  While their Internet customer service reps were very friendly, they tried to tell us it was our 5G device while all the while it was due to their tower issues.  We just got another notice about tower maintenance today.  All that seems to do is interrupt and slow down our service for days until it stabilizes. This is not acceptable when one works from home.",1
"I'm upset.  I'm a veteran of 8 + years. The veterans administration had me free phone service through t-mobile for a long time. The funding for the free phones stopped, t-mobile let me keep my number, but now I have to pay 60 a month! No problem with that,  but now I have to go prove I'm a veteran. Just goes to show, that T-MOBILE never really cared enough about veterans in the beginning! They don't even know we been in their system!",1
First I'd like to say their customer service is good.  We dealt with Drew in the Walnut Street store in Philadelphia.  He was great.  As far as the switching over from another carrier...READ THE FINE PRINT.  They say if you switch you get a free IPhone 14.  Not true if you want a Pro or better.  ASK QUESTIONS!!!,1
"I have had T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for 11 months. It was traumatic to install and took many hours. The Gateway is a small corded box controlled by a mobile based app, just plug the box in and turn on. My T-Mobile tower is 1/2 mile from my house, my Gateway sits next to a window about 10-30 feet from my devices, a MacAir book, 3 ipads, 2 iphones, an Epson printer USB connected to the Air book, and an LG smart tv. The advertised download speed is true, between 100-400 bps.The app, once the complicated passwords are renamed, is easy to use.My connection shows 'Excellent' about 95% of the time. I assume that means the connection between the box and the tower. The connection between the devices and the gateway are sporadic. Two of the ipads, uncorded, disconnect at least five times during the day, the worst is the lost connection to the 'Air Printer' several times a week. What is strange the one ipad and the tv are 100% corded and never lose connection. I suspect sharing the tower with the T-Mobile cellphone users may be part of the problem. My few calls to customer service were helpful and quick. I have paperless auto pay and is no problem. I have not disconnected the gateway and moved it to another location in the town, so can't say how that would work out. I recommend the service, which has limited locations, for the convenience, price, and listed speed, Maybe you would not experience the disconnect problems I have, a nuisance, but easily fixed by 'forgetting the network' and reconnecting with the password, There is no contract so a tryout will be easy to give up if not satisfied.",1
"I was with sprint and I didn’t have a choice of changing to T-Mobile when I was with Sprint they had a contract and I wanted to pay off my phone but by the time in the end of the contract they told me I couldn’t so I had at least my phone so many years I paid on the phone and they would not let me buy it now with T-Mobile They say they don’t have a so-called contract but if I pay off my phone early which I should be able to you still have to pay till the end of your billing so I can pay off my phone but I still have to pay for 18 more months that’s ridiculous. I would never go with T-mobile again ever if you’re smart by your phone outright, and do not get a contract. Do not sign anything with T-Mobile or Sprint  these totally take advantage of a person that doesn’t know they’re being taken advantage of !",1
"It's been great until lately.  I have an issue with the trade-in value that I got for a phone that I had that worked perfectly fine.  I just wanted to upgrade.The tech sent me back an email informing me that I would only get a 10% discount because of a display issue.  That meant that there was something wrong with the display on the phone.  There was nothing wrong with the display when I sent it.  I wanted to SEE what the problem was. When I called the agent, I was told that they didn't have that information.  That agent said that he understood my situation and could give me a 20% discount because I was such a good customer and had been and was a long-time customer.  The next billing period the discount that the agent promised was there.  Then the month after, it was gone, so I again called and that agent again understood the issue and he promised the 20%discount.  Again the next billing period the discount was there but only for a month.    The following month the discount was gone completely.  I called this time and the agent was completely rude but he did talk to the supervisor and said that they could put on the original discount but then said smugly, you should feel blessed that they put on the discount because usually when the tech said something is wrong, they don't give any discounts.  I said, Wow,REALLY?!  He also said that the 2 prior agents do not have permission in giving the 20% discount. So that was 2 separate agents that applied the discounts but shouldn't have?   I just wanted them to show me proof of the display issue.  That maybe the Tech made a mistake.    So I am really thinking about changing  Carriers because this was a total headache.",1
"As far as the cell service and internet service, they are good.  It's the supports they have in place that fail at both the stores and tech support.  When I added lines, the tech at the store told me one thing and it ended up being the opposite causing me money, stress, anxiety and frustration.  Eventually it was corrected, but geez.  He also never told me about the requirement to register my liquid screen for my phone for the warranty coverage.  He is no longer at that store.  I decided to get T-Mobile Inet, tried to order the service online, and had issues, so I went to the store and the tech told me that he could do it for me.  He cancelled my order and setup up my equipment.  However, he did not tell me by doing this my $200 rebate went to $100, which I just found out while returning to the store.  He instructed me to call tech support for any additional items needed for the Inet.  Well, the mesh needed it. I was also told that the 2.4g and 5g could be separated and certain devices will not work on the 5g.  I was on the phone with tech support and after 2+ hours, they could not figure out how to do that.  Then I went in for a warranty and was texted and emailed the product was there and they could not find it.  The tech handed it to me and said set it up like before.  I told him I did not set it up the store did.  There were issues with his capability to do that.  Then when I asked both of them about the internet and the 2.4g vs 5 it was deer with the headlights look and neither of them could help, nor did they offer to.  So back to the drawing board and figuring it out.  They are car salesmen and will tell you what they need to for the order and that is very disappointing.  At least with Spectrum they come to you and set things up.  Overpriced Inet, but they help.  I am frustrated as I can link all of my home devices to this Inet because of this issue which in turn impacts my home security.  The product the provide is worthless if the customers can't use it and/or don't understand how.  Then lets not forget the issue with the phone service (land line) if you want it.  That is a 3rd party and not explained until after you get the product.  Again, it's the techs who are not properly trained to understand and help the customer understand.  BTW, the store was dead and still no offer to help.  The playlist provided by corporate was vulgar.  I'm done now.  Get it together T-Mobile.",1
I just signed up with them a wk ago they will rush you into signing up that they for get to fully explain how much data the home internet has mines is about to run out soon but no one took out the time to explain how much was available it’s working good to be in a rural area but watch all the nice talking they’ll overlook some things in the process,1
"Mr. Carmelo thank you for your time and excellent service to help us, to solve our problem. Your Legend to help our frustration regarding the charges that we even doesn't know. We are so glad and very thankful that you can able to end up this ghost in our account. I can give 5 stars to this people that help us from the beggining until now Carmelo, John, Trey. They are smart people that we can assured help from customer service representative.",1
"Their people on chat had a number next to their names.  For that, I will give them 3 stars.  More companies should do this.",1
Being a 5g subscriber  I have been only on LTE service for 5 straight days in my area in Northern Virginia. Normally the service s satisfactory. The issue I have that  Prompts me to only give 3 stars to T-Mobile is the fact that I had to call customer service to find that they are making an upgrade to the 5G tower in my area. They never reached out to me to explain that I would be out of 5G coverage and apparently there is no time frame that I can be given on when my 5G service will be restored .  So now I am supposed to just continue paying for service that I don't know when I will be receiving? This is poor customer relations because they could have easily sent a text message to customers in this area that will be affected explaining that we will not have 5G service for a specified amount of time.,1
"Short and sweet: T Mobile coverage in my area is not the greatest. For beinging on the internet, talking on the phone and texting. I have had to hit send up to 5 times sometimes to get a text to go through.Customer service is awesome!!! Best I've ever experienced with any provider. So there it is.",1
I tried T-Mobile years ago and service was horrible.. now in 2022 it’s actually Improved quite a bit but the reason for my review is customer service.. with such a big company expanding more and more fhe customer service is horrible.. no when you call you always get someone who speaks broken English in another country and in the background it sounds like there are hundreds speaking another language.. to me this is not professional at all.. T-Mobile claims top tier service and top tier customer service.. hate to say the customer service is way below sub par.. it’s horrible,1
"Went to T -Mobile. Several displays stating I phone on us. Talked to lady and got the 55.00 a month package. First statement, 103 dollars. I go back and I didn’t say I was trading in my old phone. Well!!!! They didn’t say to get the I phone 13 on them I had to say I was trading in my old phone. After 4 , 30 mile round trips I did get the 55.00 dollar a month deal but I have to pay 33 dollars a month for 24 months.",1
"I purchased mobile hotspot with them.  Even though I canceled it they kept charging me.  I finally had to get the credit card company to investigate and they reversed the charges.  I had the email confirmation from when I canceled.  The service itself wasn't terrible, but there was times when the coverage wasn't nearly what they claim on their maps.  The 5G service is fast though so if you need that and they have coverage you won't be disappointed.",1
Service was excellent until they screwed me out of my trade in money. Was promised $300 trade in. They retroactively removed the trade in and never notified me. I just noticed the higher bill. Then they told me it was too late to do anything about it and kept my phone and money. Then two different CS told me they'd change my plan to a lower bill and didn't. Last straw... Vax mandates and firing employees. I'm out.,1
The 3stars go to our rep! He was fantastic! T mobile deserves a big zero! We have the phones for 2 days. Most calls dropped or no service. We are in a large city. We had Verizon for over 12+ years. Never dropped calls or no bars even outside standing in our street! Headed back to T mobile to return the phones and then to Verizon to get reliable phone service.,1
Canceled service 7 months ago. Called today t Mobil keeps charging me. Spoke with Jonathan who left me on hold for over 1 hour. He did tell me account was cancelled. I ask why t Mobil keeps billing me. He could not answer. Save yourself the trouble use any other providerHorrible customer service and any service.Should be ashamed how dishonest they are,1
"I dud call customer service tonight , and expend time to ask about new promotions, it was fine , but the service representative was no nice , because I did ask different questions and he star to getting nasty and unpolite and I was trying to purchase two phones on line and suddenly, he hang up the phone conversation on me , that is the problem with some representatives from tmobil overseas , they are not patience and they don't care abd this give a bad name to your company !!, they should hire better people and more educated ones and more professionals !!!!!!",1
"The service is fine, customer service is fine too. What pisses me off is they say when you order a new phone it will he 2 days maybe 3 days until you get it. I ordered it Monday and it literally just shipped today so wi won't be getting it until this Monday.. thats my only issue, if you state something your going to do, I expect you to do what you said...even more so with a company such as T-Mobile.",1
"Thanks for all the reviews. I was just about to accept their promotional offer of paying off my current phones to my provider, ATT. My wife suggested I look at the reviews first. Glad I did. I will not be switching over to T-Mobile based on all these negative reviews. They were very helpful.",1
I have been a t mobile customer for 7 years. I am happy with customer service and there prices. What I am not happy with is that someone was able to add a iphone to my account on 3/6/2021. And again on 5/4/2021 because the person that the store did not follow the added instruction for my account because i am a victim of identity theft. I am supposed to be the only one who can make changes to my account. As much as i like them i will be leaving them if this happens one more time.,1
The 4G service has really declined over the last few months after they focused more on setting up 5G in my area. I have an old iphone 7 and don't have 5G. My 4G LTE data is sooooo sloooooooow it's rediculous. Now I have to get a new $1000 phone in order to get decent data.,1
"T-mobile is an upgrade from the pre-paids like boost and straight-talk (I've used both).  Phone coverage is much improved.  But the data rates are lacking, even off-peak.  If you want to game you will need to do it when most people are at work or asleep in your area, otherwise you are getting powned by the zitty kid with the strong wifi connect.",1
"I read reviews about their dishonest warehouse & YES I CAN RELATE. I gave them a 3 star because they at least fixed my monthly rate for 2 months now after i called this in 8 months ago. Soo for 8 times, ive had to call, explain MY SITUATION, & stay on the phone for about 20 minutes OR MORE with DIFFERENT ASSOCIATES before the last one literally had managed it for 2 months now. BUT, the previous phone is STILL not off my line. They should send it back to me since i paid it for so many months before they adjusted the prices.",1
Wednesday I was here 3:00 and half hours had to come back today and they still got me and other people waiting.Here I am again. Just don’t make no since. When are these companies going to ever learn. Pay your employees more money and stop trying to work the ones you have to death. SMH. 🙁,1
"I had to send back the tablet that wasn’t right for me and since I paid initial payment for this iPad I need my money back.Looks like the Refund process in TMobile is terrible. I am waiting already 2 months...So I was charged in 1 min, but refund will take 2 month or more, still not sure when I will get it back . 😐 So my advice Think Twice if you’re not sure you Really want  that or other type device or you will wait to get your money back  money long time and spend time on calls.Definitely needs improvement.",1
"I refer a friend to get $50. But when I claimed the $50 they refused to give it to me. Another incident, I went to a T-Mobile store to make a payment. That young lady, one of the staff took a picture of my account with her personal cell phone. I asked her why she said because this computer is not working and I wanted to go to the other computer. I asked why did you take a picture of my account using your personal cell phone. She answered me in a non professional way. I put in a complaint with T-Mobile but they never got back to me and the staff is still working in the same location.",1
"I am annoyed with T-Mobile right now, they recently expanded international plans so it's great when you travel buy they got rid of a lot of calling discounts for different countries... I wound up with $60 of overages on my last bill because they failed to inform me. they did credit it but I'm still annoyed cause now I need to use Skype to call my family back home.",1
"Just started w/T-Mobile about 3/ 4 month. Been w/ US cellular for years, always having to watch for extra charges / changes on monthly bill, never the same.  T-Mobile- great friendly customer service, wish we could get better phone service, may have to change to another carrier due to running two businesses from cell phones.  Need more / better service from phones, I hope they can pull it together, I love my new phone, seems better set up.  PLEASE pass this info to the top to get some changes made fast....highly depend on phone service!  Thank you",1
I will never go into this store again.  They had little knowledge of the plan I wanted and one lady said it did not exist. They were the most belligerent employees I have ever had to deal with. I wanted to discuss a problem with the manager and he would not come out of his back room. Definitely not an asset to T-Mobile.  I went to the T-Mobile store in Deland and what a difference. Two ladies were extremely knowledgeable of the plan and very helpful in explaining what I had to do.  They spent a great deal of time setting up my WIFI Hotspot device in which the other store said it was not compatible with their system.  I cannot say enough about how well I was treated.  There names are Olivia and Stephanie.  Don't waste your time at the Saxon store and go to the Deland store,1
"I have been a loyal customer for 15 years. The service is decent, but, support sucks. you finally got 1 thing right. Praises for the ScamShield feature. I had been getting daily scam/robocalls. I am no longer getting them. It's about time you got something right.",1
"T Mobile needs to re-design the web site because it is difficult to use. I use the same password each time and it never works. Even after I get it to work, the system is not easy to navigate. The customer service is not any better either. The bill pay will take you all the way through with a response for the many questions and near the end, it will say...I will get you a representative but do not provide the representative. Other companies, you can pay by phone without the hassle.  T-mobile, I do not want to spend 30 minutes to one hour trying to pay a bill. Please make it simple.",1
"We've been with TMO for 4years. It's a matter of which poison do you take? All mobile carriers are suspect. However, we have 13 lines with TMO. Has been peachy, rosy and awesome? Heck NO. But we learn to work with our account manager and make the best of the situation.",1
Big shout out to T Mobiles Facebook agents. I left Verizon for enticement of cheaper more straight forward plans and coverage where I needed it with 5G. Well while prices were straight forward promised coverage was less then friendly and not there at all. I use my phone for work and personal including school and hotspot so it's not optional not to have service where needed. I reached out through the app via chat and to the local store and got the run around. The Facebook team resolved my issue which ended in a no charge to me end of my service enabling me to go back to my previous carrier. The Facebook team resolved my issue and made sure I was satisfied and are still checking in. The rest of the team should take lessons from them.,1
I was trying to get my phone unlocked and switch to Verizon. I got the phone from my boyfriends dad and there wound up being some kind of a charge issue on the account. I wound up calling and talking to two or three of the customer service people and went into the store even to try to figure out what was going on. It wasn't until I went into the store to get it unlocked that we discovered the charge. All the worker did was temporarily unlock it. So when I got back home I called again and talked to Matt in the KC store. He was so helpful and very patient. He's the best one I talked to.,1
"I signed up with T-Mobile 5 years ago and we thought they were the best company to work with as their customer service was the best I had ever experienced and i am 70 yrs old. Seems that since they were joined to Sprint the internet service has gotten more unreliable and the excellent level of T-Mobile customer service no longer exists.  You can't contact a phone rep unless you decide to give up an hour or two just on hold.  Don't even think of sending them an e-mail now, you just get an error message. I had always heard people in my area complain about Sprint and it seems as if Sprint's effect on T-Mobile has been a disaster for T-Mobile customers.",1
"UPDATE  THEY RESET MY DATA AND  DATA IS RUNINING AT 28MPS  NOW  > sold me unlimited hot spot plan  that moved at 2 MPS at times and others was 1MPS ! when i said cancel it they upped my bill $10 just to have same service  had  before and down graded data streaming i had grandfathered in,  my wifes phone only use 2 gigs a month  but her data is 3MPS most times some much for unlimited,They are a joke Unlimited is oversold it going back to ATT enterprise Hot spot and using phone App . Customer service LOL calll 3 times trying to unlock phones  and they cant get it done  will just root em  as its easier than dealing with these morons",1
I've been a customer for over twenty years. My complaint is they are constantly shoving the homosexual lifestyle down our throat in all there ads. While hoping to gain customers .,1
Our family was with T- Mobile for 4 years and things were fine and customer service reps were nice but when I tried to cancel our service I did not understand that I had some lines on the account that were open that were not in use that I was still being charged for. Each month I continued to be charged and would call and try to cancel but I kept being charged. I ended up having to pay an extra $369. I tried disputing the charge but T- Mobile sent me to a law firm. You think after four years of perfect payments they would have given the customer the benefit of the doubt. I just wanted to cancel. I will not be recommending T- Mobile to anyone I know which is unfortunate because I have six children and lots of siblings and friends.,1
Yeah. There's only a 14 day grace period if you don't want their service anymore. Thats with all cellphone services. Don't by anybody's word. I usually read the bylaws. Just FYI,1
"i would give 5 stars if danielle was the only one to help me - and 2 others whom i recommended to TMobile - move over to tmobile. i went to the 30 ave astoria tmobile and got speedy service. so i naturally recommended my brother who took out 2 lines also. however we discovered that Adam messed up IMEIs and colors so returning 2 lines had major issues. were it not for danielle we'd be leaving more reviews. bad reviews. it is not recommended to go to this tmobile unless you have danielle as the take charge person. the one thing you need is honesty, not luring customers in and misleading them. we felt adam did this. with free Netflix plus the mega mix up which tmobile took many days to sort out and only at Danielle's vouching for us.",1
"3 stars for offering service. Consumers listen...After i read online that tmobile got fined for hiding dropped calls. I had my own discovery. I called customer service several times because sometimes i had 3-4 bars of LTE service, yet no to limited data. It wasn't until my last call when a rep let it slip that there was no LTE towers within 15 miles of where i was. I believe they rig there phones with false representation and I left Tmobile. Also right off the bat i was offered a deal; buy a V20 get a free phone and with multiple lines we got a LG pad. After months i realized i was still charged. At 1st i called & a rep told me it would come off, then months later i called and rep said the deal ended. After pushing a lot, finally they upheld the deal.",1
"Been with them for 23 years. In all that time they have been great, horrible, problem solvers and lately, they are a mess! Im not gong to rehash my latest issues that have been finally resolved. This complaint is about the app. Two things. First, No way to email them. The one issue that really kills me is if I call customer service and there is a wait time, 75% of the time I will be offered a call back option. But try to find that on the web site or the app. I just spent from 6:38pm until 7:22pm trying to find where that feature is? I have been told many times to go to the app and schedule that call back. Yeah OK where? I am so angry right now. The only good thing is I don't have to be asked by the customer service representative if I would tell my friends and family how great they are and recommend them? It is better not to say what my response has been to that statement.",1
"I do not understand how I can pay for unlimited data and still get overage notices. I just got another one this morning. I do not understand why the billing practices are this way. Last time this happened I got a ""oh wow you were not on the right plan"" when I thought I was. So I changed everything and spent yet more money with them. Now here we are again almost a few years later with them telling me I'm going to run out of data.I really don't have anything more to say about them, the billing practices really do have a scummy vibe to them.Both my wife and I are starting to feel taken advantage of and it's getting to the point where we are starting to look at alternatives.T-Mob, you can do better then this. If $$$ is going to get the customer unlimited then just tell them that. If unlimited doesn't really exist on your network then stop calling it that.  This isn't right.",1
"UPDATE : T-Mobile has fixed the problem in a timely manner. Not sure if this posting had anything to do with the fix, but it has been resolved.I am no longer a ""fan"". I recently had to cancel my postpaid account due to money issues. My bill was finalized on the 18th but received a call from a collection agency today the 21st before I even received my final bill. It has already shown up on my credit report and dropped my score by 67 points. What did T-Mobile customer service say? We have no idea how your information was already sent out to a collection agency. I was planning on coming back as a prepaid account since I spend most of my data on wifi, but that has changed. Goodbye T-Mobile. And corporate was no help either. Same excuse. A loyal 20 year customer and that is what I get for doing my best to defend them... Horrible.",1
"T-mobile has a lot of fun perks that make it seem like your getting something really fun and exciting... but their network is quite terrible! No service at all in rural areas, on back roads, even in some suburban areas. We have an entire neighborhood paying for service but not getting any mobile internet or having it very limited or super slow for over a week now. I had to buy an internet pass from xfinitywifi. At least with Verizon I had a VERY reliable network, sure...it cost me an arm, a leg, and a kidney (j/k)  but I didn’t need the extra perks of netflix, T-Mobile Tuesday’s give aways , etc... I had reliable mobile internet without question. I have truly enjoyed T-Mobile’s affordable pricing, and their customer service is always super friendly but if their mobile internet issues and network issues are not fixed soon, we may be going back to Verizon.",1
Ever since they merged with Metro PCS the cell service has gone down hill significantly. I never have service anywhere and I’m not even in rural areas.,1
"Have been with them for over 3 yrs and everything was great until after paying my phones off with them last fall. Right  after that my account had an “authorized” charge in Houston for 2 newest model iPhone with all extras. I notified their fraud department and charges were taken off of my acct. Then again this week a female walked into a store here in my city by my house, and again bought 2 newest model iPhones with all extras. Both cases these woman acted and even signed documents as if it was me! And after the first theft there was a high alert added to my account which clearly didn’t work... Apparently I don’t even have the right to see the video recording of their faces - due to security reasons - even though both these crooks know who I am and even my address but my security just doesn’t concern anyone!  Lots of people telling me that it was an ‘inside’ job and I am done with this headache!",1
"I have been a T-mobile customer for MANY years...close to 20. Things have always been acceptable to me, a bit pricey, but everything always worked pretty well. I recently upgraded, and joined a 55+ program. That gives you a $20.00 break for being 55+, with a few strings attached. I already was doing what I needed to do to get the discount. Here's my complaint...They were able to fit my new equipment ($21.25 a month) into the billing cycle, but not my discount. Therefore they got $20.00 from me instead of $1.95. I don't know how corporate America sleeps at night. You can have the $20.00, but instead of a ""great"" review you get an ""average"" review. Sooner or later Karma will get you. Look at Sears with their predatory credit cards as an example. You should reward loyalty. I'm not somebody that lives and dies with my phone. I rate them as average. Nothing to rave about, and not much to complain about.",1
"T-Mobile used to have the best service before they merged with Sprint. Maybe they want to only work with brand new 5G phones. Phones that only do H+ ( HSPA ) and 4G LTE no longer get signal in many parts of the country. I will probably switch carriers so I have a usable phone. I plan to upgrade my 2-year-old phone to the Pixel 6 when it comes out later this year but I am not confident that it will work with T-Mobile either. I've always used Google phones because they have the least extra added software.There area where I have problems is in St Augustine Florida, Atlanta Georgia and l-75 going from St Augustine to Atlanta. Most of my issues are data issues. My phone is supposed to provide data for Android Auto and I also use Android Auto for my in car music. My phone issues are mostly in St Augustine where I would not be able to make a phone call from my home if my phone did not use my home internet service to make the phone call. They said there was supposed to be a new tower for southern St Augustine on July 4th but I saw no improvement.",1
"Hello, I work as an independant contractor in tech support and customer service for a high and spa company. I have been a loyal t-mobie customer for 4 years and have been referred T-mobile to many others. 4 days ago I received my new Galaxy S9. Today a client fell and knocked my phone on to a concrete surface craking the back of my phone in a spiderweb pattern. when I called about the insurance ths wanted a $99 deductable to replace it and would not cover my $1000 4 day old phone under warranty. I even offered to pay for the shipping. Lessoned learned! T-mobile does not warranty $1000 phones that are 4 days old and requires a $99 deductable after paying $1000 4 days prior. I will not refer anyone else and am now thinking about switching to xfinity mobile. I use my phone for business. My years of loyalty and $1000's spent means nothing to this company! Now off to the BBB for the legalities... Thanks a bunch for taking advantage of a sole proprinter and a fluke accident",1
I really have liked t-mobile for years but their phone customer service has fallen off a cliff the last few months unfortunately.,1
"I use T-Mobile and I give them 5 stars for free data across the world, but 1 star for the coverage, so I end up at 3 stars. :-/",1
"4651 w 6th st.Excellent service, very knowledgeable, really helpful with their suggestions.",1
I have no problems with calling but their internet connection is sometimes slow.,1
"T-mobile, after the BBB got involved, you finally attempted to make it right, the check got lost in the mail one more time, and you tried to short me again (you clearly don't have enough money, just ask Sprint) but all in all you finally corrected the mistake. So I'm changing you to a 3 star.I went to get my son's phone repaired at a independent service, and they could  not do it that day, right next door was T-Mobile. So we went in and we looked in to 2 new phones on 3 or 4 lines. I chose two phones that were both approx. $250. After hours like 3 hours and a card swipe of over $700 the clerk asks me if I wanted to put the 2nd phone on the leasing program. I was blown away, I said what did the $700 pay for and he mumbled some things with a heavy Spanish accent. I asked for the receipt and was told it would be emailed later. So I just left. Now we are signed up for service have only one phone, and have no idea what is going on. In order to see the receipt, you have to create an online account. I see there are employee assist charges, activation charges, deposits. I'm all the way out. I return under the 14 day policy and they give me all the money except the $180 deposit. That will come in the mail. well its been almost two months, no refund. So I call and they finally find the documents (which I can no longer access) and do a little math, apparently on one phone that was active we had to pay $70 for service, and the visa card has been mailed out. I never received it, ok, here's a number to Citibank to report it lost and go through that whole process. I literally give up, keep it T-Mobile. you are terrible",1
"TMobile vs Straight talkSo not to long ago I switched from straight talk to TMobile. I expected to have a better overall plan, reasonably priced, and to have faster LTE speeds. About a month into using TMobile I have really not noticed a change, in fact the speeds were anything but fast. I have lost service all together many times,it has reverted back to 3G a few times, more often then straight ever did. Their 4G must not have much coverage or something and lacks the performance I would expect from a higher end phone company. I compared it to my straight talk account (it's still active because the plan was paid for when I switched)  and I did a speed test for mps. Straight talk speeds were significantly higher compared to TMobile. In fact they were double the speed. I wanted to compare playing a 1080p video running on just mobile data. TMobile had a hard time loading the video as it buffered several time throughout the video. While straight talk on the other hand had no problems playing the high frame rated video,it didn't buffer or cut out once. Now as far as plans go, I  am on TMobile one plus, Supposedly I get 2x higher speed LTE over the other plans. Now it is a great deal or all it offers,10mps in flight LTE, I can text and what not in other countries, and and if I add another line they pay for Netflix.  But the plan is only $75 and I pay $90. What are the $15 in fees for? What are the fees? Straight talk offers unlimited high speed LTE, talk and text for only $55 and only has about $5 in fees. Ithink it's safe to say (for me anyway) TMobile still has a ways to go before their service is better. I think I'll stick with straight talk for the moment.",1
"Honestly, T-Mobile has been a great service ever since I switched over to them from Sprint but their ""360 Protection"" plan is an absolute scam and complete waste of money. I was paying $13 a month for a year a half after after I broke my previous phone and figured why not get insurance so the process is simpler and I can avoid having to pay full price again for a new phone. My current phone finally breaks and I find out that my $350 phone (now not even worth $120 brand new) won't be replaced without paying a $100 deductible. I could understand $100 maybe if I had a flagship phone but this was just insane considering I found my phone refurbished and like new selling online for around the same price.Long story short, do NOT get the phone insurance unless maybe you have a really expensive phone, and even still, I can see them still charging a ridiculous deductible that almost negates having the insurance to begin with. I mean, even with my middle range phone the deductible was more than it cost to just get another phone online. So yeah, do the math, $13 x 18 months = $234 that could have bought me the brand new version of my current phone where T-Mobile is simply giving me a pre-owned refurbished phone and STILL charging me $100 for the replacement, so really, it's costing me $324 to get a crumby replacement when I could easily buy an even better phone than my current one, brand new.So yeah, I give T-Mobile 3 stars because I love everything else about them but their insurance is just an awful scam. Too many hoops to jump through and then they'll still charge you through the nose just to get an even worse version (refurbished) of your current phone. Assurant is the company they use for their phone insurance. I know my rage should be focused solely on Assurant, but T-Mobile did decide to use them, so they still get a lot of the blame.",1
Not the best but decent,1
"Hmm, some of the experiences I have read here are what I experienced with Verizon! Verizon is the reason I switched to T-Mobile! I was with Verizon for 22 years with a perfect account (no lates or anything) and since 2017 it has been an absolute nightmare. Customer service is literally impossible to reach!I switched to T-Mobile about one month ago and the experience from day one has been the exact opposite of Verizon. I started calling T-Mobile a month before I switched peppering them with questions and concerns and being very skeptical. I heard promises that I also heard from Verizon which made me hesitate, but there has been one difference: T-Mobile has made good on every one of them! Customer service is dead easy to reach and every rep before sale and after sale has been personable and professional with the juice to get things done!I just got off the phone with them again telling them of my experiences with them and strongly stating that I hope this is not just a honeymoon! So far, everything they have promised and done has been backed up in writing as well!As for coverage, I was reluctant to leave Verizon coverage, but so far T-Mobile has proven to be at least a close second if not equal! On top of that, my monthly bill is $8 less than Verizon and I have unlimited minutes. With Verizon I had 700 minutes (although I never came close to using even 100 minutes in a month).So far, T-mobile has been a pleasure.UPDATE:Well, I need to lower my star rating by at least one. I have now been with T-Mobile for 1.5 months and the writing is on the wall now. I’m afraid it may be the beginning of the end for T-Mobile. I have recently started receiving ads via phone and email for “T-Mobile medical alert alarms” and “T-Mobile Banking Services”.Neither of these have anything to do with mobile phone service and represent a desperate money grab attempt. Too many pots on the burners and a few will boil over. I have seen this happen over a hundred times with other companies, both similar and different. They start offering unrelated services and get overwhelmed with negative experiences because they lose focus on the core business. Eventually, customer service suffers to the point of disappearing all together and employee moral goes in the toilet as all the service reps and technicians are fired. Customers can’t get help and eventually the company goes under. Sometimes it takes a few years and sometimes a few months.I left Verizon after 22 years due to this exact thing. They no longer have any customer service and tell you flat out that they don’t care. They don’t even have a customer retention team anymore!Next, I expect to see T-Mobile offering car insurance, life insurance and other scams.If T-Mobile keeps going down this path, they will fold. I’ll be leaving them before that happens.",1
"Update:  hurray!!!  T-Mobile credited our mobile account $784.94!I posted a story on the company’s FB page with hashtag TMobile and their customer service page and my FB page.  This detailed the facts on our reward and how we did not receive what was promised on the Bring Your Own Device promotion this last Fall (which is a current program too).After waiting over the requisite month for the reward payment and reaching out to Tmobile multiple times I was repeatedly and firmly denied by customer service at all levels in all departments.Having had enough frustration with “customer service” I reached out to the BBB and the FCC and was at the point of contacting our State’s Attorney General.I might note too that I did get an immediate response from the Tmobile T-force team when I hashtagged TMobile on their Facebook page, my FB page and the Tmobile customer feedback page. After lengthy messaging (don’t give up on that thread of communication) the T-force folks promised to try another claim and offer a full credit as a last resort in 2 weeks (which was today).I highly encourage anyone who gets shut down by Tmobile when you file your claim for reward to not give up. Hit them from the social media side and/or the offical complaint side with BBB.I was thrilled to get what was promised and look forward to a better relationship with TMobile.Don’t give up!  And let me know if you need encouragement in your attempt.Here’s the original story:We have been customers with another cellular service for nearly 20 years.  There are 4 phone users in my family.  We made the bold move to “bring your phone” to #T-Mobile and paid off 2 of our remaining contracts and were promised we would receive up to $800 for the move to T-Mobile.  Before crossing over to the new network we sent in our screenshots to T-Mobile and filled out the paperwork.  We were advised we would need to wait 6-8 weeks for the credit from T-Mobile.  After waiting for 3 months we called customer service and were told our paperwork was never filed and that we were past the one month deadline to re file our paperwork to receive our promotional amount.  When we were transferred to the promotional dept they said the same and that customer service would “escalate” this case and contact us.  No contact.  We called customer service in another week or two and were now told that the 2 month deadline had elapsed 5 days before our follow up call and that nothing could be done since we missed the deadline.  All this to say that we filed everything the day T-Mobile got 4 new customers to sign up with them.  They did not send us any of what we were promised, denied receiving our paperwork, told us we only had one month to file the paperwork, then told us they had extended that deadline to 3 months, and then told us that we did not meet any of their deadlines even with repeated calls to their reward dept and their customer service department.  I spent over a 6 hours speaking with representatives at T-Mobile feeling like I had when I was with AT&T.  I had hoped we were not dealing with another corporate company who just shuffled us around, but I soon learned T-Mobile was treating us the same way: with little regard for us as long term customers paying monthly.  We did nothing wrong on our end.  Is this the way a phone service treats its newest LONG term customers?  I will tell everyone our story when they say that T-Mobile is making promises to get new customers!  This might help you consider too what phone company you would like to pay monthly for multiple years.",1
"I have been a Sprint customer for 16 years and recently became notified via text message that I had to acquire a T-Mobile SIM card as they have merged. The options were to have the card shipped to me for $10 or to go to a store. I chose to go to a store to avoid the shipping costs and reduce the possibility of error. The closest store is about 30-40 miles from my home. I went to the store and was given the SIM to take home. The woman in the store told me how to do it and told me where to go to watch a video on the process. I asked her to do it for me, she would not, so I went home and watched the video to do it myself. **In small writing on one insert in the SIM card box, it states that you need to back up your voicemails or you will lose them. It does not say this in the video, and the woman in the store did not tell me. I did not notice and I lost all of my voicemails. That is not the purpose of my review though.** I put the SIM in my phone exactly as instructed, and my phone no longer worked. It would not connect to wifi. It would not connect to service. It was a locked and useless piece of technology. I used my landline phone to call customer service. I remained calm and tried to work with the agents to restore the use of my iPhone. The first agent attempted to assist me for 6 minutes before disconnecting me. I called back and got another agent that was especially kind. She attempted to help me for about 25 minutes before determining that she would not be able to assist me because I did not have a way to receive the one time code that she needed to send me in order to verify my account, and apparently my SIM card was faulty/did not exist. Because my phone didn't work, there was no way to receive the code to dive further in to this issue. We eventually found a way for me to receive the code, which was done by me emailing my mom from my laptop to ask her to receive the code and send it to me via email. She put me on hold to discuss with her team and then transferred me to another agent without telling me she was doing so. The new agent was not briefed on the situation so I got him caught up to speed and he attempted to help me for about 55 minutes, in the process, he guided me through phone resets that were unsuccessful in restoring the use of my phone, but they were successful in removing every setting, password, and face ID that were in my phone. He did not tell me that that would happen. At the time, I was just wanting to restore the use of my phone and wasn't even focused on the extent of what I had just lost. He disconnected me without warning. I called back and was connected with an agent that simply informed me that there was no way to help me and that I needed to travel back to a T-Mobile store and then disconnected me. I called back and was connected to an agent that assisted me for 47 minutes, ultimately resolving the initial problem and getting my phone activated to T-Mobile service. He also offered to send me a booster at no cost to increase service in my home. He discovered that there is only one T-Mobile tower in my area (there were 7 Spring towers) and that my service would be poorly effected by this switch. I was grateful for his help and his willingness to go above and beyond to help me with issues beyond what I was calling for. He was not able to help me restore my voicemails or my lost passwords/other information, but that is certainly not his fault. Every agent was pleasant, I had no personal issues with any of them, but they were not able/willing to help me and didn't seem to really care about the situation I was in. He thanked me for staying calm and kind and acknowledged how frustrated I must have felt. I would like to rate my last agent, Christian, every star in the world, because without him, T-Mobile would have lost a 16 year customer yesterday. I spent many hours of my day trying to do what they asked of me - not something I ever wanted - and it was a major inconvenience that caused a lot of stress. As far as I can tell, the only thing T-Mobile has done right is hire Christian. He deserves a lot of praise, and a raise. Christian, if you see this - please know how grateful I am. That is all, thanks.",1
"I've had TMobile for 14 years and have seen them improve greatly in the last 6 of those. I've always lived in an urban/suburban area and have had solid signal with very good coverage and data speeds. The LTE speeds in the 3-4 years have been excellent. Their customer service approach (teams with regional focus and follow-up to resolution) is far better than the past, and I had no reason to believe that would change according to inner reports from friends who are employees.In September of 2017 I noticed a drastic change in customer service policy/procedure - more calls to 611 than in the past were routed to overseas call centers who 1) had little ability/authority to resolve matters 2) struggled with the English language in their communication 3) couldn't relate to social and practical issues like addresses that directly affect US customers - all of which became more of a 'reading off a script' experience and endless cyclical talking that went nowhere.   In addition, any Twitter support through DirectMessaging was focused on hyper positivity, lofty rhetoric, exaggerated claims of expertise, and writing too much about themselves in an attempt to sympathize and empathize in obvious relatability - all which would be fine if accompanied with competence, accuracy, attention to detail, follow through, and a timely resolution. Because of these changes in customer service approach/policy, issues that formerly took days to a week to resolve now become lingering problems that last weeks to a month or more.I moved to a suburban/rural area that is still within a couple miles of a larger city, and according to antenna search/locator sites and an app called Network Cell Info Lite, there are several T-Mobile towers in my area, from 1/2 to 4 miles away with only one obstructed by geography (foothill). I never connect to the closest 4G tower, leading me to believe it's inactive or non-functioning. Doing drive tests with the diagnostic app reveal a very weak signal being br oadcast by most of the towers in the area, and even with full signal reception on phone (bars) the latency is very bad and data speeds are horrible and subpar - more akin to that of 3G or less.All of this information has been passed and communicated to TMobile over the past 4 weeks with little more than 'there are geographical difficulties' being reported from the engineers in the field.  This is only true of 1 out of the 6+ towers in the area.  I understand business decisions of cost vs benefit, and that unless/until a large customer base was complaining of problems they would delay or refrain from addressing such issues, but it seems there exists a lack of maintenance and ongoing upgrade concern/competence.  All the happy-talk virtue signaling in the world from customer service reps doesn't alter that.So I'm now experiencing what many others in 'less than adequate' coverage areas have experienced and the apparent changes in customer support have only exacerbated the frustration and unacceptable conditions.  This is my 2Cents.You can't trust their coverage map claims which are misleading, false, and blatantly full of errors.However, if you live in an area where towers are maintained and the signal is strong, their service is one of the best.  They really need to think through and work on their customer service approach - once again.**UPDATE 11/07/2017**After multiple attempts to contact a customer care or technical support person within the US by phone, I got lucky and reached a first level tech support person who transferred me to the 2nd level support. They took extensive notes and then created a ticket to be sent to engineers - meanwhile I created such an uproar on public Twitter messages that I was contacted by DirectMessage and they requested to call me directly to resolve the problem.During all of this, I continued to search for answers/solutions online. None of the support personnel directed or linked me to any T-Mobile online support documentation - but in my searches I found what I thought might be the problem. There was a detailed T-Mobile support document that did indeed provide some helpful information and could've been forwarded or linked or sent to me within the first day or two.Solution? The Personal Cellspot 4G LTE mini tower needed a complete 'reset', which can be accomplished by holding down the reset button on the back of the mini tower for 20+ seconds.  Up to this point, I had only tried 10 and 15 seconds as well as unplugging it for 30 minutes.  Once I did the 20+ second reset, the data speeds returned to a normal level (80-90mbits down, 30-45mbits up) and all was well.  I relayed all of this information - including the support documentation URL to T-Mobile support teams on Twitter and phone support and hopefully they will begin a process of searching for 'known issues' and FAQ's while assisting customers in order to actually resolve issues and to learn themselves in the process.",1
