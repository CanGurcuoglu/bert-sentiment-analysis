"Quite expensive, I was in the USA for some weeks and used it, would not fully recommend.",1
Didn't have many choices on prepaid phones if they had more prepaid phones then a bigger selection it would be all right,1
"Our internet is not always reliable. It goes out frequently weekly, but when it works it's fairly quick. Unfortunately the problem hasn't been resolved yet.",1
Poor customer service.Their fiber service isn't very reliable. Has issues that they won't admit to. And won't fix either.Plenty of issues either they want to roll a truck out to you but charge you if they find nothing or they want to replace your equipment when it's already been replaced twice.I won't give  them anything less because overall it's been tolerable at least in my situation. Unlike other companies I've dealt with that weee much worse. They at least have a small level of stability.But poor customer service and tech support is the reason I take the stars,1
"This should’ve been a one star, but Jerome ID # JW913Q Completely saved the day. For about 30 hours, I couldn’t use my work cell phone Because three different individuals in the customer service couldn’t figure out how to get my phone connected to the E-SIM. It took only 40 minutes and that is including me calling in and verifying my information so most likely around 20 minutes it took Jerome to fix the issue. If it had not been for him, I was getting ready to cancel everything.",1
Just reporting after paying off an ATT phone and not being on subscription plan the online phone unlock does NOT work.This forces you contact customer support force them to unlock your phone. Yes they trying to keep you on. There are services that are cheaper than ATT plans.,1
"I lost Internet service after 8 pm Friday 6/7/24. Called to report it and was told AT&T had a outage in my area and it would be repaired by 7 am the next day. By 7 am Saturday 6/8/24 my Internet was still down. Was told it would be Monday evening 6/10/24 before they could get someone out. I noticed on Saturday morning that the fiberoptic cable ,from the utility pole, was on the ground of my neighbor's property. 3 days without Internet is rediculous.",1
"I spent well over an hour and a half speaking with OSHAINE from ATT this morning.  The reason it was so frustrating had nothing to do with OSHAINE as he maintained his calm and friendly Demeanor the whole time and he did, eventually, through his knowledge of non published methods, get my Tv and remote working properly again.  I thank him sincerely for his professional service.Billy",1
"I was with another phone service for 3 years. I live in a very rural area and to make matters worse, it's in valley so service was sketchy and to add insult to injury, the rates kept going up.  About a year ago, I switched to AT&T and my service has improved 100%.  Customer service is always helpful and except for being gouge when I missed a payment, I have no complaints.  I'm on a fixed income so low cost is important but staying in contact with family and friends and being able to cal out in case of emergency is of utmost importance.  I'm sure glad I switched from Verizon to AT&T.",1
"The reception can be patchy in the ATL area, but honestly the prices compared to other providers are pretty good. I don't think I'll switch anytime soon unless something better comes up.",1
"Great products, not so great service. We have frequent outages in my area caused by a small animal chewing on a wire. I doubt that's the reason for the frequent outages, but if it is, why can't they make something that can't be easily damaged by rodents?",1
"The connection they offer is not very stable and don't bother calling customer service, they will just say the problem is on your end.And when it comes to speed, it is too expensive for what you get, I do not recommend their service.",1
"I tried att air for seven day trial.  It worked fine initially-faster speed, easy set up and cheaper than my current plan. However, a major issue was noted that caused me to return the unit. Air runs off of cell towers that only provide “dynamic”ip addresses (meaning that the ip address changes every day). This caused my apps(Hulu live and Utube live) to change location every day.  Got locked out of Hulu because of the 4 locations change cap. Requires “static” ip address.  Tech support said this cannot be changed.  So… back it went to att.A month later I received a-bill for $121.71 ( two months) .  I called to make sure we are not charged to card.  Charges waived. Told toDisregard emails about return,billing etc.Three months later I got an automated email notification that my account will go to collection for amount of $67.81.  Had to call to get this fixed since automated email would destroy my credit rating.  They (billing) saidagain to ignore any automated emails as account will be closed ( it should have been closed the first time).",1
"We have been an AT&T Mobile Phone customer for many years. Service has been OK.We upgraded our phones due to AT&T advertising - ""Upgrade your phone for Free if it is paid off"".  The Sugar Land, TX  Store did this but did not tell us about all the Fees involved: Upgrade Fee, Installment amount that they said we would get back later., etc. They said our new Bill should only go up about $1.00/month. This first Bill went up $98, instead of going down.Now we are ""stuck"" with a 3 year Installment ""loan"" for a ""Free"" Phone, even though there are offset credits. We asked when we would get the offset credits back, the store said we would get these first couple of months fees back at the end of the 3 year contract.We feel Deceived by AT&T. Misrepresentation and dishonesty.",1
"Decided to switch from my old carrier in January 2023.  Ordered the lavender Galaxy 23 Plus in early February 2023.  Still didn't have it by my birthday (02/26), and was told by the local store that somehow the order got cancelled.  Local store reordered it in and finally I visit the store to get it on March 14th, 2023.  I ordered lavender but all that the store had was black, as lavender is allegedly still on backorder... Had also picked out a lavender case before I even put in the original order, but at the store, no lavender cases.  Sat there for over an hour awaiting the data transfer, then $184 later, I'm out the door with the phone... only to discover at home that all of my calls and most of my text messages are still going only to the phone from my former carrier.  Didn't get anything that I wanted out of this deal other than a new phone, but I could have walked out the door with it from my old carrier for about $20 cheaper.  This is a horrible way to start a new relationship with a customer and I am seriously considering a return since I'm still in the 14-day window.  The employee who helped me along the way has been nothing but courteous and professional, but I feel like ALL of this should have been taken care of by now.  So annoyed!",1
I and others I know purchased a galaxy 22 ultra.  It has been the most frustrating phone I have ever owned.  It gives me more problems and has more issues.  I wish I still had my note 9.  It was great.  I believe something is wrong with the S22 Ultra.  I am far from happy with this phone!!,1
"First my email address was hacked then I changed the primary email, then I noticed they changed it back to the old primary email. Which I asked them to remove the old email from my account which they never did.My wi-fi on my pc is 2.4 when it is supposed to be 5ghz.I received a duplicate phone number however, the business that I received the duplicate number changed their number after I contacted them.They do not like to respond by email to complaints they prefer to call and then it's your word against theirs.I am not interested in going to another company, they should just fix the issues and try to keep their especially long-time customers. Now, I do not want Fiber, I am satisfied with the service I have now.Well, I received a notice that they are charging $5.00 more for internet, and I do not have Fiber. No excuse for the increase.The service was hacked, and they sent out a letter informing the customers, now they want to increase the internet service. Not good customer service from At&t.My former router modem which I received was not refurbished it still had old customers information such as parent child safety which kept me from making changes to router modem, so I just sent it back and received a replacement.What are they doing to retain their customer's?No Senior citizen discounts. lolJust expect better from them especially since my bills are up to date not that it makes a difference.Well, I will be checking out other internet services as of now!",1
"It is a good thing that AT&T provides me with good cellular service because I had a horrible experience with a representative when I was in an AT&T store to buy a new phone.  I was snapped at and spoken rudely to by the service representative. I don’t know if there is no training being given to these service representatives, or whether this woman was having a horrendous day, but there is no reason why a service representative should snap at a customer.",1
"I have a pre-pay plan that works for me. The only way to get any customer service is to go to my store. If you call you will be on the phone for a very long time. My first experience at the ATT store was awful. I purchased a new smart phone, my first one, and the man that waited on me told me that he could not transfer my phone numbers. He also didn't show me anything about the phone. I called the next day and talked to someone else and she told me to come back to the store and she would help me. I went in and she was very nice and helpful. I also talked to the manager of the store and made a complaint about my first experience. If I need anything I always call ahead and make sure that the woman who helped me is there. It seems that there is not a lot of good customer service at a lot of stores these days.",1
I've been a customer for over 25 years at the same address.  All of a sudden my phone doesn't work and my bill is paid.  They sent a Service Tech who could not fix things.  I'm so mad I could spit.,1
AT&T is getting shut down for good and being banned from the United States!!,1
"I had AT&T internet service at a rural location, and it has been consistently terrible from the start. I grew tired of constantly having to call them to complain about it (as they couldn't do anything to make it better anyway). Daily, we had to reset the router to get it working again, and the speed varied between 1 and 15 Mbps (averaging around 8 when it felt like working). After enduring a couple of years of this ""service,"" I was relieved to find that T-Mobile offered a more affordable solution.When I called AT&T to discontinue the service, the salesperson suggested ""suspending"" the account instead of closing it. This sounded good at the time since I was unsure whether T-Mobile would be worse than them. Unfortunately, the salesperson failed to mention that the service would automatically resume after 3 months.T-Mobile ended up being three times faster (without the resets!) for less than half the cost of AT&T. Needless to say, there was no reason to reactivate AT&T service. However, they still had my credit card on file, and it turns out they had been charging me for over 5 months—over $100/mo—before I caught it on my credit card statement. And please note that when I went online to check the account it was shown as disabled!When I called them to address the issue, they acknowledged the mistake and mentioned that it would take multiple weeks to rectify, promising a callback. I explicitly told them to close the account. Unfortunately, they never called me back. After seeing yet another bill, I called them again. This time they couldn't charge it since I had them remove my credit card from the file. During the call, they agreed that the account should have been closed, and the charge was invalid.I'm still waiting for them to call me with my $500+ refund, but instead, I received a notice from the collection agency for the money they couldn't charge me after the second attempted account closure. If this is not an example of extreme incompetence, I don't know what is. AT&T, get your act straight and give me my money back! Please!Update 1/3/24: Upgrading from 1 star to 3 stars. After multiple further unsuccessful engagements with AT&T customer support, I ended up initiating a dispute which prompted ATT Office of the President (top tier customer support) contacting me. Donato A. was able to help me and issue the refund as well as cancel the invalid debt collection. Thank you Donato!",1
Just switched my business to AT&T phone and internet due to the promise of fiber internet. Was previously with Comcast and didn't really have a big problem with them. Switched about 1 month ago and since then I've noticed about a quarter of the voicemails we receive are chopped up and cannot be comprehended. Fortunately I can get envelope information with the phone number the message was received from and call them back but the information in the message has to be relayed again which is frustrating for the customer as well as us.Finally made contact with AT&T and was surprised to hear that this has been a known issue that is apparently a problem with Verizon wireless customers leaving voicemails. The representative told me there is nothing AT&T can do about it as it's a problem on Verizon's side of things. The problem happens with Verizon customers that are within the state that try to leave voicemails. Out of state Verizon customers don't have that problem apparently.My cell phone service is through Verizon and I have left messages at my shop that are clear and have no problem.It's not the end of the world as I can just get envelope information about the not decipherable call and call them back. But people that take time to leave a voicemail usually leave information that I'd like to have prior to calling them back so it makes the process a little more inconvenient.AT&T offered no type of time line on resolution and told me it was a problem Verizon has to deal with not them. I never had this issue before with Comcast and only first had this problem come up the day we switched from Comcast to AT&T.Just a little disappointed in the AT&T service and the response to this problem.,1
I don't like there customer care. Very slow to get response.You Guys really need to work on this.,1
Good company but they could do better with their products and pricings.,1
"Customer service is the worst ever. Talked to three different people over the course of an hour to add someone to my phone line and learned nothing after that time. Had to give ALL my information three times, one time for each customer service rep.Phone service is good",1
"The automated system would NOT give me an option to pay on my own. Maybe this is on purpose because as nice as the lady was, you at corporate FORCE THEM TO BUG THE CRAP OUT OF US. FOUR TIMES, I said, no, thank you to her sales spiels. Stop bothering us and let us just pay the bill. If we wanted to hear specials, we can ask. The call at that point was so long, I died, dried up into a mummy, was reincarnated and then died again.",1
"the stupid cell phone wouldnt play the mp3 i got off gcnlive for alex jones or some file as i remember,yet i did like how if you ran out of data the internet still worked at a lower speed",1
"I have been with AT&T wireless for about 30 years altogether. They use to be OUTSTANDING. Without question, the best service and customer service across the country.Then they bought Direct TV ... who was sinking because of their HORRIBLE customer service. AT&T put in Direct TV people and they were destroyed.I have no customer loyalty to them any more because they don't value me.",1
"We live in a rural area, so our only choice was DSL. The bill is much cheaper than satellite at just $56 per month. It runs one or two TVs at a time, but we do have to deal with buffering if we try to use our living room and bedroom tv simultaneously. Also had a difficult time getting everything set up, customer support would constantly tell us something different everyday. I also wish this internet would run my tv and my daughter's tablet at the same time.",1
"The internet and TV works when they do but when they encounter issues, that's when the nightmare starts. Customer service sucks. Long wait queue just to be transferred to I don't know where. Would always to suck money out of your pocket. Beware of their scheme. For every call, they will sell things you don't need and for sure won't use.",1
"I was so happy when I saw that At & T added the extra HBO and movie channels free during the wknd and Monday and then they took them away especially in these hard times they should show some loyalty and humanity for so many people at home when so many other companies and people are helping with money and compassionate actions..Sad..thinking of changing after contract is over..Lake Forest, CA 92630:( :( :(",1
Hardly any Service in my town. At home I have to use Wifi to call and text. I work from my phone so i need a good connection and it doesnt get a good signal at all hardly a bar.and Ill be in the middle of town .Tell us in that area you dont have good service and stop wasting our money.They do have the Best prepaid ratesNew service here i come I cant deal with it anymore.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer since I bought my first cell phone years ago.  Last week I purchased a replacement phone as my current cell phone had ""had it"".  Was advised that it would arrive between the 24th and 26th of Dec.  Christmas eve was told that now it it would be delayed by ONE MONTH.  I cancelled my order and went online at Best Buy, and FOUR HOURS later walked away with a better phone. Maybe AT&T should just direct us to Best Buy!",1
"AT&T is the service I use and have had for the last three months.  I got the new iPhone 13 and I’ve had 5g auto on the whole time( I’m the settings for cellular), we don’t get 5g with AT&T in grants pass so my phone has been going back and forth trying to search for a network. Thus, giving me slow speeds and using all my battery. I switched my phone to LTE only and I’ve not had any problems with connectivity, overheating, or my battery just plain dying. I wish this was something they explained to me while I was there because my battery health, nearly in a brand new iPhone is at 94%. There was nothing that anyone knew that could be causing This issue beside a “defect to the phone” I’m gonna say it’s the “5g” networks we do not receive that messes with our data.",1
I have been an AT&T customer for 5 years. They advertise the best 5G..... I have one of the newest phones out...still 4G. It honey depends on your location. I walk into work and have 1 bar. They guy next to me has Verizon with 4 bars. Direct TV is a Rip off...... Customer service is horrible. My Note9 works great at home but unfortunately I'm at work more than home. They all have their ups and downs. I've had both and honestly will be going back to Verizon soon......,1
"They're a mobile company what do you expect. The service works, they provide good service (have used as a customer and as a business-business is better service!). What more do you want? They are a corporation making money from a oligopoly and should be regulated as a utility for the public good but that's not for me to decide.",1
"Does anyone really love their cable or phone provider? In my many experiences, AT&T is not the worst, but it is also not the best. Their mobile service is decent, U-Verse TV is average and incredibly high-priced, but their internet has been some of the best I have had in Florida. So, 3 stars it is!",1
"I, personally, have never had any problem with AT&T, but I will be switching to a different carrier only because of their support and promotion of OAN and their contributions to other issues I do not morally condone or agree with.",1
"Decided to cancel my ATT cellular plan two months back. Was promised a free Iphone11 on my second visit with loyalty service only to receive my bill and be over charged $10. Manager said there’s no record from phone call with loyalty rep that she offered the phone for free or that she promised a specific billing price that would incur until I changed plan. Att has no loyalty to customers, only to con their customers to be falsely offered something over the phone so there is no evidence of transaction to keep us happy until billing arrives. Unbelievable that there is nothing in loyalty report to support my recall of discussion.",1
"Better options available, Verizon much better on all fronts.",1
"Not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, not as good as they claim. Thanks, Kevin from customer support for trying to help me. Worked to a certain degree.",1
"I opened an AT&T account in August of 2018. I had to pay for one Galaxy S9, and I received  one free. A couple of days ago one of the phones just shut for no apparent reason. My fiance had to buy a replacement $89.00 phone for that evening. AT&T tell us that the phone warranty is up and we would have to pay $112.00 deductible in order to recieve the same device. She nor I  did anything to cause the device to stop working. I never had a device from any carrier who's device just shut down. We have insurance for damages, or theft only. How can you give out devices that can't last until the upgrade period is applicable. Each customer should know they may have to spend additional funds if AT&T devices decide to stop working at the time of purchase.",1
"Maybe I expected too much...not! Got great service initially from the folks at the Kiosk at Windward Mall. Was excited that they were going to have a permanent store there. In the meantime I went to the store at Windward City and when they felt like speaking with me (TV was on and they were busy watching) I got misinformation. That's okay, people make mistakes. Went back, got help. Went to the new  store in Windward Mall. The young man was sarcastic when I explained my question, (Do you folks have customer service training?) then gave me the wrong information (low storage doesn't always mean you need a bigger card in your phone), I already had a larger card in my phone but he didn't look so how would he know. I cannot wait to end my contract, T-mobile was a little more money so I moved but am happy to go back and pay more for great customer service!",1
"They are the only service provider in my area with any signal.  It's pretty expensive & their website needs to be calmed down, but at least they work.",1
AT&T appears to listen to their reviews. We will follow with their business promises. It seems none of us want guns in the hands of babes. Good choice.,1
For the money we pay for for cable and phone is to much all ATT DO IS SHOW THE SAME BORING OLD ASS MOVIES UPGRADE  WITH THE MOVIES,1
get your rural customers the service they need you cheepscates you don't have to be in the money day one offer package to all,1
Tried using them for a month. Customer service are not very helpful but phone call clarity was good,1
"Why 3 stars?  Love my reception and phone but customer service is lacking and confused at best.   In the last 5 weeks I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with them.  I went back and added up the time.... (it's actually close to 11 and I am currently on the phone with them now)  This isn't a COVID thing, it was like this pre-COVID.  If you ask the same question to 5 people in CS, you get 5 different answers.  None are close to the others.  Someone needs to make a manual and share it with the employees and give them answers to questions people ask.I traded in 2 phones about 4 months... still no credit.  Auto Pay is a joke.  I paused it (I never opted in to use it), but it took out money anyway.  I cancel auto pay and have to pay $20 additional each month because I don't use AUTOPAY. I've been a customer 10 years, obviously I pay my bill.The only time I drop calls is when I call them and they transfer me..... it happens often then, but that's the only time.The other options aren't any better, but I do wish they would improve the customer service over the phone.",1
I see tons of bad reviews but I like my AT&T service... I think it is reasonable for cost and the service is great.,1
"Have cingular then it became AT&T. Ive been with them since they merged. What gets my goat is, they have unlimited data, but have data caps. When its busy they slow down your data speed. I have an older plan with 6 shared gigs. All the new plans have unlimited and most other companies offer unlimited. I was looking at the samsung Z flip for my wife. ATT told me they would give me the phone free if I trade my note 9 in and agree to a 36 month contract I wanted to keep my $1000 phone. So I can sign a 3 year contract and pay off the phone every month. I wanted to do a contract and pay for the phone with an upgrade discount. But nope they won`t do that. I also pointed out that Tmobile is giving away the 128gig samsung z flip for free to new customers and add a second line and they will give you an $800 off a second smart phone of your choice. So what`s my motivation to stay with ATT when I still only have a 6 shared gig plan and they are offering nothing for upgrading your plan. My contract has been fulfilled many months ago and the company is getting cheap with promo`s so maybe consider moving to Tmobile or Verizon. Both are offering better deals and stealing ATT customers. They must have so many they don`t really care.",1
Good speeds in the Texas area. Currently on U-verse for my home office. They can improve a bit on support though.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer my entire life. My family was back when they were Cingular Wireless, and then I got on my own plan when I was an adult. I am in my 30's. My primary reason for staying with AT&T so long was the good coverage and reasonable pricing, because any time I needed to make any changes to my account such as get a new phone, it was a nightmare and took hours to get everything all swapped over. Well, that good pricing recently changed. AT&T does not include their line access charges in their plan quotes like Verizon does, so you actually wind up paying significantly more than the advertised price. I think the thing that bothered me most, is when I contacted AT&T via chat to see what could be done now that we needed a new phone (which required their unlimited plans), the rep kept giving me different quotes, lied (hopefully accidentally) to me and told me the total she gave included the line access, then turned around and said it didn't. I don't feel like AT&T is clear on the charges that will be on your bill and that's extremely frustrating when trying to pick a plan. And honestly that whole experience plus the last few experiences I've had trying to get new phones has prompted this review. Verizon was transparent about everything on their site. Verizon was able to offer us free Hulu and Disney+ with our current plan, so that reduces a monthly expense for us, plus offer unlimited.",1
"My recent contact with AT&T wasn't about their service, it was about upgrading to a new phone. I have had AT&T for a very long time and although have had issues with dropped calls, so has other providers. My online experience today was good, but the person I was chatting with had limited access and knowledge to what I was looking for in a phone and seemed to be unaware that what I was looking for does exist. I am looking to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 7 active and the 2 features an upgrade must have is Gorilla Glass screen, not a protector you add or an otter box, but an actual Gorilla Glass screen. Was told that it had to be purchased separately. Not true...my current phone the Samsung Galaxy S7 active came factory with Gorilla Glass and totally water proof. My next must be is water proof. Couldn't get a clear answer about the phone they were recommending about the specs of the phone which they say the Samsung S 20 Ultra is similar to what I have. That isn't what I'm looking for... it must have the Gorilla glass. Was suggested I could pay for the added protection in case my screen should get shattered... I understand the concept, but build a better phone and you have to protection built in like with the Galaxy S7 active. Having insurance doesn't help if my phone screen gets shattered in the middle of the night and I can not use my phone. Build a better phone.",1
Had an better overall experience with t-mobile.,1
They help me sometimes. Sometimes not very nice. Good prices though.,1
"I don't hate AT&T and I also don't love them.... I've had them for about 10 years ever since my ex-husband wanted an iPhone for Christmas and this was when they had the exclusive so we switched carriers and plans to get them.  I've been with them ever since.I travel a lot - and often out of the country - so I usually use one of their plans where I can use my phone so I have data, text and can make calls at a discounted rate.  It's expensive to purchase one of their pre-set plans for about $60 or $150.  The last time I did this I was saddled with a $220 phone call from a Kyoto (Japan) hotel to another where I thought I had left a favorite pair of pants (which I hadn't and were actually not even packed in my bag and were safe at home, bummer).I called - and they fed me some BS about how even if I had paid for the plan I couldn't use wifi and showed me where it was on like page 47 of their plan I signed up for.  It was super confusing and didn't make sense.  Instead of arguing I asked what we could do now after the fact since I had obviously tried to avoid that by paying in advance for the travel plan.  They backdated some plan for me and modified the call to about $30.  Still more than I thought I should pay but it was better than the $220.This happens a lot when I travel but the bottom line is, calling in and asking them or paying the $10 overseas fee to use it daily is probably best.  Or perhaps a SIM card.Otherwise I don't have major issues with AT&T.  They're pretty good as far as my regular plan goes and I've made minimal changes in the past 10 years.  It works for me.",1
Decent experience if you don't call their support team.,1
outrageous prices but... can't beat the service,1
"Just an averaged company, nothing special.",1
"When AT&T advertises a ""Buy One-Get One"" deal - buyer beware! NOTHING is free with AT&T!My BOGO deal was a ""free"" iPhone 7 when purchasing (signing a contract for) an iPhone 7+. After the purchase, I noticed a recurring credit of $21 on my bill. I thought it was because of certain discounts I get for membership in an organization AT&T honors, so I didn't pay much attention to the credit.Later, when I was able to pay off all my mobile devices, I noticed my bill had increased over $300! After arguing with the customer service rep, I was informed that AT&T had expected me to continue the installment payment plan for the iPhone 7+ for 30 months. But because I paid the balance for the installment plan after only 17 months, I was now liable for the remaining balance for the ""BOGO"" iPhone 7. I was INCREDULOUS!When I objected, the lady told me that I was informed this would happen at the time I paid off the balance. However I was never informed and told the customer service rep that if they wanted the $300 for the ""free"" phone they should take it out of the other rep's paycheck because he failed to inform me of the consequences of paying off the balance of the installment plan.Of course, she said they couldn't do that. So I demanded that AT&T should absorb the $300 because it's a misunderstanding and, after all, I've been a loyal customer for 25 years and it would be good customer relations. I said if AT&T would do this, I would make my satisfaction known publicly through Social Media. However, if AT&T failed to handle this in my favor, I said I would take that experience public on Social Media as well.The customer service rep paused for a moment, put me on hold, and voila! When she reconnected with me she said they had worked out a deal for me. If I ""technically"" put the iPhone 7 BACK on an ""installment plan,"" they could continue the monthly $21 credit until the balance of the installment plan was paid, with nothing coming out of my pocket! I agreed to this compromise, and AT&T has held up their end of the bargain. So, AT&T is now paying for their own ""free"" BOGO phone again.This issue was, indeed, resolved to my satisfaction, and ALL of the 3 service reps I spoke with were courteous, friendly, and competent.But remember, AT&T + BOGO = Buyer Beware!! Nothing is ""free"" with AT&T.",1
"Service in the UK is OK. But roaming abroad is a nightmare. Bought a data upgrade plan for use while travelling in the US but never worked once while I was there. Followed all the instructions for setting up your phone properly, including going through all the id mobile help forums and adjusting esoteric settings. But other users report exactly same problem with roaming outside the EU. Will be going back to a big provider at end of contract.",1
My number didn't seem to transfer over properly even though I used the switching service. The new number was displayed when I sent text messages instead of my old one. I didn't get missed call notification when people tried to ring me. I had problems for the first month which hopefully have  now been sorted out. It would have been really good to have been able to take my phone to someone to help me instead of things been done online.,1
The billing is not easy to understand My plan is supposedly £8 month but typically higher as I do use add ins but they are not explained,1
"What I like: buying from ID was easy and effortless, good communication too. Everything looks good, but! Probably it's the Three network, but rather often I have no internet access even when the phone shows 4G and 3 bars out of 4. It just doesn't work... Annoying, far worse than EE what I had before.",1
"The operator, while polite and friendly my issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. My subsequent billing was not very well explained and promises made by the sales team were not kept.",1
"The monthly contract fee is decent, unfortunately the internet connection/coverage is very poor. With the previous provider I had 5G very often, but here I haven't encountered it yet.",1
"Generally Ok but they will change your monthly costs in the middle of your contract.. what seemed like a good offer initially is merely Okay.What goods a contract if they can just change it at will?Everyone's living costs have increased, how about I renegotiate with you a little less? Is that fair too?Additionally they will continue to charge you full price for your handset even after it's paid off (24months)",1
I'm generally happy with ID service but there is one annoying issue which is very frustriting. Basically being recently in Central London and Manchester my mobile internet just did not work at all despite having full 5G signal recepton. I am guessing this is because of the fact my ID sim's bandwidth is reduced to near zero in very congested areas. I want to highlight this is purely network issue as my wife and daughter (also on ID network) experience was exactly the same. This is an area you need to improve big time.,1
Very poor internet. Although you get 5G sign on the phone but internet speed is rubbish on so many areas in London,1
"ID as a company I have nothing but praise for, cheap, great app, great online backup.I've been with them for years.Sadly though it's the now pretty appalling ""3"" network they run their services on. And it is so awful now I've had to leave ID.I live in a decent sized town and there's is now zero signal pretty much everywhere within it, and I can't get any signal in my house at all. It's got slowly worse and worse over the last couple of years. Yet despite repeated complaints, ID can't seem to get 3 to do anything, and 3 dont even bother respond when approached directly.So it's a thumbs up to ID, but do check 3's dubious network before you commit!",1
"Sometimes,signal is suddenly out of order, even the phone call, and it happened so many times. I have to restart again and wait for few minutes.",1
"I disliked the fact that iD list 50 countries that are covered in their roaming packages, only to find out after getting on board, that Italy is not one of the countries covered…… Potentially, I will now have to pay more on top of my monthly tariff ! Also, I notice that there appears to be no facility to add funds to use premium numbers, like “61054” which is a Greatest Hits Radio Premium SMS number. Any chance either of the above will change soon ?",1
Great service in terms of delivery. Good app and prompt delivery of new handset plus returns envelope for old handset. Unfortunately I’m still yet to receive the payment for my old handset. 2 emails but no reply!,1
Price of plans are very good however signal coverage lacks in a lot of areas especially for data even checking the coverage before ordering,1
"Never got 5g connectivity in the same device which I was using, while I was with three UK. Even 4g speed is not that great. Thinking of changing ID soon. Even in central London internet speed is too slow, than think outside London area. Also no call centre where you can get any help, everything online or a chat bot. Using ID SIM from last 45 days and not so impressed.",1
Very hard to get a costumer addvicer at them end of my contract I will change to a different net work,1
"Generally happy with the cost and reliability while I am out and about, but unfortunately I am unable to get a signal while I am at home. I did check before switching to you to ensure I should be able to get a signal at home but there is clearly a problem. My post code is HR9 5UF",1
I am unable to access my accout updates on my phone,1
"Great price but patchy network.I know they use Three’s network, so it’s not specifically their fault, but I regularly go through black spots and places where you only get 3G coverage - which is prettt useless these days.Thought it was a result of living in north Nottinghamshire, but had the same issues on the M1 near Daventry today.Good access along the country’s main motorways should be a given.",1
The service were I live is rubbish even though on the checker it said it was okI use the wifi calling when at home as the phone signal is rubbishEven in London it's a bit hit and missI made a mistake moving to this I'd and I'm stuck with it for the next 23 months,1
"I feel the price of contracts are reasonable but I tried to open 3 contracts for me , my wife and my child and they wouldn't let me due to some crazy policy and I was only aloud to open 2 which was one of the points I was swapping providers",1
Signal is patchy in some built up areas. Other networks have better signal in south Banbury,1
"Decent enough network, but not outstanding.Technical issue from 2022 still hasn't been resolved two years later: namely, can't receive SMS while roaming from non-UK numbers. Works on Three but not on iD Mobile.Cancelling your contract is laborious and talking to robots and chat agents to achieve, which is ridiculous in 2024.",1
Whilst the phone package I currently use is competitive - my ability to connect to family etc over the last 3-4 weeks has been disgraceful. At time I have been able to contact people inc husband who was sitting next to me …I believe ID use the 3 network..Will be looking for a new supplier after Xmas…,1
I am disappointed with the network signal coverage it  is very poor in alot of areas  with signal coming and going regularConstantly  1-2 bars 3 on a good day never seen the  full signal filled.,1
Affordable plansTrouble to signing in my iD Mobile accountResolved now!,1
Good service I just wish that the signal was better noticed it's quite low in most areas that I live.,1
"I’m with ID mobile for more than year, and happy enough. Signal is very average even in city centre of Belfast and text message sometimes last long until is received, long mean a day which happened yesterday and that is obviously not great.",1
"I am elderly and would like to have a customer service that I can speak to….to guide me through where I want to go.  I suppose a chat bit might do ,but not very user friendly.",1
Great deal with phone and sim but very bad reception. Can use phone indoors very often with data switched on have to use WiFi. And very often calls don't go through.,1
I live in a poor reception area and have considered finding better cover. There is nothing more annoying than when your call drops out.Your Web site shows that you cover my area. Sadly only poorly.,1
The lack of being able to contact someone at ID Mobile from the website is not good. There is information available on the website but it's a pain having to find it especially if the subject is not covered by any of the FAQ's and most of the stuff written by the 'ID' community does not interest me. It would be so much easier if you could email someone even with a short character limited message,1
At home I have WIFI so no problem but when I am in my caravan in the Malverns the 4g signal is not connecting to my phone my partner on her phone no problem she is with Tesco.,1
sometimes the signal could be better but overall ID offer good value for money and service.  some sort of app feature to identify and feedback poor signal areas would help identify areas for network improvement's to address the poor signal / no signal areas and also improve the coverage map to more closely show actual performance rather than predicted coverage.,1
Was trying to switch both of my EE expired contracts to id but there was issues activating simThen when deleted e sim had issues getting replacement as one was sent for wring nr and other not sent at all so had to pick up from currys .Overall contacted them on many occasions customer service very robotic and not good .Going to another provider now as first impression wasnt good as well as the signal.,1
I dislike the fact a new customer can get a better deal than existing customers  there was an I phone se 3rd generation for £19.99 a month which i took out and couldn’t keep my number if I got upgraded it was £22.99 for same phone with less data,1
I can never get an assistant at my local Currys when I go in. Your staff in the past have been very helpful but it's really hard to get a member of staff now.  As a pensioner I am not technically on the ball so find it very frustrating.,1
"Changed to ID as existing supplier was increasing cost for less , kept same number and the change over was faultless. Joined ID as received email saying 5 g available in my area and coverage map showed it was , problem is its not , on 1 bar on 4 G and download speed of 1. 5 MBS at most , the roll over data is pointless as not fast enough service to use the monthly allowance never mind roll over . It however seems that miss information regarding service availability is not grounds to cancel contact so stuck in a 12 months con which is all but useless . Customer se work from a script so totally un pre to deal with most cases. As seems to be the norm , any company that has communication as its core also seems to have Communication missing from its customer service.",1
Having notified you in August of my change of address I was disappointed to receive (eventually) your letter dated December—I have sent you a paper reply and instructionsYou were not the only people to ignore my change of address!!Juliet R,1
"I needed to change my plan to suit a new phone, but it just won't let me change. It is tolerable with the plan I already had, but I'm seriously considering going elsewhere. The process of selecting a new plan is absurdly complex. Given idmobile's reply about lengths of contract (why is it always something the customer has done wrong) I should have pointed out that I have been five years with idmobile, a contract has ended, and what I was trying to do was set up a new plan. I just kept going round in circles getting nowhere, their help bot didn't cover my issue, and their help line was hopelessly hard to reach, and the one time I got through they gave me advice irrelevant to my problem.",1
Poor signal at times in areas where I always had full signal,1
"Data coverage is terrible—it's nowhere near as good as O2, but you get what you pay for, I suppose. The deal's price bundled with other stuff I got was good, but the 5G signal is shocking. I have to wait until I can buy out the remainder of my contract to move back now, which is very disappointing.",1
Increasing bad coverage even in large urban areas such as London. Downloads on 4G painfully slow. Even when connected to 5G speed is very poor at times,1
"The signal I receive is very mixed at times. Even in a city like Southampton, I received close to no signal at all whilst my partner on another network had full service.",1
"Signal drops out, call fails to complete, people complain that they can't hear us quoting poor sound bad line. I was under there impression we were supposed to be getting 5G before the end of this year and 2 & 3G were closing down, well the last I heard from someone at ID was we have three antennas around us 2 were 2g 1 was 3g when do we get 5g on all our antennas giving us a very good signal not poor to average, in THE DN8 4SZ AREA of Doncaster",1
"I dislike that in busy locations I'm often unable to access the internet via my ID Mobile contract on my iPhone whereas other people not on ID Mobile are happily streaming videos and making Facetime calls. Likewise (and this might be just a quirk of geography) I'm unable to get online at all during about 60% of my commute home, whereas plenty of other passengers on the train can. I occasionally ask what network they're on; it's never ID Mobile. But, ID Mobile is cheap and when it works it's ok, hence 3 stars not lower.",1
Generally happy - good plan and price.However I was sent a notification with someone else’s number on it and could not contact you to notify. Eventually just deleted it. Would prefer a better means of contact to resolve such issues.,1
I find it difficult  sometimes to make calls when I'm out and about coverage is inconsistent or sometimes it will just drop Even at   get either 1 or two bars when other people with me get better reception,1
"I find the coverage is patchy when it comes to Internet connection. I often find I can not connect to the web when out and about in Glasgow, never mind more remote places. Accessing my online account is not always possible either so it's a good thing they allow you to cap your spend as I rarely know how much data I have left.",1
"Good the price and Europe roaming.Bad: a lots of locations no reception, impossible to speak to a person from ID at the time of need. It is not possible to use in North America under any plan.",1
"I have been a customer for the last 8years, last 2 on a sim only deal. Was going to change provider due to bad reception. Applied for pac number, but received a call from your sales, who persuaded me to upgrade to a samsung A16. Phone to big and to heavy, like a brick!!. Trying to return it has been a trial. My local Currys {Telford] would not accept it.Talked to a helpful person via chatbot [Preston].would much rather be speaking to a live person, would have been much quicker and easier.",1
"I changed my package last year from pay monthly to sim only. The option I needed was not available on the web site & couldn't be done by phone because there wasn't a human to talk to. I had to go into a Curry's shop & because they are cutting their staff numbers & the training of those staff to the bone I had problems. I had to go back 3 times before somebody who was plainly overworked, underpaid & therefore didn't enjoy their job helped me out. He was brilliant, I have to say. The phone coverage is a bit spasmodic but funnily enough better away from home than in it!!!!!!",1
Price was good but set up painful. I wanted to transfer 4 family numbers from my Vodafone account but 2 is the maximum ID will allow at a time?!?! My credit rating is good and this was less than £30pm total sim only - what’s the risk?!!  Neither of the two numbers worked on the change over date so both times I had to have a lengthy conversation with the helpline desk. Now that I’m on things are ok though often the phone shows 2 or 3 bars of signal but can’t make calls or receive data.,1
"Firstly, you don’t seem to have an email address.  I recently had a query on my account for 07964907016.  I rang your company and spoke to a lady who was not all that helpful, she kept asking me if I wanted to make a complaint.  I don’t want to make a complaint, but I do have a query on my most recent bill.  I don’t remember making the call on 27 Nov which has cost me about £13.  The lady suggested I look at my “recents”.  I did that and the only call I made was through WhatsApp.  I have a screenshot of that, but without an email address how can I get it to you?",1
"They shouldn't cancel orders with message ""you failed credit check criteria"" for 8 pounds / month - is silly. Maybe is valid in India.They should say: you can create maximum 2 plans under the same account, as a general policy of ID m.",1
"I chose iD Mobile because of the price, which is why I'm giving 3 stars.But the network availability is pretty awful where I live in the west of Northern Ireland. This is despite the iD Mobile website telling me availability should be good / excellent.",1
Don't appear to offer existing customers deals that are as good as those offered to new customers,1
"Coverage always good no matter where I am. Plans are wee bit expensive but not bad. Very difficult to switch plan though and the app is beyond uselss- tou can look but if you want to actually ""do anything"" there is ALWAYS - ""Oops something went wrong please try again in a few seconds""",1
"Early days yet, so far finding id suitable but time will tell.",1
"My husband and myself have both found  the signal very ‘variable’ these days unfortunately-We’ve been with ID for years and up to about a year ago was very happy with it.The ID app is straightforward , and the price is good- but sadly we’ve been thinking of changing provider and will have to pay more but hopefully have a better signal",1
"When using 4G data’s in my area, the reception is poor. Friends on other networks have a better reception than myself. It will probably be the difference next time, when renewal time comes.",1
Can't speak to anyone,1
For the last 6 months I’ve had a problem with my direct debit payment of £6 per month. Every month there has been a problem and I’ve had to pay manually. Even the agent tried to set it up and it failed. It’s frustrating that it’s so hard to speak to someone and that the simple matter of a direct debit seems to be un achievable. Another fail and I’ll find another provider,1
Lack of reception inside shopping malls and intermittent signals at bus stops when checking travel apps.,1
Booked a mistletoe  and martini break at thoresby hall very disappointed no celebration at all no decorations for Xmas.  Evening entertainment poor all we got was as singers every night no comedians or alternative entertainment at all.,1
the signal coverage is awful. I live in the city yet at home and elsewhere locally I sometimes cannot get a signal at all,1
"Bought this sim to travel around Europe with and it was a decent price with good data limits and coverage. If this is where it ended I would probably give id at least a 4 star rating. However, if you ever have a problem with your plan (which I have had many) then dealing with the customer service is a pain. You have to fight to chat to a real person in the online form, and when you get to a real person they are clearly just working from a simple script meaning they are not much better than the robot.To top it off, once I got back from travelling I immediately cancelled my sim using the id mobile app, however a month on and I have received an email saying I have outstanding balance. They have attempted to charge me an extra month after I have cancelled my plan and now I am stuck on customer service again sorting it out.Will not be recommending id to anyone.",1
"The signal coverage is not good, I’d use 3 network, I was with 3 and the coverage was better when with them.There isn’t a customer service team available",1
"Couldn't use my phone because I had allegedly gone over my limits, found this hard to believe when i took out a higher rate of payment a few months ago",1
The mobile connection normally in the mornings is hopeless. For instance when I try to make a phone call it takes several attempts to be connected.,1
"For someone who is not familiar with all the terms  used in mobile tech., websites and bills are not easy to understand.",1
"The price is great and I have a good amount of data.  However, the coverage in my area when it is cloudy means that I am unable to make a phone call.  As I don't have a landline this has sometimes been a problem.  This does mean that I might have to get another provider.",1
Reasonably priced. Coverage seems to be similar to other providers. Renewing or changing your contract is not easy online. They got my billing wrong when I changed and took a n age to get it sorted.,1
I got in touch with id mobile via my chat because I upgraded my id mobile sim to 5g but I wanted to keep my present id mobile number but instead of me keeping my number with id they put me a payg so how do I keep my present number with id mobile?.,1
Signal in my area is low. Intermittent connection unless stay out in the open space. Package is good at the time of taking on but now there are plenty of better deals around.It’s good but not the best.,1
"Trying to set up roaming abroad especially for Ireland impossible. Also when needing to contact you, it is again impossible, why can't we have a real person to talk to that will explain and hopefully resolve your problem",1
"I moved from O2 due to their poor network coverage,  and on the recommendation of my wife who is with you. The price and the move were fine but, despite several attempts, we were not given the £30 ""introduction offer"" promised. Poor effort I'd mobile.",1
I am not able to see on my phone how many minutes I have used on telephone calls. Until the app was changed this information appeared without any problem but it.now is unavailable.,1
Improve  the quality  of your network  i have network  but it keeps cutting in and out,1
Extremely difficult to get on website. Not sure how to sign in as it never recognises my email address,1
Took a long time for my phone to cross over to the  network from my previous provider ended up pay two monthly bills,1
Signal is very poor on this networkSome issues setting it up! I for some reason now have two phone numbers and the support page has not helped (not been able to speak to a real person just yet)Not sure if I regret moving from EE,1
"Chat looks like the only official way of asking and sorting problems.The reply between chat replies takes too much time and I can't stay not stop waiting for an answer from the id operator.What I do is to move out of the web page, with an ear set and listen to the click sound when they reply back. Unfortunately without this trick is almost impossible to reach a solution in the chat.Is a pity, I moved to Id m. due to the service quality. They should fix this quickly.",1
Cheap tariff but coverage is poor at times. We have several phones in the house all using iD sims. Some phones get coverage while others don’t even sitting in the same room of the house.,1
"Signal can go down whilst using phone and internet at the same time,experiencing areas with poor signal on a daily basis",1
"No help line using telephone not very good for older customers, so had to go to find a Curry's store to get help with my account ( very helpful )",1
when I was in Japan I could not use the mobile and when I came back it was still blocked. WHY? I can pay- just deduct it- In UK I have no complaints but if I go abroad I want a proper service!!!,1
Competitive pricing. I guess its what you get when everything is digital these days. Not the greatest customer service when things go wrong because they are almost impossible to contact.,1
There are some hidden costs to my tariff that if I had known would have chosen a different tariff/provider. I am charged for group text messages and the use of emojis in text messages.,1
It is competitively priced.My wife often gets much beter reception accross the uk on EECant freeze account when im notvusing it for months if i travel out of europeCant speak to a customer supportThe free roaming in Europe is great,1
"The ID company is good,it is easy to change contract online and they send the new phone to your address no hassle. The only issue I have is the network is not working very well the signal is not good enough. The phones are great and the price is good but the network lets them down so I won't be renewing my contract next year.",1
"Disappointing over all. Contract price - excellent, handset price - excellent, coverage moderate to poor almost everywhere unless you are roaming in a European country!It is difficult to get a decent mobile signal  most of the time. Typically only one bar and when mobile data is indicated as 4G on the handset the internet simply does not work. When 5G is indicated on the handset (almost nowhere) the internet is like ""lightening"" and internet calling is available, so, the phone actually works like a phone.Cheaper than Vodafone by a country mile, however, I wish I had toughed it out and stuck with Vodafone, no problems with mobile data/phone signal with them. I should have known that anything virtual and piggy-backed off 3 mobile would be a disaster no mater what they say about how good it is!Hopefully, the merger between Vodafone and 3 Mobile will go ahead and things will massively improve - fingers crossed. In the mean time, I would avoid ID mobile unless you only want to use your phone in continental Europe.Once again, disappointing!",1
Your fare EU travel usage if you’re in the Europe for longer than some weeks is unfair. The uk is no longer in the EU why would you need to introduce this policy.,1
"Cheap enough but coverage could be better, have to rely on WiFi calling at home even though I don’t live out in the sticks",1
My only problem with my ID phone provider is not being able to get any network connection when out and about. Everything else is brilliant.,1
"I have been with this company now for three years, Price is definitely good. The only disadvantage is signal is not the best in certain areas",1
"could not receive any phone calls, used web chat to get help the operator was useless and took 50 minutes establishing I was a customer, she could read what I had typed or chose to ignore it and keep asking her standard question, when i finally did get to explain my problem she said its too hard and would refer it to the technical team, they never go back to me. The support at ID is very very poor.",1
"Good value for money and the ID mobile app is user friendly.The mobile signal is not the greatest, 2 bars at best at most times of the day in various locations within Sussex.",1
"Good service until you go to upgrade. New phone, new plan 32.99 as an upgrade. 22.99 as a new customer. No reward for loyalty. Been with them for 6 years but am leaving once my final bill is 1 months rental. There are better deals out there!",1
The overall contract is good value - the mobile roaming among the best in the market.The upgrade process I have been through is ridiculous as there was only one possible SIM-only contract available without going through the palaver of porting off to another carrier and then coming back on a lower price lower Data limit.,1
Very patchy coverage. BT19 where I work is very poor. Friends on other networks always seem to have better signal than I do.No issues with ID other than poor signal.,1
Just visited USA and couldn’t get my phone to work while over there. I don’t like that there isn’t a contact number to speak to a human and everything is online. I don’t find it easy to find answers,1
Signal is bad in many areas,1
"Cheap but coverage not great, customer service is poor as you can't speak to anyone, best deals around for contract phones though.",1
Signal strength changes depending on location. Especially poor in city centre (London) where I spend most of my day working in the office.,1
Customer very good but 4g coverage in my area is poor,1
A good price but the internet is unreliable and at times unable to maintain a video call or even completely unavailable.,1
Signal not great in parts of London or east anglia. No roaming in Switzerland but does allow roaming in the Isle of Man which why I stick with them!,1
Coverage not so good in my area. No apparent upgrade early choice even though I have been sent emails offering upgrades,1
Can not understand why the price has to increase every year in line with inflation?The cost should rise for the consumables part of the contract but not the phone which was sold at a set priceNext PPI claims?,1
The reception for phone calls in the Denny area where I Iive is very poor causing the calls to keep breaking up.,1
"Phone fine, but had problems with account and password some new site adopted",1
Originally set up from catching warehouse in store but can no longer find a face to face shop to assist,1
Often no connection in busy places even though full signal,1
I feel that the iD(Three network) is getting worse in some parts of London.  E.g can’t get signal in London Waterloo station.,1
I got my daughters contract last year and the process and even porting her number was seamless. So I thought I would order myself a sim only contract when my contract ended. The website was a disaster! I couldn’t check out for ages so asked on live chat if I had been accepted because I did not receive an email to confirm! They put me through eventually to a call back! The woman on the call back could not find my Information so went through a new application with me! When the email arrived it was the wrong term 24 months instead of 30 days rolling contract so I did not sign it this happened twice!  3 days later I decided to try again and this time I could check out but still no confirmation. 48 hours later I contacted the live chat to check status (I took a screenshot of order number but it meant nothing to them) as I was going through live chat I finally had an email confirming delivery with my new number so ported my new number using live chat! Which she did and it worked fine! They offered me £5 credit which I took but 2 weeks later and it has not appeared on my account! It’s a good job they are good value but I bet the company is losing money because it’s inconsistent website and the fact that it took me almost a week to buy a SIM card! The value is very good however the point of sales really needs looking at as does the website!,1
"Dislike not being able to do MMS on the contract for the price it’s not very good, would expect it on a simm only cotract",1
Reception not as good as I had. OK but not as good as my last provider.,1
Iv only ever got 1 or 2 signal bars making phone conversations hard to understand,1
"Very bad network in London, it's not possible to use the data in London, sometimes even the phone call don't work",1
Signal is very hit or miss. I ride a motorbike and have to use offline maps most times. Never had this with Vodafone.,1
"Been a customer for a few years, so far experience good, signal not the best in some areas",1
Had a period when I couldn't log in after you switched off the 3g.,1
It’s okay but my coverage is poor compared to Vodafone. Price is half so you get what you pay for.,1
"ID are good at Customer Service, costs and offers however the mobile signal is often weak or non existent  in country areas - which is disappointing .",1
"Good app, easy to use, problem is they use 3 and the signal is bad and that's the most important part.",1
Extremely disappointed that you are still not covering USA and EU especially France and Germany (need it during my business trips)I Get additional costs on my subscription without real explanations.,1
"Service seems to go to non existent during rush hours , rest of the time it seems to work fine",1
What can you say. It’s cheap compared to others but coverage hasn’t been great for me. I’m in Essex so this may be area based.,1
I hate the fact that it is impossible to speak to anyone there in person...the website is often not the solution to issues I've had.,1
My phone reception hasn’t been great since I changed from Three.,1
I’ve choose this score because I didn’t realise you have to pay to send photos with this plan,1
Poor signal in several places including sometimes in my house,1
Good value but multi-device accounts would be good esp. for families or small businesses.,1
"Couldn’t get my billing right when I got an additional phone for my partner,",1
Good value but reception has become unreliable and there is no 2FA for account.,1
The coverage of ID at times can be frustrating,1
I like the ID network. Good value for money and the mobile data roll over is great. However tI have found the new ID app impossible to use. It used to be great. I'd  log in and then it would crash. This happened over and over again so I have stopped using it.,1
Cheap package but areas with poor reception and impossible to update account details,1
I get a very poor signal 1 bar even less in bad weather when staying in our caravan in Wales.,1
I don't always have good signals but other people in my household using different network to me have better signals. The network signals fluctuate.,1
"Cheap - but for a reason, network coverage is pretty poor outside of large towns",1
"iDMobile is good value for money - I think I have a very good deal.  But I have given it three stars because:1. The only way to contact anyone seems to be by chat.  When I had a problem with a direct debit (see below) I wasn't able to talk to anyone: the only telephone number I could find on you web site is for complaints.  So I had to use chat and my experience is that operators mostly seem to answer the question before the last one I asked, or answer a question I never asked.2. I changed the account from which the direct debit is taken.  I entered the details correctly and your web site accepted them.  The first I knew of a problem was when I received a text message telling me that immediate payment was required and that my account had been suspended.  To find out what had happened I had to first pay the monthly amount.  That was challenging because I logged into your website using my laptop, tried to pay and got the very uninformative error message of ""Oops, something went wrong"".  I ended up paying by phone.  I could then ring my bank and found out that iDMobile hadn't set up the direct debit properly - the money had been taken from my account but because the bank hadn't received the necessary notification about the direct debit, it was immediately returned to my account.  I opened a chat window to talk about it with you and for some reason failed the ID checks - I think my PIN didn't validate (and yes, I'm certain I typed it correctly; and I verified it was set to what I thought it was after the chat) so ended up having to submit a photocopy of my passport and utility bill to get your operator to communicate with me. The only saving grace was that this had happened when I was at home so was able to use my computer (which is not reliant on iDMobile) to research and sort things out.  It could have been very awkward had I been abroad.At the very least, given how long I've been a customer (nearly six years), you could have given me a few days warning before suspending the account. And yes, after all that, I did make use of the single telephone number on your site to make a complaint.",1
"Better signalVery rarely get 5G!!4G at best, but very poor signalUsually make wifi callsWill probably drop ID due to this",1
"The 5g works very well. But only the 5g. In areas where there is only 4g showing, the internet either stops working or works at snails pace. This is not the case with 4g in other providors",1
All good except my data appears to be turned off or limited in some way. I can very rarely rely on it when I am,1
"Signal is poor where I work and is a bit of an issue, would change to another supplier but can’t find another that isn’t more expensive so am sticking with it at the moment.",1
"I have two sides with ID mobile. I’ll try to break them both down here as to why this is currently 3 starsPrices - 5* I got ID with carphone warehouse. It is the cheapest deal around. 5G, 500GB per month WITH ROLL OVER? And a brand new iPhone and I’m paying under £35 a month? Prices are very goodCustomer service - no idea. Not tried it. Can’t comment. Would be unfair to do soSignal coverage - 1* - this is seriously the worst mobile coverage I have ever had in my life. I drop calls constantly, I have “5g” and yet I’m waiting on website slower than I would be using 4g sometimes, I can’t connect half the time in half the locations I’m in. Southish of England an hour or so out of London, signal is abysmal. I’ve had a mobile phone since 2003 so been using mobile contracts for 21 years, I’ve travel through Cambodia and Thailand and various other places. ID mobile where I am is THE worst signal I’ve ever experienced. Bar none. It’s crazy. I thought we were all on the same cel masts too?! So I don’t know why it’s SO bad but I went from EE to ID and my signal took a wild hit.So in summary, it works but I’m often getting a much lower quality product in terms of my service BUT I’m paying a very low price for it so I don’t know maybe you get what you pay for?If this improves I’ll update it",1
"Coverage very mixed.  Reasonable cost, but extra for things like multimedia texts",1
Roaming never work abroad,1
"IDF..YOUR PRICES ARE VERY GOOD, ONLY ONE COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU CANT RING FOR ADVICE ON A FREE NUMBER.",1
"Bought refurbished phone which was faulty, replacement phone was sent within 3 days, this one is also faulty but cannot be bothered with the hassle of returning another phone and having to transfer all data, apps etc,Would not recommend this service.",1
Is very hard to get hold of customer service within normal expecting time for a call center,1
Weak signal in comparison to others specially when in towns like London.,1
"Access to internet is patchy. Even at home when others are fine, mine cuts out.",1
"Very good mobile rates, reception sometimes poor.Good app.",1
"Reception can b slow , the signal is often not very good",1
The signal is quite poor in certain areas,1
Pleased with phone.      Needed to see and inspect before purchase.,1
Could do more to inform me of other tariffs.,1
On occasion I can’t get service and 5G or 6G doesn’t help either,1
The signal can be a bit patchy at times but the value for money is great.,1
no reception at waterloo station,1
Mobile phone service around my home and work are not great.,1
"Overall very good, but upgrades for existing customers much more expensive than deals for new customers",1
"Good price, but often get no signal, so can't make a call.",1
I don't always get a good signal when using the phone,1
Its average not great,1
Still waiting for your response for my request,1
Quite often I cant get a signal to make a call,1
"Poor Signal in Croydon and 5g is very rare,",1
"Cheap, but with that very poor signal coverage.",1
Not being able to speak to anyone when you have a problem.,1
No service most time in Bodmin,1
Everything is difficult to do or find out,1
Prices are very competitive but coverage is not brilliant,1
Many places cannot get reception,1
"Need a person to contact, chat bots are not for me.",1
Your connection to the internet is crap.,1
"I love the phone, but the signal is quite bad when out of WiFi",1
Signal is poor.,1
Poor signal,1
Having problem with network signal,1
I have found ID most times OK.,1
Occasionally difficult to use internationally,1
Good value for money,1
non very well,1
"Really good price and app works well. However, if you get into difficulty it’s all a bit of a support nightmare. If I have an issue I don’t want to go through bots and user groups I just want to talk to someone and at ID this in nearly impossible. So, would have been 5 stars but reduced to 3 because of this.",1
"After many years of having a mobile phone, they seems to do so many things, most not needed. The one thing that all mobile phones lack in is good coverage. It’s so frustrating when you are trying to have a conversation with someone and you loose signal! My dearest wish is that companies would concentrate on getting the infrastructure set in place. Then DAB radio would work and mobile phones as well",1
"Customer service and actually getting to speak to someone is very bad when you have a problem, otherwise when all working it's good.",1
Don't like that picture messages are not included in monthly allowance,1
Very good value for money although the coverage isnt great sometimes even in centers of cities or towns,1
"No issues with the service, only complaint is with the bills. If your bill is over your contract amount it does not explain what the cost is for, this should be listed separately",1
"The phone service has been good, but the app hasn't worked for months now, so it's hard to keep track of data usage and charges. This has been very frustrating.",1
The signal is not cover some part of the country.No 5G available.Good value for money. Good for using abroad.,1
"Service I average I can never log on to check usage.Networks is average, plenty of areas where there is no signal",1
Great prices and service. Just a real shame they don’t offer Apple Watch support. That is the only reason I left.,1
"It's a great network, excellent value for money including EU roaming. BUT! Try to get on the internet in central London and you will be bitterly disappointed! ZERO download speed. Even sending a WhatsApp message is a challengeCome on guys! You can do better than that.",1
"5G coverage is very sporadic.  Apparently unlimited roaming, but small print states limit of 30GB.  No means of identifying how much roaming data used on the app",1
"Customer services is fully automated, there is nobody to talk to. It's very poor is that.If you don't have a signal you can not contact your provider over the phone.I haven't spoke to anyone in the year I had this contract other than 15 mins on a text thing then I got cut off. I will not use ID mobile again.",1
"It's ok, not the best service but alright, nothing special.",1
"Don't know if it's my phone or ur coverage but my 4g is very slow. It can take an hour to receive a picture through messenger/whatsapp or to see a webpage, e.g. bbc weather. Person next to me in office receives far better signal. On the up side, I love the free roaming as I have 4-5 holidays abroad each year.",1
"Your signal is sometimes crap, you can't send mojos with a message I get charged my phone keeps loosing WiFi signal and difficult to pick WiFi up",1
"Easy to transfer, Although my monthly rate did go up slightly shortly after I had joined. Reception is ok, Not as good as my previous phone company and I also now have ""dead"" spots around where I live which I never use to have.",1
Roaming charges overseas very expensive WiFi in public places 😱,1
Roaming charges very expensive charged for WiFi overseas in public places 😱,1
The coverage is notva good as i would like,1
"Signal coverage could be better, particularly when I'm at home (DL17 postcode)",1
"Plan price and phone (Google pixel 7A) very good, Mobile coverage very sketchy.",1
I think ID mobile should include free picture messaging in their contracts.,1
Really poor service. Really poor product and really poor coverage.,1
Signal in north west England is crap couldn't use internet.,1
Tryed to updated to my pay monthly non contract and was told I couldn’t as no had my id for a year but as I said I don’t have a contract?? But have to wait a year to changeBut could leave and come back and update to what I wantedWas offered money back on account but never received that,1
No real criticism I just don't give platitudes,1
"More innovation as to roaming, packages and do not rely on consumers to stick with ID if there are no incentives/offers",1
"I want clear information when I go to a roaming country. I have sometimes received a message to say charges will be added, even when in one of the 50 countries where roaming is allowed.Why isn’t Switzerland included?",1
Internet coverage isn't great quite often I struggle to get a signal,1
The signal can be very poor where I am living,1
"Most of the time I am experiencing reception issues, example, if I am in wembley, willesden, hampstead gardens and some more places, some time it's make me  frustrated. I am thinking to change another better provider.",1
If your phone is stolen the online only help is quite laborious to navigate - ok in the end but a bit of a car sick journey in the first 36 hours - hint if you haven't got your phone you can't do 2 factor authentication,1
Signal is poor and drops out anywhere in U(,1
The coverage is not the best,1
My only real gripe is that when I’m travelling around the country I have to rely on free Wi-Fi my data never seems to work,1
"Works okay at home but abroad the roaming sometimes just doesn't work, there's no manned helpdesk and so no help. Also, it doesn't work on the tube, which is absolutely crazy.",1
Definitely good value but the data coverage isn't always great.,1
"When there is a good signal and 5G coverage, all is well. As soon as my phone says 4G I know I'm in trouble and can forget trying to do anything internet dependent. Problem is, the coverage around the coasts of North Devon is very variable. and even in populated areas you can find yourself with poor or no connectivity. When I was with EE this was much more infrequently an issue.",1
"I seem to get this transfer money message several times a week.I don’t have any debts? Or need anything that I could not pay for now. If I needed any extra money, I would apply to yourselves as first stop.",1
Coverage isn’t as good as advertised. Quite a few dead areas. Which lets the network down. Everything else works perfectly,1
"Under same account (aka email address) I ordered 3 plans, with 3 phone numbers.When I receive email there is no unique ID to identify each plan (diff. phone no.). There is no information to know for what phone number they write back.It is so much confusing.",1
"I like rates and the coverage in the UK,  however abroad it is so expensive to use even in a European member state such as Montenegro or",1
Trying to upgrade but can’t because 2 accounts are in my name me and my wife and use same email so can’t look what I have used.,1
"I have found id mobile great for my needs, OK coverage where I live and sensible pricing.  Downside is roaming in France/Spain.  It is advertised as included but the coverage/ signal strength is awful and rarely works.",1
Signal. Is terrible. Downloading painful. Once contract is up I think I will go back to EE.,1
"Coverage and 4g/5g is great, the app let's ID mobile down as it very rarely works",1
You don't send out any free offers example free coffee vouchers or discount for shops etc .your network signal has gone down hill the last 6 months yes very disappointed lately.,1
In the past I have found difficulty with logging on and have had to change passwords on a number of occasions.,1
Very good price. European coverage has been frustratingly poor for me.,1
Very reasonable rates never went up in the years that I subscribed. Left as I was having issues with phone reception in my home and I could get a better deal on data limit for the price.,1
I dont like being charged to send photos,1
"I get along fine with my phone,however it would be better if I could go into a shop and speak with someone,also to look and hold any new phone that I might be interested in the future. Joined you through car phone warehouse which no longer has any stores,that’s why I will probably switch to o2 when my contract expires.",1
Poor phone signal in my area. Otherwise great communication,1
Constant poor signal and could hardly ever use the Internet.,1
The network etc works fine but the app is a complete nightmare and won’t let me on it.,1
"Most of the time coverage is good, but sometimes it’s very frustrating when you need coverage and it’s not around hence 3 stars otherwise it would be 4/5 the quality of calls is generally good I have not had to interact with the service department so far which is good",1
"I travel all over the UK, and the signal is petty bad calls always dropping same with the data",1
Poor reception where I live and really find it hard to work out from the Ap when my contract ends - but I’ll be switching as soon as I can,1
"It’s ok, not the best service, weak signals outdoors",1
It would be very useful to have up-to-the information on recent data usage and cost incurred- displayed on your app.,1
"I have been having the worst signal since I have been with this company. It's so frustrating for me, tbh I can't wait until my contract finishes.",1
I have trouble getting a signal in my house and places outside of my home. Never had this problem using a previous network.,1
Both me and my wife have been with ID for years. Good network and Curry's are great if you have an issue.DOWNSIDE WHICH HAS ONLY BECOME AN ISSUE IS BILLS ARE NOT COMING IN AT WHAT THEY SHOULD. PREMIUM RATE TEXTS BEING APPLIED. NOT GOOD FOR OUR FUTURE CHOICE OF NETWORK,1
"It's ok,Internet drops out now and again so that can be annoying",1
I go bike riding and struggle to get a signal when out on my bike along the Merseyside river front.Worried that the same thing could happen if out in the countryside.,1
"Good reception when needed is most important. SK8 3TL IS 1 bar at best.Id replied no issues in the area and try switching to 4G, 1 bar at 4G is what I get. My wife also has the same issue so no point in trying sim in another phone. SK8 3TL is just poor coverage.",1
"I have no online facilities, It is too difficult to get support from id mobile . I need to be able to phone a help line to speak to someone if I have a problem with my phone, as I can’t search through a website!",1
The reception is not always good plus WhatsApp doesn't always work People cannot ring on it.,1
"Good price but loads of missed calls, voicemails sometimes come through a day or so later. Coverage pretty good, overall good generally for what I need.",1
"When i make phone calls and have to give numbers out the person at the other end cant hear.....just numbers, conversation ok.The help option is useless so camt get to the bottom of the problem.",1
Good low cost mobile connection. Difficult to speak to any customer service staff about an issue I have!,1
Generally happy with it but I wish they had a phone number to use for questions as well as a chat facility,1
I can't go over my data plan or use competion numbers.,1
"The internet reception can be very patchy. On recent holidays to Scotland and the Med, while my wife (using the same model phone) was able to access the internet, I could not get reception. This has happened a few times in different places and I am seriously considering changing providers.",1
Got repeated emails informing me it was time to upgrade my phone. However on trying to so and swap my package i was informed it was a 60 wait. Will be changing suppliers when contract now ends.,1
The price rise half way through the contract is extortionate and really takes the mickey.,1
"Although I live in London (only 4 miles from Trafalgar Square!), the ID Mobile signal is often very poor in my house, and street.  It's similar to what I would expect somewhere remote, like the Scottish Highlands.  Not very impressed.",1
I have to contracts with you mine and my sons and am struggling to pat for them every month,1
Mostly fine but still concerned that someone managed to get through your security system identifying as me to order an E-SIM some months ago and on that basis got into my online bank account with a view to fraud. The fraud was rectified by my bank but caused me to lose some confidence in ID Mobile.,1
Signal isn’t very good,1
Value for money but poor coverage in rural areas,1
There is lots of places i go where i get no signal st all i think this is very poor  for the size of your company  and will be leaveing  when my contract is due,1
There is no phone number to contact. Online communication is helpful but not meet all needs. Some needs cannot express online and need someone to talk.,1
ID Mobile don't give the same deals to existing customers that they do to new customers. You have to phone and threaten to switch to another provider to get a good deal.,1
Not enough information on app about contract end dates and if it is possible to change plans when in or out of contract.,1
Lack of contact with real person. Bot sent me round in circles without solving problem.,1
Like the price and the amount of data.Dislike how often I am unable to make or receive calls even when I have enough signal strength on 3/4/5 g.Sometimes I’m swapping SIM cards to make a call!😡,1
"Like the App when you can get into it. Using the App from my mobile keeps advising ""unable to connect to ID Mobile, Try again"". Tried deleting and reinstalling App but no changes.",1
No roaming in USA so had to buy another SIM card.Impossible to get any advise or talk to someone from ID mobileSignal strength and coverage is very good,1
"Very weak unreliable reception, unfit to run 2 devices at same time, so had to change to other provider with stronger WiFi strength.",1
"Overall it's a really good service. But I have been trying for ages to transfer an account I took out years ago for my daughter.She wants to stay with iD, keep her number and take over paying the account but I'm told this is not possible.",1
Poor serviceBetter coverage,1
"Firstly, the current iD Mobile app, which replaced a perfectly good one about a year ago, is very poor. Owing to a technical fault, it deletes the record of the registration / biometric setup process when the app is closed, so I have to re-register every time I open it. Also, the data usage graph is confusing, there is no indication of how many minutes of calls I've got left, and the details of my plan aren't given (they only appear on the bills).Secondly, while on a Channel crossing to France, the phone logged on to a non-UK and non-EU network without warning and I was charged for roaming beyond the permitted areas: very poor indeed.",1
Coverage at home is 5G full signal but at work in Chelmsford it’s barely one bar of 4g and sometimes it’s just 3G which is annoying. Not sure why this is but on the whole the coverage is fine.,1
It would be nice to actually speak to a  person rather than just a automated service. On the very few occasion I have managed to get through it's been extremely difficult to actually navigate to the department you require and the call is ended simply saying try the app. I've experienced difficulty in  communicating due to  language barrier from some of the  staff at the call center. If this occurs it may nice to be transferred to another colleague who can help.On the question of Date of experience I unfortunately can not submit a date as I've give up trying to call I use the app which again does not give you a option to call should you need it. Very frustrating from the customer that you don't offer this as a service provider. As a customer the satisfaction is some what disappointing..,1
I just find alot of people say  when I am on a call I fade in and out ...dont think it is a problem with the phone but with the network,1
"I don't have very good connection for my area and where I work, across south and west Wales 😞Thankyou for quick response with suggestions, much appreciated idmobile",1
"After a system update,  my phone stopped working.  Apparently the update made changes that were not compatible with my phone.  No notification was given to me and I had to get a new phone.",1
"OK but reception iffy in some areas probably due to 3G switch off, may go to an EE MVNO eventually.",1
MMS is very expensive but apart from that the contract price is very low.However... what's the point of unlimited mobile data if it's slower than a dial-up modem 🤨,1
I couldn’t get to my voicemail whilst on on holiday in Cyprus.Why does voicemail insist on reading out the long number instead of saying who the message is from?Why isn’t the first option on voicemail to delete the message?,1
"I don’t like that my monthly cost is more than advertised, I can’t send photos to friends or respond to certain text messages from for example my local council confirming no change on our electoral status without you charging me.  Wont be renewing my contract.",1
My phone calls to and from me are never very good..my contacts break up and I break up to them...when travelling in Europe I can never get or receive calls???My husband has his contract with you and never gets any problems 🤷‍♀️,1
My only concern about ID Mobile is that I lose reception on my phone quite a bit and need to go to specific places in the house to get a good reception,1
Rollover data is fine. But the network suddenly started having many issues,1
Phone keeps cutting out during call  and we had to practically talk twice plus the other caller couldn't hear us and these were mainly local calls. we thought it was something to do with the network,1
"Since you up dated the ID mobile app I havnt been able to log in keeps saying don't recognise my phone number very frustrating as I used the app alot to check thingsAlso not happy you can't talk to anyone on the phone about anything anymore when you need help to sort the app ,online support is again very frustrating don't understand what your asking I've been customer for many years and because of this thinking of changing as want an app on my phone that works to use and to be able to speak to a human on the phone if any problems",1
"Difficult to talk to a actual person if you have problems which I did, my phone keeps saying not registered on this network when I try to phone out this occasionally happens",1
"All of the family are with ID mobile and are all very pleased with the cost/service.  The only reason that I have given it 3 stars is due to the fact that you can't change your mind until after a set period of time.  I purchased a Samsung (always been happy with Samsung) but after my daughter had an iphone I realised how good the quality of their photos was and tried to change, unfortunately you can't until your 2 year contract is virtually up.  It's a shame, I didn't want to leave ID mobile so you wouldn't have been losing my custom but I still couldn't change.",1
"I have not been satisfied with your services lately. very often it is very slow, but sometimes there is no internet at all. I don't understand how it can be, because I see that there is a signal but no internet, this has happened many times before. So now I'm thinking of looking at a more serious company.",1
Extremely concerned about security at ID and we've had no answers,1
"I bought a prepay SIM for free roaming in Europe. It was easy to set up, and good value for money.However they ran a hard credit check against me which affected my credit score, even though it was for only around £5 a month.Also when I wanted to cancel they still charge another 30 days which is unreasonable. Furthermore the plan can't be paused so I could only use the SIM once.",1
The Internet speed is slow and every time I check the service status in my area it is saying working on some issues and currently some maintenance is being carried out in the area.  Well I don't believe that. Generally the speed is slow ant that is just an excuse.,1
"Poor Customer service, app did not recognise my numbers",1
"The web mobile signal is poor, although the signal for mobile calls is good enough.",1
Reception not good. After being on a call for a while phone keeps cutting out,1
Sometimes the phone doesn’t ring and I either get a voicemail or see missed calls when I next check my phone,1
"My SIM card suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls, which was very inconvenient. It was difficult to contact ID mobile and the chat bot was very annoying. Finally had a live chat with agent but very slow. Hopefully a new SIM will be delivered soon",1
"You cannot talk to a person,cannot set up voice mail every password I choose say,s not allowed.",1
"I'm not really happy, the signal is awful, whether it's at home or away. Never have I experienced this as much as I have with iD Mobile.Also when I go to make a call, it doesn't ring on my phone, as if it's not connecting. But when it's been my Mum I've phoned it rings her end.Never ever have I had this.I can be on a call then all of a sudden it disconnects, which is very annoying if it's a call that's took me ages to get through too!So really not happy with this.",1
Good for the price and flexible options. Would have been 5 stars if the App was better.,1
I have been ID Mobile customer for some years and always found them value for money but since they updated their App I have been unable to access it or get access to my bills. Support and customer complaints have not been any help even though very apologetic and polite.Note. Recontacted today and somehow they have managed to fix the issue with the app that wasn't working yesterday. Pity it took over 6 months.,1
The signal reception in Rainworth is very poor.,1
Two things.1. Can’t speak to a real human person when needed.2. Orders missing and have to get it yourself from store.,1
Unfortunately we can not pay more to get roaming in Thailand,1
Your price and packages are good BUT coverage in my home Town is now non existant! If it’s not resolved I’ll have to move - it spoils a night out 😡,1
Every time I went out of the country to places that were supported I could not send messages on WhatsApp of I message which was what I was told that I would be able to do and I was continuosslt running out of data so I had payed my monthly bill and at the start of the month I lost all of my data this happened multiple times!!,1
Love the idea of any unused data rolling over to the next month.Can't always get connection,1
ID need to have data access activated in more countries .. I do some travelling and fine it very frustrating not having data access,1
id mobile are a well priced provider but signal coverage indoors is dreadfull so most of the time iam usung wifi calling that is included thankfully but the so called 5g coverage not so much good luck in your area 4g works out side ok,1
"Mobile phone service is good but trying to view your account online or in the app are abysmal! Works one time, if you’re lucky but not the next!",1
I tried for one month to login on my ID app ! It was impossible !!! Can you fix this problem please ? Thank you,1
Customer service is very difficult to contact and has a lot of potential to be more helpful and capable.,1
Unable to fix problems in an appropriate time,1
"The mobile reception around our home is terrible, no matter how much I complain it seems nothing is being done to sort this black spot we have.We also find your system of different email addresses for each mobile number we have with you very difficult to manage.You seem to have a very strict credit application criteria with little or no helpful comments to say why the mobile contract has been rejected.",1
Poor reception at times in border areas. Slow to roam at times.,1
"Poor reception coverage in many areas, too many times looking at the 4G one notch in the top right corner of my phone.",1
The price is good that's about as far as it goes extras cost and there not cheap I just get by with what I get,1
All good and fine in UK but couldn't make for the love of God make data work in roaming. No issues with calls and texts though...,1
Overall reasonably happy although there are still times when I can't access data without being connected to wifi. Usual trick of turning off wifi on mobile doesn't work in these occasions which is quite freustratijg,1
In some areas there is poor or NO coverage. The signal quality is very poor in areas where I need it.,1
"Signal keeps randomly dropping out mid call. This is down to 3 mobile who are the carrier. It used to be fine when I had a 3 contract (same phone) and then as expected OK with idMobile (MVO) for a few years. Now drops the call occasionally.>Reply from iD Mobile>An hour ago>>Hey there, we're very sorry to hear you're having >issues with coverage.>>Please take a look at our coverage checker, which will >show you what your signal strength should be like in >your area, for all of 3G/4G/5G, for both indoors and >outdoors.>.idmobile.co.uk/ help-and-advice/coverage#coverage-info>>Furthermore, please take a look at our network >partner Three's network status checker, which will >show if there is any maintenance or performance >upgrades going on in your area.

Of course I do. I was a telecoms software engineer for many years including mobile. The reason why the calls now drop out is because in this area, 3 have removed a number of older transmitters replacing them with fewer 4G/5G transmitters resulting in more fringe areas (grey spots) until they start to backfill. I live in a small market town close to a major new city and not some rural back area. A similar and well documented situation existed when t-mobile merged with Orange to become EE and EE removed far more duplicate transmitters that they should have done basing this on computer modelling coverage rather than actual real world coverage. OFCOM became involved and EE had to fix it.  Going back to idmobile and 3 , I am expecting (and hope) this call drop out problem to substantially reduce once 5G covers this area. Or more to the point, 3 commission the currently idle masts. Having said all that, I was a direct customer of 3 for many, many years but moved to idmobile roughly for the same price. Idmobile have a far superior and easy to use website, data-rollover, and inclusive international roaming covering much of the world that 3 used to cover. I have no intention of cancelling my idmobile contract.",1
Would be good but 4g does not give me dataReally struggling at the moment with data on 4g. 5g is fine and can even work on 3g but not 4g. Help!,1
"Cheap phone deal, but customer service is awful when problems occur",1
Poor 4G service in many places in UK but a much better signal in the places I've been to in Europe. ID mobile say they are working on improving 4G but they probably are not.,1
Right level of communication eg good customer care and no over selling. Unfortunately service cover can be patchy especially when im at home. I need to go to certain areas of my house to be sure of getting a good enough signal to make/recieve calls which is annoying. Good product range and price.,1
Fair price for packageMeets most of my needsGood signal strength outside my home but inside signal can be weak /patchy,1
Reception is terrible,1
"Had a problem texting my wife who is also  an ID mobile customer for weeks, got fed up going to CarphoneWarehouse as they didi nothing to help. So, all our communications are being done on Whatsapp, BUT, occasionally I forget to Whatsapp, and text and they go through.",1
"Signal here in West Cornwall is not brilliant. Also texting is annoying, especially to my wife, or anyone else on an I phone, as the network seems confused as to how the message is sent. i.e keeps trying to send via Wi-Fi instead of ordinary SMS. iD Mobile is good at dealing with spam texts though which is good.",1
Very good service in Cuurys setting up my new phone.  No other experience,1
"Inability to have a family account.I have set up accounts for myself, my wife and two children with ID but cannot have one account to manage all of us. It makes it very difficult to have four separate email addresses to access their accounts and manage the spend/usage, especially for the children.",1
Good service from ID …. Not sure about the 3 network ….. not as good as what 3 seems to think it is,1
"Firstly your signal coverage and call quality is very good, including abroad. Also the ability to use my phone as at home whilst abroad is very useful. On a day to day basis I'm very pleased.Where I feel let down by you is twofold. If ever I need to contact you I'm unable to talk to anyone. I'm forced to use your chat system. This makes me feel somewhat disconnected from you and being kept at arms length. I'm sure it's vastly cheaper for you, but I question it's customer service.Also I recently changed my call package with you to a cheaper one. This suited my needs and my pocket. I was told that there was no way I could keep my existing number. One I had for over a decade. Being able to miraculously keep while swapping services providers, including yourselves! I've also noticed you can magically keep your original number if you upgrade or swap to your heavily promoted offers. Having to change my number has caused some amount of stress and I'm still not 100% sure everyone has my new number even now.",1
"Signal, especially mobile data is very poor a lot of the time.",1
Switzerland isn’t included in your European countries,1
Poor network coverage.Data is almost unusable.,1
"Overall good reception but in quite a few time I have no signal at all,Very disappointed.",1
Great communications and price but the signal in my area is inconsistent and regularly drops off during calls.,1
A good price but for me the network strength is poor.,1
"Massive data allowance for a small price, but comes with issue where some major towns, e.g Keswick have phone coverage but no data which for a tourist spot isn’t good enough.In regards to the reply, I have already checked the websites mentioned for issues and none are reported. I have used the community board for help but I get the same response from there.",1
Poor signal in some places or slow Internet speed..,1
"Coverage. I’m having issues with coverage. I’m in Cornwall, coverage on the main roads seems ok but as soon as you move away from arterial roads the signal will just about disappear. I’d have thought that Three your provider would have been able to get a better network coverage. It doesn’t appear to have gotten better in the last eight years since I was last in Cornwall.",1
Very few places where I am getting 5G signal. Poor signal or very poor signal in most other areas I have been to. Very disappointing.,1
"ID Mobile gives fantastic offers, they would do much better with working on communication, training and admin staff.2 weeks ago I did but a sim only plan on line, easy and swift process. in 1-2 days I received the email with transaction number and instructions how to port the mobile. I followed the instruction and provided my PUK code for porting my number from previous provider to ID Mobile, what happened after was very disappointing.As per the emails Sim was sent, No tracking number, Sim was sent by “2nd Class Royal Mail”, Porting the mobile followed on the day specified while the Sim Card never arrived!!This did result in me loosing the mobile service completely. I am a surgeon and I do on-calls which mandate that the hospital reaches me via mobile. Was not very pleasant scenario.I tried to communicate with ID Mobile, they have this frustrating form of AI assistant that loops around itself and never gives you answers but provides you with links for forums. After 2 more days I managed to “Chat” to a customer service on line. The lady advised that I need to go to “Currys” as ID Mobile is a trade name for Currys, She advised to take a photographed ID so they can provide me with a Sim and activate the line with my old number. This looked too easy for me to believe, I had a copy of the chat emailed to me.As soon as I finished work, picked my passport and went to Currys, Exactly what I expected, David at Currys says: Sorry sir, this is very wrong information, I can only give you blank sim and you have to call them. Trying to explain that “There is no one to talk to and no number to help” did not add much to this waste of time conversation.Just to note, the chat service is only available until 18:00 then it gives you automated response.I went back home and fiddles online to find that I can simply do the porting on line via an authentication code that they will send to my mobile “That I do not have” !!Following some further search and frustration, I managed to get the code via my email I used to purchase the plan !During activation, it gave me at least 15 times message that “Something is wrong, try again”. Following 20 attempts, I got a different message that this sim card was previously activated !!Testing the sim card, It started working. HallelujahConclusion:ID Mobile has not trained its staff to know what are they managing or advisingID Mobile is sending important Sims after activation with untracked 2nd class Royal Mail! If someone gets hold of your mobile, may become able to get authentication codes for all your bank accounts..etc. Dangerous practice. Please use a safe tracked serviceID Mobile has a very poor customer service level as it is all on-line but very limited to probably one employee on the other side of the globe !For Customer:Do not port your number until you receive the Sim CardDo not try to communicate with ID Mobile, you will get frustrated and get no where.If you face my situation, Get a blank Sim from Currys, click, lost or damaged sim, for replacement, you will manage to do it online provided that you have registered with them your email.Conclusion:I will see how will the service go, I may buy again from them is phone and net service is satisfactory but I will be very careful to avoid similar situations and loosing my number for 10 days.",1
With id mobile being on the 3 network I expected great coverage but I experience network and call drop outs quite regularly!I left O2 for similar reasons and may try another provider in the future.,1
Can’t get data in cities. Even when I have a 4g signal,1
Unfortunately I can't get roaming access in Canada,1
Found it hard to talk to someone regarding sim not working in a new phone  nowhere on app to contact,1
The data signal keeps dropping the data is also slow. It doesn't matter my location either. There is NO support regarding this problem. Which is frustratingly annoying.Please sort it out with the 3 network.,1
Coverage isn't greatNo tube coverage,1
Network quality is poor. Too much call drop.,1
On a trip to France last week my SIM stopped working. Unable to access my ID account to resolve the problem as I could not receive code you were texting me.,1
Using 3 means that I am very restricted in the data I can use it is very limited,1
"Not able to contact anybody who could help me ,keeps saying login details are wrong,just left in limbo ???Update,iD reached out and after explaining the issue it was quickly resolved via a discussion on X which is not ideal but at least it was resolved.",1
the contract price is fine.  but as for international roaming the prices are dreadful with yourselves. Good job I disabled my sim card and just used hotel wifi,1
"I have 3 accounts, mine and 2 other family members. Find no flex in creating one account and sharing rollover data...",1
Don't get internet in some areas and don't get free data roaming on holiday in turkey.. see better deals on website than I am on no customer service to call tried once to change to a different contract and ended up having 2 contracts going should be help for the elderly it's hard to try and change to better contract,1
The problem i have with  ID Mobile is you can't contact or speak to anyone  +the app is absolutely ridiculous to navigate i have been with you for a long time now +normally have to learn to solve any problems or anything that's wrong myself  or ask friends i am currently trying  to cancel  my last contract as I have already started  another one with you I will probably have to stop at the bank then you will contact  me you really need some customer service training in place,1
Getting charge for premium taxis at that I did not make,1
All is ok with the service . One thing that’s not good is I can’t get a signal in my home which is frustrating so I have to use WhatsApp.,1
"I find it odd and very alarming in this day and age, that despite having service indicated on my phone 2,3,4 bars of 4g and unable to connect to the network for a simple phone call. Let alone data for sat nav or other connectivity. Very poor",1
"Network signal, poor signal service at Fenchurch st station, Cheshire area Rayleigh",1
Like the price and all things relating to the phone.I'm in a complete muddle about viewing the account online. Never have been able to work it out.,1
"Recently I have found there is a distinct drop in coverage, phone shows 4g but doesn’t work, if I find 3G nearby it works better",1
Price fir tariff is great. But signal is poor. I only ever have 2 bars or less,1
"Having recently moved to ID Ive had no problems until today, when my service has dropped out and I am unable to make calls.  Ive checked and there are no service issues in my area and my phone is compatible. Ive turned flight mode of & on, turned the handset off & on and still no joy.Trying to get assistance is a total headache. The chatbot system is useless. Ive tried to speak to a person but thats not even loading! Very poor service levels, ID.** Updated review to 3* as issue now resolved. Useful for customers to know that messaging via facebook messenger illicits a human response. **",1
No service in Denmark or in Norway and week signal in my area plus the app is difficult to access now,1
Reception was terrible while at Lindisfarne festival last weekend.Zero reception while friends had full 5gNetwork should be improved in rural areas.All good in towns and cities and good value.Thanks,1
Poor signal and unable to make calls or calls drop. Seems to be going worse. Recently been abroad and worked great both internet & mobile calls. Shame UK is not the same,1
Can’t get hold of you,1
Very poor mobile coverage in many area around the uk.,1
"The basic package is ok the price is good,the big problem is the three network the signal keeps going off , I've been with ID almost a year and have lost almost seven weeks of phone use , twice it was off over two weeks solid and never a apology from ID bad very bad customer relations.",1
Poor signal in an area where signal strength is supposed to be strong.,1
Average 4 and 5G very slow,1
Keeping my informed,1
ID are a great mobile provider.The WiFi calling option which is included in their packages is invaluable. Also rolling over unused Data from one month to the next is helpful.Unfortunately the 3 network is patchy at best and occasionally hopeless in our area. It would be helpful if ID could press the 3 network to improve their coverage.,1
Signal  not very good when in the cou try side.,1
I find it very odd that in a few shops and buildings I get very limited service. I'm aware that sometimes it's down to the construction of these places but surely your service should be strong enough to still give a reasonable connection without cutting out? Perhaps I need to find a more reliable provider?,1
Decent phone and data service. Incredible value for money but customer service isn't great at all. Upgrading or switching to iD can be very painful. Billing/app also not good.,1
"When out of the uk the coverage is terrible, thought it was just my phone that was the issue but my wife is with ID also and we both had major trouble using our devices abroad but friends on other networks worked fine, major issue for us, seriously considering changing supplier",1
"One Issue. When I'm at home, the signal strength is so poor, It's almost impossible to carry out a voice call. I've tried connecting to the home network, but the signal is still ""dropping out"" all the time. All other solutions have also failed. I'm guessing the fault lies with the host network, which I believe to be Three, otherwise I would have given a much lower rating.No other issues.",1
The service is good except in BH6 4 area of Bournemouth. Cannot make receive calls unless you find hot spots.Also we cannot use ID aims in the United States when on holiday which is not good if we have Banking/cards issue as the Bank know our normal phone numbers if we are in trouble and need to call UK.,1
"Not able to speak to anyone,called a few times, says go to website",1
Reception out of home is average at best.,1
The contract price is great but the reception on 3 mobile is patchy.,1
Poor app that requires re login every time.,1
"The billing, charges and app use are fine however the poor connection in our area is the concern.",1
I dont like that it is difficult to speak to someone if you need help,1
Dont always have network!,1
Good price and a good reliable service,1
What I dislike is that you are unable to talk to someone over the phone.And could do more to help with traveling to non EU countries like USA and Canada.,1
Cheap contract which helps in the current climate. I travel alot with work and can't get connection alot of the time,1
You appear to make better offers to new customers - that you never put to existing customers.,1
"Signal coverage poor in some parts, lagging video/film using data",1
"The first thing that appears in the app on home screen should be your current data and minutes plan with allowances remaining + Current monthly plan costs and Bill Capping  - not an advert to upgrade.Advert could be replaced by a question/ link buttons for Upgrade options eg ""Need more data?"" or ""Need more Minutes?"" or ""Need new phone?"" .Should also be a link to costs for non inclusive charges for roaming - it will win you customers if you're honest and up front.And why not also sell unlocked phones outright ie not just as part of a contracted bundle?",1
"Great price, but I seem increasingly unable to get a signal when I'm out and about, which is a big nuisance factor.",1
"The phone service & ease of changing contracts is fine, but I don't like the fact that it appears impossible to speak to someone in person if there is a slightly more complicated issue. Yes, there is the live chat function, but those features are not, in my experience, as satisfactory as being able to actually talk to someone.",1
Can't complain about the price or the coverage. It's the customer service that just have no idea which is a shame and laughable.,1
Quite a cheap but poor coverage in my part of the UK and very expensive to use abroad. I purchased a second e-sim to use abroad to avoid ID’d high roaming charges.,1
Great valueGreat signalGreat appCustomer service?….. non existent!,1
Coverage where I live is very poor despite the map saying it should be good and there is nowhere to report it as a problem,1
"The coverage leaves a little to be desired...My wife and I both have the same iPhones - but with different carriers. We can be in the same location, but she gets reception while I, with ID, don't.Yes, they are cheaper - but the cost reduction has to be considered against having proper coverage.",1
Great price per month but not a great coverage where I live.,1
Service seems very intermittent and unreliable.,1
Mostly very good however in the Lake District and Yorkshire dales signal is very poor to non existent,1
Signal patchy,1
Since the software upgrade I was unable to log on to my account for months.  It has been resolved now but so frustrating.  The s/w upgrade was ill thought thru which did a lot of damage.  Going forward if there are no further issues I shall upgrade my review.. Thx,1
My bill was £9.14. it should be 7. Don't know what I did wrong,1
Not being able to speak to someone directly after signing upProblems when roaming in EU,1
"I can't use my phone to make calls from my own house. Neither can my wife (also an ID mobile customer). We have searched your website to try and find out how to report this, but we just get directed to your 'User Forum'. I'm not prepared to spend hours trawling through incorrect drivel to try and sort this - far more likely to change provider tbh...",1
The quality of coverage is not great. My phone is always the first to lose network. But the service is reliable in every other way. The app works and billing is fine,1
"The service is OK. However, it is unfair that customers have to pay more for a IDmobile plan directly when Mobiles.co.uk offers cashback for the same plan.Why not reward loyal customers!Ps: the IDmobile plan was compared on the same day, only a few minutes apart.",1
"Could not access phone options in Albania, Macedonia and Kosovo.",1
"Easy plans and payments. Bit stingy at 8gb/£6, but it is - what it is.",1
A lot of areas where is bad signal or no signal at all,1
Generally very good and competitive. Unhappy that existing customers don’t get same offers as new customers when looking at upgrading phone or plan,1
"ID are great for a low cost plan with rollover, WiFi calling and roaming. However, if you want to change your handset, they will not allow you to use 3rd party offers, they will only allow you to keep your number if you upgrade with them (usually at a higher price).",1
"I have had a constant battle with iD about why I can't send texts or Whatsapps to 4 or 5 digit numbers such as BBC Sport, TfL, Transport Police etc and I can't attach images to texts. When I complain iD ask me for streams of info about the messages that won't send, then either tell me it's been sorted (when it hasn't) or fail to reply. When I chase it up, they again ask me for stacks of info about the texts. I have given up, which I suspect was what they hoped I'd do. iD is cheap to use but you get what you pay for. I will return to EE. Oh, and reception on iD is awful, even in London. No signal (when my wife is connected to EE) or slow.iD have just replied to the above with the predictable reply they always send. ""Switch on premium setting"" - it is on! ""Change premium cap"" - it is already set to a high level.id's answers are scripted, not tailored for individual customer needs and lazy.",1
"The signal in the UK is hit and miss - just spent a week in the Malverns with minimal signal - so bad, I had to connect with local Wi-Fi or use my wife’s Tesco mobile to piggy-back just to check emails.  Similar issues when roaming in EU for 2 months - poor signal, no roaming in Switzerland.  Thankfully wife’s Tesco mobile saved the day yet again.",1
I don't think it is simple enough for the older person,1
The sim only tariff I'm on used to be a very good deal.Other company's are offering much better deals now.,1
The lack of USA roaming is an issue they have 50 Countries but not USA. I rang to see if there was a bolt on package and there is not. The operator did offer my PAC code to switch providers...did not feel valued,1
Coverage for data services seems not to be as good as other monile operators. My wife is with vodafone and her data services usually work in locations when my ID phone doesn't work.,1
The prices are great but the coverage lets it down. I know it's supposed to work off a bigger network but many times I have poor signal. Rarely do I get 5G and it's a new Google pixel phone,1
I like it when you tell me when my service is nearly up but you say check the app but I don’t know where the app is so I can’t check it,1
Data is to expensive,1
Price is great. Amount of data great. But coverage seems to be getting worse. Sat in the same place I used to get 5g I occasionally get 4g or even H. When abroad it seems to always automatically connect to the worse option. Whilst the wife's O2 is regularly 5g abroad. You can then manually change it.,1
You guys don’t support eSIM with Apple Watch and this is frustrating as I have Apple Watch that I would like to use without my phone on me.,1
I only get 3g at my home address,1
"I have no problem with my phone, samsung24 ultra when I'm out and about, however, when I'm in my home I have very little signal although my daughter who has an apple, and is on id, never has a problem wherever she is in the house",1
I'm not into working for others who's job it is anyway,1
"As usual, new customers get what was promised. I mean, after some time your internet speeds go down to unbearable. And in this world of today, the internet speed is what matters most. I’m waiting for Black Friday offers from other providers. ID has proven untrustworthy to me. Cheap but sh____.[edit]My residence area is 5G and low speeds have been registered for months. OUTSIDE. Anyway, it doesn’t quite matter if it’s 3, 4 or 5G technology. Speeds are linked to one of those technologies but don’t automatically guarantee the speed. So sorry, Tyler, but the below reply is of little value to me.",1
"Great value for money EXCEPT that I find in busy places my data speed grinds to a halt, even with four or five bars of phone signal! This happens consistently in a few places but not others, so not being able to use my phone just because I've gone somewhere in particular gets a black mark from me, especially given that somewhere else for example, I can have no issues at all? Who knows.",1
Signal in my area is NOT as good as stated. If it wasn't for wifi calling I'd move contracts to be honest. This comment refers only to the signal. The price of the tariff and its rolling data is excellent value!,1
It might be my phone or some other reason but I find the signal coverage could be a lot better as there are quite a few places where my phone loses contact with the outside world,1
Happy with most things 4g is very poor most of the time,1
I have been with this provider for a long time. Its just gotten unbelievable terrible. You can't get into your account online anymore as keeps coming up errors. The customer support even though talking to real people have confusing answers. I talked to 4 different customer support on the same day and got different information for the same question by all 4 people. Never got my questions answered. I'm leaving this after about 6 years. It used to be good and reasonable now its just a frustrating joke! I'd definitely find a better provider that can actually help and not have to guess what the support is talking about. I've had to ask for a PAC code so I can use the same number.,1
I love the price but my signal for both mobile WiFi and calls has been poorer over recent months.,1
I have been having problems making calls from my mobile and when abroad had no internet connection at all .Finding it really hard to contact anyone to resolve this,1
I would like to discuss about a new phone but I want to do so with an English speaking person,1
My phone calls cut out if I move from room to room. WhatsApp phone call never last more than a couple of minutes before I am cut off,1
"Very good in UK and easy to change details, plan, etc., on the app. Marked down as having set up roaming and international well in advance, was not able to use service (send/receive texts, make calls), when overseas.",1
Better coverage in parts of Glasgow please.,1
Struggle with customer support. Unable to access account on the web for about a month with no updates.,1
"There are a lot of areas where we don't have reception it is very bad as I can't make important phone calls, text or have access to data. I need this for work. you guys have to sort this out ASAP",1
"The network is great. I have no issues with coverage. The price is good.However, I recently had to try to contact you and although the chat can be useful, it didn't solve my issue. I actually needed to speak to someone.  That is my only criticism",1
Poor reception and coverage for my area. Phone calls and signal keep dropping off.,1
Coverage isn't as good as expected,1
"Hi - When I am abroad, I can not make any calls? Is there something I should be doing? Whats app works ok",1
ID mobile Signal quality has got progressively worse to the point of thinking about a change of provider.It was ok when I first joined Id mobile but now spend most of my time trying to get a signal. Which is a shame because id  mobile is a great company apart from that. Love the data rollovers and the price is amazing,1
Great price but signal isn’t always great . Bought to take away as an extra but often can’t use .,1
Convoluted savings plans that rely on people who can't be bothered to jump through the hoops,1
"Well been happy until its time to actually speak about changing my contract to a sim only . I am out of contract . I have been speaking to someone for obver an hour for a simple request . It sounded like a robot as they asked the same questions over and over . I asked a simple question , After almost an hour they said i will put you through to sales team , Then waited over 20 minutes for no one to be there . SO Frustrating to do a simple task . And trying to find the correct way on the app is impossible",1
I joined I’d mobile because of the free roaming. Very good in Europe but I was charged extraordinary amount for my time in the USA.,1
"Overall the service is good, only tjing can comment on as of late the reception has not been as good, not sure as to why? But it does start customers looking at other avenues, as this is the main service we require a 'reception anywhere' where possible!",1
The phone service (Three) is absolutely terrible. I keep losing calls and getting cut off. I wish I had been informed about this prior to my contract.,1
"Not the best coverage, can be hit and miss.  But low cost.",1
"Have been a customer for over 6 years now on a rolling 31 day contract so that I can change level of data from month to month, as a when required, very useful as well as data rollover. Sadly, over the last year or so,  I've noticed that signal coverage in some areas isn't what it used to be, shame really as I'm very happy with ID Mobile overall.",1
"I’m not sure if I can give you my receipt experience as I seldom use the phone as it doesn’t work indoors, James Bevan",1
"Existing customer upgrade offers not good compared to those offered to new customers, poor signal coverage especially out of town, main plus point is that it is cheap and offers EU roaming",1
ont good service. to mach problems. I don't like it.,1
Contacted you sat about an issue and was told it would be sorted within 24hrs 4days later not sorted,1
"Not easy to reach live chat, constantly referred to community.i pay id for a service not other users",1
"The service overall is pretty good. Sometimes though, the signal strength in my area is poor and I have to go upstairs to get a slightly stronger signal in order to make a call. Occasionally a call inexplicably drops out. Generally data availability is good but often slow.",1
"ID Mobile has a tremendous price advantage over its competitors. That comes with some downside however.....the reception is sometimes flaky (inconsistent) and in some areas within central London there is consistently no signal (in spite of trying at 'off peak' times as well as peak.) Right now I have problems using the internet and also the mobile phone...and service often drops out particularly in late-mornings. Also, don't expect realistic help, beyond the usual glossy patting-ourselves-on-the-back missives.....Since, sadly, the modern way is for companies to treat cutomers with little repect, at least ID Mobile is no worse than the rest.So if you want to pay very little, and have only basic needs, then they would be perfect!",1
"When in France recently I go no network connection, I contacted your chat line and it took over 2 hours to sort the problem out!",1
"The plus points, the price & customer service, both are first class! Now the negatives, sadly the reception in certains areas is poor and the voicemail on an iPhone does not work so you have to call the voicemail number. I would advise checking on the coverage in your area before getting tied into a contract and if that is OK then it is well worth joining ID Mobile.",1
"I'm coming up to end of my current contract term and you keep sending me reminders on new phones,. As a senior citizen I'm looking to reduce my costs everywhere and will take on a SIM only contract next time. My point is that nowhere in the guff you send me does it say SIM only upgrades are only available 24 days before my contract ends. So I ordered SIM only only to find out these were extras not upgrades. They have been cancelled. At time of choosing I am now going to shop around.After seeing your reply, why, when I cancelled orders within 48 hours of placing them and been told by your chat line staff that they had been 'returned and cancelled', and that any payment instructions would also be automatically cancelled, are you still writing to me to tell me that the direct debit is due to start. I have already informed my bank to cancel. You need to teach your staff how to cancel properly. Please note this all relates to new orders placed in July, not my existing deal due to finish around October.",1
"Signup was easy and the sim turned up quickly. Uses the Three network in the UK so coverage is decent. App allows you to accurately track costs and data usage. Reason for 3 stars is due to terrible coverage overseas. Was not able to get any signal, even in big towns and cities in Europe",1
Although I was due an upgrade I only did so as I was told the screen was cracked in fact it was the screen saver not the phone.,1
I want to see if you have a better deal but unable to speak with anyone and other network offers better deals so going to move,1
"Despite wanting to notify ID that I wanted to cancel my contract in order to ensure I didn't continue paying for my phone having paid the 24 monthly repayments this month, the person on 'chat' incorrectly insisted I had to wait until the day after the 2 year contract date. My contract reflected 24 days before the end date, but she argued that was incorrect!",1
Not happy with not having any internet in Mk2 Pinewood Drive area.,1
"ID mobile used to be one of the best value SIM only deals on the market but they seemed to have now fallen behind a bit in the value for money stakes with a lot of newcomers to the market offering better deals.I also have not been overly impressed by the coverage, while it seems fine in larger cities out in the countryside the coverage is 'patchy' They use the three network. My partner who uses another network did not lose signal on their phone on any of these occasions. I've also had issues at some places where you wouldn't expect such as some of the areas in/around Heathrow airport with no signal.Finally although they include free roaming across the EU watch out for countries that are not in the EU (but still in Europe) as they are not included. A good example being Switzerland which many other companies include in their free roaming but ID mobile does not.",1
"impossible to get any info, any support, anything, from anyone at ID Mobile once the [VERY COST EFFECTIVE] contract is on. On the other hand, would you wish to purchase more / buy more / upgrade, they are very efficiently responding.",1
"I hate not able to speak to someone on the phone when you have a problem, or able to ask for some assistance",1
I have found it impossible to link my 4 ID mobile accounts. so really very frustrating.,1
Good value for money but network coverage can be patchy (lots of dead areas even in major cities),1
No signal in my area around my house and streets.Need to drive 5 minutes till I get a signal.,1
I constantly get no network available for the phone but 4g ok,1
I don’t like the fact that I can’t speak to a real person when I’m dealing with ID mobile. I don’t want to chat to somebody in a group chat,1
We find it difficult to get a signal in most places and a very week signal at home.,1
"I seem to be living in, and visiting far too many places where I either have a minimal signal or even none!This is not a date issue, it’s a lot of the time.Too rural in Lincolnshire I guess?",1
Cheap and cheerful,1
"Back in April we lost all service for 5 days. When I complained I was informed that work was being carried out as part of the 3G switch off. Since then we have never had ""full"" signal coverage within the Town that I live in. Very disappointed with the outcome. Prior to the work I  always had 4 bars on the phone signal strength, now it is often only 2. Hardly an improvement in service.",1
Problems with website took long time to sort out.when I download statements & try to print them they come out virtually blank,1
We use Sim only to run Wifi on board a narrow Boat. The signal does deteriate and wifi is lost.Coverage is the problem.,1
I live in Norfolk and I quite often do not get a very good signal and sometimes my calls keep breaking up which is very frustrating as I haven't got a land line,1
Confusing and difficult to get my revised package. You cannot have a quick conversation with a human to make sense of it.But...all in all happy with iD.,1
"OK service provider, about the same as most - rarely offers good alternatives",1
"On Saturday 13th July all day and early Sunday morning, 14th July, I had no signal so I could neither make or receive a phone call. This has happened before on a number of occasions.",1
I could not get my old phone removed as it's in my husbands name.,1
"Recently switched from O2 to ID, had ended sim contract and ID offering great price- received my sim and it wouldn't work at all- customer service not helpful until the 3rd time when the agent sent me and ESIM and now it seems to be working alot better. Great app-able to monitor use and amazing price saving me 10 a month from my old provider! Would have given more stars if the switch over had of been straight forward",1
Price good.Choice of packages goodService/signal not so good very variableCould not use data abroadHelp menus not very helpful,1
"It appears almost impossible to talk to a real person! Where has the customer service gone? I am a non tech person and find your service, to be polite, not very good.",1
Was difficult  to get thru at 1st but better mow,1
"ID Mobile is very good. The problem lies in the network provider it uses, Three! I live in Wilmslow and use my mobile for work. I have never had a problem with the other network providers I have used in the past (O2 and Vodafone). However, the coverage/call quality on Three is little short of appalling and only 4G at most is available! Beware!!",1
Still cannot login to online account,1
I had a phone a,1
Can't make calls in house and texting difficult too,1
"Id mobile is cheaper than most,offers very much the same as other networks,only draw back is it uses 3 network who claim a massive coverage but I find it a below average service,most days I only get 1 bar,but as they say you get what you pay for",1
The upgrades offered aren't always available.,1
I like the roaming charges.Some of extra charges eg certain numbers (033)do not agree with.Non internet help/service is poor. not suitable for someone like me (pensioner/non technology savvy)Hardly ever see written bills records of use/charges.,1
Have been with iD for 4 years now and not had an issue with them until just having purchased a new phone. At no time was I informed that there was no way I could keep my old number as it was deemed I had 2 accounts and you can't change a number from one account to another in the same company,1
OK - eventually sorted out a big problem with the account about 15 months ago - OK since then.,1
Too frequently poor signal or no signal. Not always good reception,1
Find it hard to contact you with any problems,1
Variable coverage.  No usable coverage in my area,1
"Virtually impossible to use my mobile abroad. I've had trouble in France, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cape Verde and Sri Lanka.I've coped by using whattsapp in ordercto make calls ( using the hotel wifi only) but banking is a major problem as I can't get One Time Passwords.",1
When you can get a signal it’s a great deal but the signal has been getting worse and worse in the East Riding over the last year or so.,1
"Prices are brilliant, but the signal has gotten worse over the last year. I travel all over the UK and the signal isn't really good anywhere. All the family have ID via different mobile manufacturers and none of the signals are good.",1
"It's cheap, but absolutely zero ways to speak to anyone.Get what you pay for I guess",1
"I would like to have kept my old plan, but bought a new phone.  But I was told this plan would be better.  Not really, my last plan had 100gb of data which I could roll over any unused allowance and add to the new monthly allowanceI which could be used in full when travelling in Europe.  My allowance now is capped at 30gb in Europe on the unlimited data plan. Very disappointed with advice.",1
I used to receive monthly statements. I haven’t for quite some time. The phone signal is weak (1 bar outside) and connection to many top sites including yours can only be accessed via WiFi. I feel phone/mobile data suppliers are not doing their job effectively in putting pressure on mast owners to keep their infrastructure efficient enough for consumers to use reliably. Bar these issues you would have had a higher star rating.,1
Sometimes don't get a very good reception on some phone calls,1
Problem with the national test not coming through and sometimes texts sticking in the ether.,1
"First of all, I’ve had excellent coverage and service with ID mobile as my provider, so there’s nothing but praise for that, but the customer service is SO difficult. You get wildly inconsistent information from one person to the next and it can take hours to solve a simple problem! I’m trying to end my contract early and I’ve been given a range of different costs and different information from one person to the next. How can they all differ so much?? I wouldn’t mind but I’m not even leaving ID, I just want to move to a rolling contract and they make it stupidly difficult to do so!",1
Voice calls and internet access whilst out and about (in the UK and Europe) are very poor or impossible without logging onto someone elses’s wifi.,1
"Was VERY happy with original deal,Until I got a second sim for my daughter who ported her number and now I cannot see, amend or add to my account for billing / maintenance.It works and they are taking the payment   BUT...Automated help system is NAFF,Unable to get real HELP..... FROM A PERSON !!!!*** finally sorted the issue after talking to a person (family member) but still took ages and few attempts, Other than the support being fully automated the sim service is good ****",1
Good value but often poor connection when out and about. Not able to use on London Underground 😞,1
No warm body to talk to when you have a problem.,1
Not having free roaming in Australia.,1
Can’t use the app,1
Very difficult to get to speak to a real person. Thinking of changing.,1
"I’ve no problems, haven’t had to phone for years,So hard to comment on anything,",1
Took a long time to sort out a problem I had with my phone. The agents in Curry’s where I was sent one of them was useless. Fault finally passed onto tech team who sorted it straight away. Why that couldn’t have been done initially is a mystery,1
"When I tried to contact you via telephone for an urgent matter, no human to speak to. This is a major downfall of this Company. Not very good customer service.",1
It's my personal opinion that the coverage is not wonderful and several interruptions are very annoying.Would definately have to consider a different provider when contract ends unless of course things improve,1
"I inadvertently changed the agreement on one of my mobiles and was unable to revert to its original agreement. I tried emailing iD Mobile but got no response. It was not a lot more money, but I was happy with the existing deal. I accept it was my error in making the change, but would have liked the opportunity to cancel. My email to iD Mobile which was not answered did request cancelling the order.",1
We're I live is very bad phone coverage can be on the phone and it cuts out all the time,1
Coverage not great. Sometimes only 3g in our area.,1
Good - price for low use phoneBad - was told I would be able to see both phones on my account when I got an additional sim but seems you have to access account by app now.  As neither phone is in my possession I am stumped.Very bad - sim doesn't work in old Doro phones.  This wasn't clear before I got it so useless for the elderly relatives phone I'd bought it for.,1
"Good competitive price with lots of useful regular information sent. However, roaming do not include all EU countries, like other mobile networks. Also, minimal reception in some towns just 20 miles from London.",1
Service and signal has been really patchy lately. Calls keep getting dropped or people can't hear me. It's really frustrating !,1
A few days ago our phone stopped being to make or receive calls.  Nothing on the website covers this!  Luckily we have a local Carphone Warehouse.  There are telephone numbers online for there but they do not work.  We went there and member of staff seems to have fixed the problem.Your website and Chat are pathetic!,1
That all off your date you have left does not carry  over,1
New ZealandIt would be useful if roaming applied to other destinations other than EU,1
I was told to contact them to activate my replacement SIM.  They only provide online chat support and often don't understand your difficulty/question.  I was told I would need to go on their app to complete the activation but every time i entered info and clicked on 'continue' a box popped up 'oops something went wrong'.  Been trying now for over an hour.  Went back on live chat and they didn't understand my problem.  In the end I said 'I want to speak to someone'.  I'm in a 45 minute queue now.  When I did finally get to chat with someone and they were struggling to resolve the issue they cut me off. Very very frustrating so I will change providers when my contract ends.,1
I’m very disappointed that when I recently had a short break in Cornwall I had no signal whatsoever. Vodaphone is the only way in Cornwall. What happened to mast sharing??,1
I have been over paying for a long time and have had no replies to my inquiries.Have sent many letters to you over the past 12 months.Louise,1
"I’m afraid after twenty years with another companies network I chose to move because of an offer, it seems this was a mistake, the reception from I.d. is very poor in the area I’m in at the moment which is LA 6 1AD and I spend half of the year here, I have three contracts with I.d. and unless coverage improves I shall be moving on when the contracts end.",1
I have 2 different sim only deals with you one for myself and one for my dad. Sadly my father has passed away and I cannot contact you to cancel his plan.I can't just cancel the direct debit either as I don't know which one is linked to dad's and which is mine.It's totally impossible to contact you by live chat or any other way.This disappoints me. The plan us excellent and does everything I ask for but when there's a problem I just can't get it sorted,1
The one and only concern about ID is that the monthly charge goes up with inflation each year.,1
"Your ‘survey’ people are hopeless. Tried 3x different but valid email addresses to enter the prize draw. All were rejected. Had to choose ‘no’ to entering. You need to be more careful who you get to set these surveys. Very poor, ID. Very poor.",1
I needed to change my email addressIt proved to be almost impossible  very frustrating  i gave up so many times i i even went to a currys store to see if they could help but no they couldnt help!!! All new codes were sent to old emailBring back a person to talk too it would have been sorted in 5 minutes,1
Often I cannot use the phone outside as mobile data not working,1
"It’s alright  now , Thank you, I’m over it!   C.",1
I travel to North Yorkshire quite frequently to a caravan park-and my service is terrible. I can text or call first thing in morning and late at night and I have no reception in between them times. If I needed help I wouldn’t be able to reach anyone. We don’t have Wi-Fi but my mobile data can’t be used.when I was using a different network this didn’t happen. At home in the north east I have no issues with data,1
do not get good signal my old phone was better than the one i have now,1
Took out the contract with a new phone and network reception has been good. Customer service good as well but only three stars because you have to record your own message you can’t use a pre recorded version like most networks. As a small business owner I prefer a pre recorded one,1
"Overall, it's a great price and saving me a fortune that O2 were taking feom me each month, just when I researched coverage, I was assured I'd have 100% coverage where I live, but very often I have nothing, which is quite frustrating as I rely on it for everything. But, that said they're a really good set up and easy to use",1
Day to day service okay BUT impossible to log in to the account,1
Service in the U.K. is excellent but I’m very disappointed that the company can’t offer a fixed price package for our trip to the USA.,1
I experience too many problems with id mobile.,1
Everytime we go on holiday to Isle of Wight I can't use it. No signal or its very weak.,1
the network coverage is poor but the price is low,1
"There is no physical person to speak to, just ai bots... that is not good for a phone company when people have a problem.",1
Lack of people contact. Inflation costs on  phones that have not been subject to cost increase for ID. Excuse to charge more than agreed priceCURE - leave ID at end of this contract,1
"I have been with ID Mobile for a number of years, very happy except for the very miserable experience using their live chat service to try and resolve an issue. Customer Service  is now 100% online , my chat wait time was tedious and difficult to engage with, the advice given was incomplete.",1
I was happy with O2 until Currys moved me to ID Mobile.,1
"Service was good whilst on holiday recently to Portugal. Signal quite good in Portugal. NOT GOOD where we live in Middlewich, Cheshire.",1
Disappointed in coverage especially at home.,1
I canceled  my contract and paid my bills via direct debit today a received a final demand saying i owed£27.18  i went online thinking this was my final bill to pay it and an automated voice saying i owe nothinggoodbye and hung up.What's going on with them ?.,1
"It's ok, just a lot of dead spots where the is literally no signal at all. Which is bit of a concern having medical issues",1
"Frustrated that I cannot access my account online. I have changed my password 4 times to no avail ,",1
My signal is awful has been for a few weeks now. Can't Google anything as it times it's self out. It used to be good so don't know what's going on. But I love the cost of my plan. Any data I don't use gets carried on so you always get what you pay for,1
"Cannot get online abroad; it’s not my phone because I didn’t have this problem with EE, and have used your advice for phone settings, but it makes no difference. Otherwise, great service but sorry, because of the overseas issue, you’ll be losing my custom.",1
Can't get very signal. Was told you would send me a new sim card but never received one,1
I would have given five stars except for the fact that the app doesn't seem to work.Thanks for your reply - sounds like I need to re-register for the new app. But the app won't let me re-register only option is to sign in and when I do that it says something went wrong....,1
"iD Mobile offers basically everything you'd want. EU Roaming, WiFi Calling and good Customer Support for great prices.The problem for me however is the Three network they're running on. When connected, 5G can easily reach speeds up to 500 or even 1000Mpbs, but in Central London there are many spots where there is no connection of the network is too congested. Your phone might show 4G+ of 5G, but you won't actually have any internet.For me it's more important to have a reliable connection than insane speeds, so for this reason alone I switched to O2",1
"Hello, I have a sim from you for over a year. I am no longer in contact, but I stayed  because you have a very low subscription price and because I have no problems in roaming. But the signal is weak most of the time, often if I don't have wifi I can't use the internet at all. That's why I have another phone on another network so I can use it when I don't have signal from you.",1
Was very satisfied until trying to register onto the new app. That’s why the 3stars. But for the hassle involved you’d have rated highly. Don’t understand why existing customers information wasn’t moved across by I’d.,1
Not easy to speak to anyone is my only issue,1
"I don't always have a good signal, therefore I can't always gain access to open my apps",1
Zero reception at my home initially took weeks to sort it out. Now improved.,1
The signal isn't great on the outskirts of Durham.,1
Very intermittent signal around Carmarthen,1
"The price is good, but where I live LN11 7 the signal level is low and the Internet speed is low 1-2Mbps. My wife has Talk Talk service and get 20-24 Mbs.",1
"The only issue I have is that I quite often have no, or a weak signal compared to my last provider.Otherwise fine.",1
"The set up of account, app and communication is good.  The most annoying and infuriating thing is billing.  If you DD is missed they cancel it - does that makes sense to me no.  Secondly your phone is cut off and blocked after 2 days..  So this is where it is so infuriating because you can't make a payment as a result!!  online because you can't authenticate it with your banking app because you're blocked, you can't pay with the app because you're blocked, and you can't pay by calling 7777 as you still need to approve the payment via the banking app which won't open! You then can't transfer banking funds as you are blocked! I mainly use apps for banking.  I spent literally a couple hours of my day sorting it out.  I get my payment was late hands up but what if you were sick or something two days is just too soon and for this reason I don't think I want to renew my contract again. Apart from that coverage etc is good.  Plan went up in price a few pounds too after one year in.",1
Major problem receiving security codes from bank.  Had to change to landline.  It's really a pity as most everything else is fine.,1
On a whole I find ID fine to use. My big problem is the new Website. Not easy to use to find information about account and contract details. It's just aw well that people working in their stores understand and are very helpful. No idea why they changed the old site which was easy to use. If it ain't broken don't fix it.,1
"International data does not work,  despite being online with a customer service agent for half an hour or more before going to Montenegro,  the data did not work- I was assured repeatedly it would - had to buy an International E sim while out there, very disappointed",1
Price great but poor mobile service in my area,1
no email contact. you claim 24/7 support but only through automated,1
"I gave 3 stars because I often have a problem getting a signal.This means that phone calls sometimes drop out, so whilst I like the phone, I cannot rely on the service.",1
Often have trouble getting a strong signal. Can be slow.Good value. Good service on the app.,1
"Service and value is fine. Unable to access the app, so unable to apply any control. Inability to speak to an agent, sucks.",1
It is an inexpensive contact. However I don't seem to get the data coverage I did with Vodaphone previously.,1
Good price ok service,1
"I've rated 3 stars for the simple reason of the terrible signal I'm receiving, it's not just where I live as it's the same everywhere I go, a few of my friends are on ID and they too are having the same issueI believe its down to 3 mobile services as ID use their signal, 3 have always been a dinosaur in the mobile connection world and probably nothing will ever changeAfter being with ID for a few years, I'm now considering switching over to another provider",1
"Signal very poor. Told I can't be heard at times or signal is breaking up, when I'm in my own house. Never had such issues when I was with Vodafone. Also get a message telling me I have reached my data limit when I have LOADS left. However, tied into iD contract. Couldn't really recommend iD due to the issues I have. Happy to have feedback or support from iD.",1
Cos it so hard to chat to real person without having to jump though task to get the chat to real person. Your webpage is tearing as you try to find support to chat to real person no great overall,1
It would be nice to actually see what you have used in your app ...if it's there I cannot see it ..ie if I've used 25gb of my data allowance I want to see it,1
Sometimes in London in Square Mile forced onto 3G network.No signal in London Bridge station.Roaming is very slow to connect and lose signal often.Very limited 5G,1
Cheap contracts. You cant speak to anyone on the phone though so be prepared to wait for absolutely ages for responses on their live chat (I'm currently speaking to someone on the live chat...there's a min of a 5min wait between each answer. Painfully slow).,1
"Some of the best prices tariffs available, haven’t seen anything as competitive although I do experience more dropped signal than my previous provider.",1
"Since upgrading I am unable to access my account, and unable to use the app.Also the signal has deteriorated, but that may be since G3 has been switched off? I don't know...Prior to the upgrade I would have given 5 stars.",1
"I hate the new ID app! The old one allowed me to add a ""just in case""  ""shock-proof"" £5 margin to my monthly bill.  Then If I made calls to abroad or to premium rate numbers  or used extra data  then it would be taken out of the 5 pound. Now I can only pre-pay for extra data ( which I may not use) or extra minutes ( which again I may not use). And I will get charged  even if I don't use the extra data/minutes.Badly done ID!And I hope your cover abroad has improved. Last time I was abroad even after calling ID I could not make any calls . I never had that problem with Vodafone.",1
I would like to contact you by telephone - not online - I recently tried to change my phone and I was unable to go further with it as curry’s said my mobile no didn’t match your records - I wanted to speak to a person not via online,1
"It works ok so far use in my IPad while roaming.Tried today to login  get to success, then it asks for phone number etc won’t accept it and goes back to square one.Tried help not very helpful! Given up",1
The value for money is great as well as the coverage. My one gripe however is with billing. It seems like they take the money for the billing whenever they like as long as it’s ‘around’ a certain date which isn’t helpful when people have other bills to pay and money going out. Also the live customer service chat is awful as you have to talk to a robot before you can get through to a person and the chatbot never seems to grasp the issue at hand.,1
Better Network,1
"Pretty good, apart from giving my Pac request that I did not ask for and attempted to get in my bank account",1
Had a lot of problems getting on the app,1
Not great coverage,1
I have been really pleased with ID mobile buy using the phone/Internet internationally could definitely be better. There isn't even an option to use the phone when we've been in the USA and Canada.  We'd be happy to buy US usage but they don't offer that.Also trying to get in touch with anyone is impossible. Given up many times.It's good value for money but there are downsidesWe would look to move when we have the time to investigate alternatives.,1
The actual product from ID Mobile is very good. They fell down on customer service when the only option was to ask an online forum of customers. I still believe after chasing 6 referral bonus payments that never turned up without extensive chasing  that they offer this dangled carrot and deliberately make it difficult to claim so you give up,1
I’m very pleased with how you handled things in the lock down situation bu I have just finished a holiday in Australia and needed to use my phone for medical purposes and couldn’t every time I did I had a text telling me the cost so I am can’t understand why you don’t do Roming,1
Good value in UK and Europe.Hopeless in India.  I’d have happily paid a daily rate such as Vodafone do.,1
Can’t get the updated app to work. Frequently there is no signal.,1
"Fantastic Price, but unfortunately the signal is not the best in a lot of areas. Hence my new mobile is slower on the internet than my friends and I don’t always get a reception too. That is the only downside of using ID mobile and I am looking at changing to a stronger more reliable signal for my area.",1
Improve communication and support customers who have not been fully updated with changes in the app,1
Coverage is poor compared to other networks,1
"iD Mobile piggybacks on the 3 network. When the services is good, it's very good. Too often, however, when it's poor, it's very poor. Poor signal and slow speeds are not uncommon.",1
Signal is not as good as they like you to believe often 1 or 2 bars only,1
Always liked ID. Still using them.  Change over a bit complicated with mixed emails.   Phone still out if stock with Curry’s.  Don’t like new app,1
I just need to change supplier data and reception is poor 😕 I kept it for the added roaming but when I recently used that was very intermittent.,1
Overall am happy with iD but when there is a problem it is frustrating that it’s so difficult to actually speak to anyone to resolve the issue. In fact it’s impossible.Also as a contract is about to end and it’s possible to upgrade it’s difficult to sort out when conflicting dates and information is given out. Annoying,1
Not a great signal but three to blame for this and need to improve.Don’t like charge for sending pictures via text. Meant to be unlimited and we are paying more for it. OK but could do better.,1
Am finding the service where I can use my phone is limited when I go out of my local area,1
Great service really good internet only reason for 3 stars is that if you got any issues you can't actually speak to a human being I lost my ild number because of this,1
When I log in it goes straight to my wife's account. I can't access my account individually,1
Very poor coverage up in the highlands of Scotland compared to my other contract with EE,1
"Price attracted me, weird mix of very basic app, 90s looking web portal and community support. Queuing to register and login ????? Whats is that about, bill you before sin arrives, PAC transfer problem ( might be my fault ) and est of 5 days for PAC transfer ( Nah mate) seems ridiculous.",1
"If I was writing my review 6 months ago, I'd give them 6 stars if I could. Never an issue, got 5g service before a lot of my friends on other providers, and always got fantastic service. Unfortunately in the last 6 months or so we've had around 3 full day outages, with very little communication by the company on sites such as Twitter, other than a generic 'bear with us'. They've also recently updated their mobile app and customer web portal, which has been a farce to say the least. High wait queue times and very limited availability at the moment. I'm still a customer and hopeful they can turn it around. I also payed off my mobile phone, but they continued to charge me for both my phone and data plan... feel a bit robbed.",1
"The new app is not as good. Before their ""upgrade"" i could add a 5 pound buffer zone which was shock-proof, in case I called a premium number or called abroad. Then it would be taken out of the £5. Now you have to pre-buy a certain number of minutes which I may end up not using . Badly done ID mobile!Also mobile coverage abroad used to be terrible. I only hope it has improved. Even though you were supposed to be able to make calls, it never worked. Let's see if it works in 2024!",1
"Sign up, the phone, price and plan are great.. but god forbid you want to use their app, customer service or view a bill.I have been with ID for around 6 months now, Contacted support on 3 occasions and each time I have had a tragic experience and just cancel the chat without any result. I have had to ask agents if they are real as they are copy and pasting badly from a script that makes no sense.I can barely use the app or website for errors, every bill I have is in symbols and Wingdins font.. I have asked support about this "" we are doing mantinence at the moment thats the issue"" ... then "" it will be fixed at some point"" .The bill to leave them for another provider varys also, some days it is higher and lower than the last.If it works, great. If you need support.. then don't bother. I want to leave.",1
The  company service is excellent. Unfortunately the coverage in YO14 is patchy with message breakup and occasional cutout. Looks like I will need another provider but sorry that this is necessary.,1
"It seems that ID Mobile have recently implemented a queueing system to access their website where you are given an estimated time when you can enter the site. For customers who want to download their invoices each month and for other general use, what a ludicrous means of saving on bandwidth, hence cost, because this is it's purpose. Most customers don't want to have to wait and they deserve better ID Mobile!",1
"Great value, but awful signal in Leeds",1
"I waited six months before writing this review as I took out a great value contract with them on a Google pixel 8. On the plus side the amount of data I get is brilliant and the phone cost was exceptional when factoring the overall price for the duration of my contract.I did carefully check the coverage checker at both my home and work location before ordering the phone but I have been disappointed with the coverage and speed of the connection. In addition I regularly drive on business and the phone does not seem to connect to a 4g or 5g signal easily, instead regularly showing no signal or basic calls. It's not a phone issues as I downloaded a separate Vodafone e sim to test a few long journeys.In summary I guess you get what you pay for, I'm happy with my Google pixel and hope the network improves or they consolidate with another network. If not I will be moving to an alternative network once my contract expires.",1
"Just started with ID mobile DATA  Works ok my iPad Tried to set up account, not easy especially when I put phone  number they sent me in their long winded process doesn’t recognise it, tried twice , so if it continues to work ok re charges etc. Will leave as is",1
"Tried to ""speek"" to someone is like pulling teeth. Why not incorperate your mid contract price hype into the start of the contract.",1
"Very good for data & wi-fi calls over i'net, not good for phone connection, Calls drop out and are difficult to hear. But low cost, so check your coverage for signal.",1
Recommend a friend. I needed to chase my voucher. My friend chased his but months later it still hasn’t been credited.Very disappointing and I won’t be recommending anyone else.,1
"Their website is horrendous, can't find anything. The chat bot is even worse.Their customer service when you eventually get to an agent is okay though, it is a redeeming feature",1
Poor reception in many areas I visit on holiday.,1
"The prices are good, but they take far too long to correct issues with their app and website. Many customers couldn't view their bills for weeks.",1
Really really really bad service. Requested phone number swap. Inputted all correct details online. Advised of day and time for switch. Still nothing. Rang to enquire when switch would occur. Advised it would be by 6pm guaranteed. Still nothing.,1
"I tried to log into the ID app. It asked for my email password. Not my ID password, but my actual email password.",1
"The prices are very appealing but simply put you get what you pay for - I am in London and my signal is simply appalling, especially when in crowded areas. While my partner who is with Sky is getting full bars of 5G I am suffering with one or two bars of 3G. I managed, hence the 3 stars, but I make this as a warning to anyone thinking of signing up.",1
"I live in a small village where the signal can be a bit on and off, I, at times, have to go outside if I need to make a call. When I'm in or closer to the nearest big town it works a lot better thankfully.",1
"Have decided to give a review after 6 months . Firstly signal is ok most of the time with infrequent drop outs .App , used to work and now just sits there looking pretty . The customer service number on the app sends you to curry’s customer support in South Africa , lovely girl, Sadly wrong company.ID mobile customer service (finally caught up with them in somewhere in Africa ) advised me incorrectly that I had to pay roaming charges when it’s clearly written in my contract that I have 30gb within my available data available for Europe .Loose two stars for bad App and false information.Sadly they need to get their excrement together .",1
"I only have 1 bar when at home, when I used to have 4-5 bars when I used to be with EE.",1
"My sim only deal is fab my only complaint is that it doesn’t work when I’m on holiday in Europe ie,… Portugal, turkey, Greece",1
Just visited Durham city and my signal was very poor unable to take calls at one point. Even though the caller kept trying,1
"I was getting charged £19 per month instead of the £15 plan I was on. This happened for most of the year. When I queried it and raised a complaint, I don't feel it was dealt with properly.I feel the plan I am on is very good value, but the extra charges apparently were from Sky, which I don't subscribe too.Also, I still, a couple of months on, haven't had a satisfactory response about my complaint. Disappointed!",1
"Poor signal where I live currently and my old address. It's not IDs fault its three, they used to be my fave network as I was a courier travelling the country and always had a signal, but this last 2 years almost has been annoying.  I'm going to give EE a go in September.",1
"I used to be really happy with the service that ID provided but just recently I've been facing lots of little annoyances. The app is no longer working (I'm unable to update to the new one as it won't let me. I either get a) we're too busy at the moment or b) we're having technical issues.Unfortunately, this means that I can't check my data or usage which is vital as I'm now working away from home and my usage has increased a lot (I switched plans only one month ago from 6GB to 50GB).This isn't really ID's fault but their signal in my new work area isn't great, so I looked around and can get better deals with other providers now so it's a no-brainer.Leaving was very simple though and the PAC code was sent almost immediately.",1
Despite using 3 network I sometimes struggle to get a good connection.Good price and customer service.,1
"I've been with ID mobile for a while, everything runs smoothly and there ha e been no issues. The reason I've only given 3 stars is that I know they now offer better deals than the one I'm on, but have never offered these to me.",1
I was told I would get a £100 voucher when I updated my phone. Still waiting after a week.,1
"Unfortunately signal in my area was very poor. After dealing with customer service, they agreed to let me go to a different provider without having to pay the fee. I am changing my rate from 1 star to 3 stars due to the support received.",1
I have been a customer for many years..maybe loyalty reward perhaps would be great.,1
Normal have no issues. Great network and package but for the last week the App has been out of use. Need to re register on new app and can't. No way of finding my details only by phoning the hotline. Please sort it out!!!!,1
"I’ve been with ID for years and always been happy with service and price but a couple of months ago I lost signal at work, even outside the building, and it caused me no end of problems not being able to contact or be contacted.  It has not resolved so I have been forced to change to a different provider who uses a different network",1
"Don’t like very often having no service, will be changing back to my old provider",1
"I had an account only 2 month and you have changed the login system. The stupid things is to log in, you have to reregister where you ask all the questions that a scammer asks, for example complete password, full name, mobile number etc. My bank only asks partial passwords when they update their system. Partial mobile number etc",1
"Haven't had an issue with my sim nor Internet connection. Obviously it wouldn't work in some areas but overall it's good, sim is affordable and three network too.I'm not happy about the new though. Doesn't tell when my contract is finished and the app wanted me to set up the again even when i regularly open it. Mad. The automated service hasn't got an option to listen to my contract expiry date.",1
"Why do I have to register every time I open the app, it is becoming very annoying.",1
I am waiting for your website to come back online.,1
"FIVE DAYS, YES FIVE DAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT TO MY ACCOUNT",1
"I think you should look after existing customers .I need a new phone but to upgrade is more expensive than if I was a new customer ,think I’ll have to change providers",1
"the Company is fine. the coverage I get in my area (Airedale / Wharfedale) leaves a lot to be desired, and seems to be getting worse over time. I need to use my phone for work, so this needs addressing, and if the Company can't do it, I'll have to move provider.",1
I tried to get in touch with you but system didn't seem to be working. Obviously disappointed,1
Could offer more data for the price in today's market but overall ok.Connection is poor in some locations so limited.,1
There's a lot of time I get cut off in the middle of a call.,1
"I don't get a signal in a lot of places, or signal drops out and I have not network at all, need to rescan only to be told no network available for hours at a time.",1
"Generally, iD does what I need so long as I don't need to go onto the website. I never can get it to recognise my password, and when I tried to change my password yesterday I had to wait 2HOURS for the code to arrive so I never could change my password. This is the second time this has happened. I never can get online by logging in. It's very frustrating",1
Good value but signal not always good. 5G not available or reliable in my area.,1
Have had a number of connection issues since joining. Offered incentive to introduce friends but now only pay after 3 months. No way to speak to anybody. All in all quite disappointing,1
Data connection too slow,1
I have always had excellent experienceHowever I think the fees to cancel my contract are a little excessive as I need to do this due to financial issues,1
Coverage not always great at home.  Very annoying re international service - charges are expensive.,1
At times it will not pick up signal to allow me to browse the Internet....Otherwise I am happy with notifications regarding using sims outside UK.,1
Too expensive,1
Hate it when I am in the middle of doing something and then the phone cuts in.,1
"I've been with ID mobile for many years now.  I am not an avid phone user so overall it meets my basic UK needs.  However, there are a few things that I would love to see fixed.  1),  The biggest problem for me is the extra charges price cap of £25.  This became a problem to me when my mother fell ill overseas.  I maxed out the extra charges while out of the country, and then didnt have any ability to use my phone when I needed it most.  Just to be clear I've always paid on time and as for the extra charges, I would have paid it up front, but there wasn't any way I could do this either.   2) Every time I make an international call I get a text warning me that it is an additional charge.  There doesn't seem to be any way to turn this automatic text message off.   I make an international call every two weeks so its just become an annoyance.   So I've given it 3 stars for these reasons above.  It could be 5 stars otherwise.1/4/24 Edit:  Have discussed with customer service and have been able to increase the price cap, so I'm grateful for that.  The live customer service agent (once i got past the chat bot) was very helpful.  On this note, it was unnecessarily complex.  I was unable to access live chat from the app, having to go out of the app to find the link. Then having to talk to a bot first.   Not ideal, so whilst one problem was solved, due to the barriers and time it took to get through them, I'm leaving the score at 3 stars.",1
Great value for money & not many network problems but very very difficult to communicate with.So all ok once you’ve set up but if you have any problems you cannot speak to anyone only online chats which keep cutting out!,1
"I need a warning if I’m going over my allowance of minutes, messages or gigs please.",1
"It's a nice package, but signal strength seriously limits its usefulness.  I cannot make calls from where I live; many places I go have very poor 4g signal.  If I force my phone to go with 3g, the signal improves for phone calls, but data rates fall significantly, and that is my primary reason for having an ID SIM card.",1
"+ Good network coverage, reasonable price- charged for emojis in texts, app is useless and won’t let me update, I keep asking for PAC and you keep telling me you ran into a problem even though it’s my correct DOB in the correct format",1
No feedback on request to block premium deal alert which are charging £1.50 each time. I did not knowingly apply for these text and impossible to stop so reduced capped to nil. Need to make calls to Jersey but can’t till sure not being charged.,1
"Updated app is poor upgrade. Slow to progress through pages the 'Oops something went wrong. try again"" message occurs multiple times. The old app was fine and the mobile service was good.",1
Not always good reception in the Hampshire New Forest District....,1
"Experience with IDI am more than happy with the app, is quite easy to use.I have just updated the ID app and now not able to bring up live chat.Being a pensioner I just wish that I could actually speak to somebody and not just message.  It would be nice to have human contact.I appreciate you asking for my feedback",1
good value package inc roaming but unfortunately poor signal at home & poor customer service when raising issues,1
"Overall ok, but not reliable.",1
It draws you in as seems cheap but doesn't include alot of things my previous provider did so I find I have to be careful how and what I use on my phone now as sometimes my bill is more expensive than my last provider and I'll be honest I'm not sure I'll continue with I'd.,1
Data connection very poor generally. All very well offering high GB's of data with plans but if the connection is poor what's the point?,1
The sims cheap. But often i cant get internet outside. Am going to end my contact.,1
Poor internet coverage .sometimes nothing at all.Happens all the time,1
Difficult to actually talk to someone at ID,1
negative - you can never speak to anyonepositive - it's fairly cheap,1
"I have struggled when trying  to use my phone abroad .... can't make calls except via WhatsApp when Internet is availablepppp. The phone says it is ready to go, but I never receive a welcome text when I cross boarders.",1
Hard to contact if your query does not fit the categories you allow,1
"Generally very happy with the service but wanted to transfer my now older son's account to his own name but can't without losing his number, which he doesn't want to do. As a consequence, will probably have to leave at some point. What a shame.",1
Signal often 1/2 bars and poor quality,1
Customer service is terrible as unable to talk to an agent,1
Single strength in house week compared to EE and vodaphone only 1 bar,1
When there is a problem there is no telephone number where you can speak to a member of staff. It is all online. It would be nice to have more person to person contact.,1
"The signal can be hit and miss, especially when it rains at home....",1
"The company offers competitive prices to start with, which is good. However, the price increases annually and I started off paying £23 a month and I am now paying £27.30 a month. As a student I would prefer to be with a network that will keep my price the same for the duration of my contract. Therefore, when my contract is up I will be switching to a provider such as VOXI or Asda Mobile who do not have mid-conract price rises.",1
Mobile coverage often not good.Europe free roaming good but difficult to detail the actual free coverage area when on holidayAdvance warning before charges would be good.,1
Would prefer to be able to deal with you by phone,1
The cost is very competitive but the coverage isn’t always as good as it could be.,1
"They're customer service is amazing however the actual service, is stupid. When they have planned work in the area, they don't message to let you know (my son has cardiac conditions and on the day the network was down, I couldnt phone the cardiac department from the phone, thankfully we have the landline). Its took more than 4 days to apply a new contract that I still havent had applied to my sim so I'm not too impressed and there is never anyone to actually speak to, it's all via chat which isnt too bad sometimes but sometimes you just need to speak to an actual person, Hoping I get my contract sorted soon as I've been told 2 different dates now. This isn't the first time I've been told different dates either, I was told 2 different billing dates at the start of my first contract with them and had to chase it up.",1
"Ok company with cheap price, yet the data coverage in London is abysmal. You see « 4g » yet you have no internet!",1
"It’s ok.Positive: it’s a virtual operator.  Nice app to manage account.Negative: cost of extras, ie sending pictures in text messages.  Increase monthly payments every April to maximise their profits.  Hoping this is made illegal soon as its not a fair policy for customers who are on a fixed contract term.",1
I have 3 phone contracts but only one email address so I can only communicate about 1 phone. I have tried to solve this problem by using live chat which is absolutely useless. They really need a phone number so you can talk to someone,1
Quite a lot of the time I am unable to get a signal.,1
"Mithers the life out of you with emails most days. The 99° UK network coverage boasted by Three is great, unfortunately I seem to be always in the 1° area no matter where I am. Very dissapointed.",1
I live in West Cornwall but 3 coverage is I’m afraid poor.I am missing phone calls-my son in Sussex often cannot reach me. Internet is difficult to get in many areas where I would like it. No problem with the actual phone though.Had no issues with previous provider.,1
Dislike nothing about the service but very disappointed not to have received the voucher I and my husband were promised as he introduced me to id mobile months ago. Currently neither of us has received the promised Curry's vouchers,1
Unable to communicate with a human! You have docked my usage even though I have not used the monthly quota.Coverage is poor in comparison to other networks only plus is the plan is cheap,1
Normal use in UK is great with good coverage at a reasonable price. Do not appreciate being charged for texts to Europe and Roaming is prohibitive with Switzerland excluded from plan.,1
"Price is excellent. But internet is unreliable - often down for seconds or minutes at a time, which is very frustrating",1
"I have been with ID for just over six months on a SIM only contract, I have no issue with this service and would recomend them for value and ease of use of their APP. My issue was when I decided to migrate to a 24mth phone contract, I contacted their online agents and after some security checks they confirmed that I could upgrade to the deal I had seen on line. I recieved a phone call directly from them to set the contract up, after all the usual passing over of details the end result was that I did not qualify for the deal because of a financial reason.This is very strange as my credit score is very excellent, they asked if I would consider a cheaper phone and then they might be able to help, this i declined. I went straight to the Apple UK site oredered my phone over 24mths interest free with no issue, very strange how they ID have lost a sale when I know I have no issue getting credit elsewhere.I will still be keeping my ID SIM but just annoying that I couldn't get the phone that I wanted from them.",1
So far so good need ask me 6 months time,1
Price is spot on but I don't get very good WiFi when I'm at my caravan in northumberland sometimes we have no WiFi all weekend which is not good,1
Very reasonably priced but reception is shocking. Have moved from a larger more known provider and have seen a significant drop in coverage for both phone and data. So frustrating!,1
"I like the online app and the fact you can monitor your usage. The monthly spend is competitive and there are no roaming charges when visiting other countries … I love that! The only downside is the internet connection which is not always good … I’m often looking at 1 or 2 bars when I’m out and need my mobile. This could be improved as it’s non-existent, most of the time, in my area.",1
"I am not happy with 3 network, it goes down regular! We will be losing our landlines soon, so I will be relying on my mobiles network! I need a reliable network for people to contact me.",1
Good service and very cheap to use in the UK but no package to be able to use in Turkey or outside Europe. Would really appreciate economical package to be able to add on to use when away (out of Europe),1
Do not like extra charges for multimedia messages,1
"Reasonably priced, good value sim only contracts for my husband and I; but disappointing customer service.  My husband's contract included £45 worth of Amazon gift vouchers 3 months after taking out the contract.  We have not received these vouchers and have not received a reply to a form we completed saying we hadn't received them, nor to an email we followed this up with when we didn't get a response.  Still waiting to hear back.Update:  Following on from iD's response to this review, we have now received our vouchers.  Also, my contract came to an end and I have upgraded it to an even better deal - 100GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts, sim only, for the same price as the old contract, £10 per month.  Excellent value.",1
"Had a smooth transition from Three to iD Mobile, keeping my old number. No issues at all. Downloaded the app and that all worked fine. Logged on in web browser and downloaded a statement. Also easy and trouble-free. All good.August 2024 update:I took out an Id Mobile contract after following a link on their web site and receiving an email promising a £30 amazon gift card. After 90 days, no gift. After chasing it via their agent (Giftcloud) and providing copious evidence, I finally get told ""the ID mobile team has declined the issuance of the reward for your sign up"". No explanation or reason given. Basically I was scammed into taking out a contract.",1
I do not get a signal at home I have to go outside to get text messages,1
The strength of signal in my area deteriorated last week. In some areas cants connect.,1
4G is very poor,1
I wish the coverage was better but apart from that I can't fault ID mobile so far as my bills represent good value for money and haven't been raised.  I haven't had to contact them so the rating doesn't reflect dealing with customer services.  I am now reducing by 1 star as their login process has changed - now a multi-click process instead of 1 which uses Google Recaptcha.  I have serious concerns for my privacy with sites that use this.,1
i cannot get a signal in some areas in my house,1
When I took out my contract at £43 pm within 1 week you could get it for £34,1
Generally the phone service seems to be not so good where I live but people using say EE have much better reception.,1
"The network used to be really good now all I get is poor reception, Internet slow, videos buffering. 3 bars at most for majority of the time but the mobile data is pretty dire!! Looking to switch.",1
I think you provide a good service cheep and good service,1
"Cheap and cheerful but many, more than a third, phone calls have delayed sound, sometimes up to a 10 second delay which makes the call impossible",1
"Difficult when having more than one account, identifying which is which can be difficultGood prices, perfect for children",1
Setting up took ages as I am a disabled user. The gentle at  the counter in curry’s was gracious and helpful.I struggled to get on live chat and searched unsuccessfully for a phone number to aid.  I took me four days before a relative could sort it out for me.,1
"I love ID usually. However was not happy when bought daughter phone and contract in Aug 22. Discussed cost of various phones at length with agent, because couldnt afford too much but was 18th birthday present. He never advised me that cost would go up with RPI in april so it went from £29 to £34 within7 months andno doubt will go up again this april. Next time i get phone with contract, im going to tesco mobile where price is same for length of CONTRACT because it is a CONTRACT so in my opinion should stay same price",1
"I did not realise I could not send emojis without incurring charges, this is a habit difficult to stop and I keep incurring charges. It seems rude you can't just send a heart for free!",1
"I've just moved from EE to iD. I'm really quite unsure. I went for them because they were recommended on Money Savings Expert. My new sim came through as expected and porting seemed to go fine. However, my phone insisted on retaining the original number of the sim rather than the new number.  That's when things got a bit flaky. Firstly, it's difficult to get through to a human being, they expect everything to be done by bot but their bot didn't understand my problem. The only solution is to go through ""cancel contract"" options. They said that they woudl send out a new sim. I checked that this would have my ported number and they confirmed so. It arrived, I put it in my phone; I switched the phone off and on. Nothing. No signal. I could now enter the correct number in the phone settings but then had to change back to the original sim to get any signal and make calls.Then I sent a web link to my wife and immediately received a text from iD to say that any MMS messages sent would be charged at 55p per message! So if you send someone a picture; a video; an audio message, iD will charge you 55p. Now I understand why the up front price is low...the gauge you elsewhere.I'll see what else the hit me with but I'm half way out the door with them.Then I've had a number of instances where I can hear the person's voice I was calling but they could not hear me.Finally, the reception is quite poor compared to my previous provider.",1
Not always a great reception. There have been occasions when an error alert came up which made no sense. The network also affects the s21 samsung mobile.,1
Trying to actually talk to someone in customer services is a nightmare.,1
"Usually good, but too many outages recently",1
"WOULS SIAN FROM ID WHO REPLIED TO MY LAST REVIEW PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN REPLY TO HER, THANKS.",1
The signal strength (Three Mobile)  is not good generally - EE signal much better...,1
Telephone service has been unavailable over the last few days.,1
When you sign on and have to change your existing account you need to have the telephone number of the new telephone number with you up front and with you. You don't provide that immediacy.,1
my signal is not always good and in west sleek burn in Scotland it does not work at all,1
Very poor customer service. Difficult to get any problem sorted. But generally good network coverage.,1
Good flexible account but customer service poor.,1
"I THOUGHT I WAS UPGRADING MY SIM ONLY DEAL,IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WENT THROUGH AS A NEW DEAL, SO NOW I AM PAYING 2 LOTS OF D/D, AND I ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO MY OLD A/C, THESE PEOPLE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH, WHEN I FINALLY DID, THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR CANCELLING THE NEW CONTRACT, UNBELIEVABLE,",1
I like ID but was unhappy that I couldn’t keep my old ID number when I changed online to a cheaper package with ID,1
I was with IDmobile for a quite a while which I really  enjoyed their data roll over.  But recently they are having network issues with the connection which was dropping on daily basis so I decided to switch to a different network.,1
"In the short time I've had this contract after moving from EE the ID Mobile service has been lost, while you have no service or Internet on your phone your also unable to contact support via there App on someone else's phone on another network,The network needs to be improved, in 10 years I've been with Orange then EE I can remember only 1 time I had no service due to a network issueIn 3 months ID mobile has been down twice and its a day long issueWe need another way to contact ID Mobile support when the service goes offline even if its just a recorded message to say why its gone down yet againOther than that when it works its greatAll we ask if for better support",1
Great for paying cheaper prices for newer phones but the connection is shocking I never have connection I'm never able to ring out or anything despite having unlimited texts call and data,1
"Generally good.Would like to see an insurance option. I keep breaking phones, or phones let me down outside of the warranty conditions and I  have to complete the contract with another phone I've had to buy.Also I'm left high and dry with unlimited data that doesn't work in the USA.I'd like to see multiple phone number contract concessions for those with several dependants using phones and contracts I'm paying for.",1
Not possible to talk to any staff member only idiotic robot,1
I can't always connect to Internet with my data and sometimes i cant send messages especially to certain number (my granddaughter) very often it says no network connection I wouldn't recommend id mobile sorry,1
"The one thing every customer service department should have is a telephone contact number, using the only way to contact ID mobile is by chat ,which is not acceptable.",1
"I love the tariff. I love the communication about the bill's. I have given 3 stars as our signal is appalling when at home. My husband even bought a new phone in case that was the problem but still the sameI am not sure if it is ID mobile's fault, but there is no way of knowing.  People visiting with other networks have no problem.",1
"Very variable phone cover. Keep getting cut off with ""You are not allowed to call this number"".",1
"Network reception is poor, struggle to send messages quiet a lot of the time.",1
Good monthly charge but signal strength/line speed in our location poor.,1
Coverage is quite limited in many areas that are not remote,1
"Signal is not the best in places keeps dropping out, never had this issue with Vodafone , can be very annoying",1
"I have only gone on line to buy a mobile phone because of the closure of Carphone Warehouse, they were brilliant at sorting my phone deals out and any problems I had.  I cannot easily navigate the ID website and feel there is too much emphasis on information for new customers and not enough guidance for existing customers. I attempted to get a sim only deal as I liked my phone. I wanted to seamlessly carry on with my old number etc.  However somehow I got it wrong.  Eventually after a very anxious hour of trying to find out how to sort the mistake out as I had ended up with two contracts I found a way to get a telephone number to actually speak to someone and registered myself as a vulnerable customer.  Since then I feel so much happier using the service. They helped me with all the difficulties I was experiencing. I am over 70",1
"Coverage over quality.I've been using ID mobile for many years and I have always been on their SIM only monthly rolling contract deals - I have always found them very competitive throughout the years with really good upgrade opportunities.It's been so easy to change my deals, set limits and even order a new SIM - all trough the app. Great experience there, nothing to complain about.Data rollover was genuinely my favourite thing when I first got my SIM with ID. Amazing feature, love it, I would hate to lose it.For voice only I have rarely had issues even in rural Wales - I've had decent coverage & been able to make phone calls and have always thought that the network coverage was adequate. Good stuff.However the 4G and 5G infrastructure is seriously lacking in areas with high traffic, for example - Cardiff city centre - it takes me one minute to load a web page (5G, full signal). Cardiff Albany road, further out of the city centre in a less congested area (5G, full signal) - still the same, cannot even text in WhatsApp.For about a year or two I have been blaming my dated Samsung galaxy S10 plus (I was on 4G). However I just got a brand new Samsung galaxy s23 plus and I have already replaced my SIM card (just in case) and I am still facing the same problems... Getting stuck in the middle of town trying to get a taxi home, with full 5G signal and no internet was the straw that broke the camels back.What good is a high internet allowance with rollower if I can't even use it when it is most needed?It's time to switch, reluctantly...",1
Would like an option to purchase international call and data for countries not in the roaming group. Or increase maximum credit limit of £30.,1
I find that coming over from EE to ID has proven to be a mistake EE COVERAGE  I find is better but I will give it a couple of months then reacess the situation,1
"I’m disappointed on how long it takes the complaints team to answer the phone it’s like they only have a few people working and when it comes to network issues in the area they are very evasive and difficult to deal with when it comes to offering any form of credit without me mentioning it directly or them saying they will call me back the next day, only for nothing to happen for it to have to go to deadlock and then having to wait another 10 to 14 days for it to be decided despite their being evidence of an issue that’s clearly not going to be resolved in a timely manor the Complaints procedure needs to be modernised so each individual Complaints handlers has the Access and authority so the Complaint does not go from person to person and complaint to deadlock despite the resolution originally being agreed but not actioned on account",1
"I was recently told by BT that they offer a similar package for just under £8 per month - that is, almost £5 less a month than I pay ID Mobile.I wonder if I should be renewing my contract.",1
"Whilst the actual contract is fantastic value for money, unfortunately reception in my area - Woodley Reading - rarely jumps above 2 bars. Occasionally on my local travels, call drop off happens - (Samsung S21Ultra)",1
I am a 89 year old pensioner trying to take to a real person to dicuss my monthly bill. I have phoned on many occasions but unfortunately get referred to a computer. I don't have one and I have had no help. Please consider the older people.,1
"Signal not so great. Even though the coverage checker showed great coverage indoor and out, I'm lucky to get 2 bars but it's usually 1 or none with calls breaking up. Wifi calling is hit and miss also.",1
"I find the indoor reception is a bit hit and miss where I live and work and the coverage can be a bit sketchy at times. The flip side is when there is a good 5g connection, I have seen speeds up to 700Mbps.",1
Dislike variable billing dates. Need to stick to the same date every month.,1
Good service whilst the contract is running but impossible to contact the company if you have any queries or need to cancel.,1
The app constantly plays up. Can’t download bills again.Otherwise I’m really happy with the service.Gone on the desktop site and all I get is a blank screen!,1
The price is amazing and the fact that it is a one month rolling contract means I know I can cancel at anytime should I wish.I do find though that the coverage is not always as good on other networks.,1
It is difficult to understand data usage  and where data is used before finding that extra charges are charged.,1
Difficulty in making contact to discuss issues or resolve problems,1
I was on a Cruise from the 17th December 2023 to 29thDecember 2023...I was unable to use my phone 🤳.... but I have just been told that my next bill will be £97 ...... For What,1
Your network is poor where I live also l can't talk to your customer service regarding problems,1
Account access should be easier. Better guidance on charges when outside of the EU.,1
The fact that we can't speak to an anyone directly can make things very difficult at times,1
"Using PayG system is very flakey.Every few days the network simply stops working. Can't text or call because I'm ""out of credit"" and the app won't let me login due to a technical error.Once it's working again, I can see that I am definitely not out of credit.Other than that, it's a good experience.Please fix",1
I don’t like the fact that the price rises during the time of the contract- I’d like to know how this is justified.,1
I dislike that I was mis sold a phone last year that I have never used and was not allowed to return. I can't wait for my contract to end somi can go elsewhere and get decent customer service.,1
Difficulty in accessing internet when out and about.,1
"Confusing website and “chat” option.  Wrong phone number notification for SIM card, sent twice.  A lot of my time wasted.",1
"This review relates to the refer a friend scheme only, overall with the rest of the ID mobile,  I've had no problems.The refer a friend scheme seems designed to make sure you don't get the referral monies, unless you have the time and persistence. It starts well that you get a link to use to instigate the referral. Other companies then use this link to track and pay the bonus, but not ID mobile.The first step is the referred person needs to make contact to enter the  account number within 14 days. (Hurdle 1)Then you need to remember 90 days later that you referred someone as the money is not credited automatically. If you manage to remember then after a live chat your be told that the other person, either the referrer or referee needs to make contact first as well.  (Hurdle 2).The other person then makes contact and that seems to unlock some blocker on the referee account. (Hurdle 3).Then the referee has to make contact again to again request the bonus is paid (Hurdle 4).You are then told that for the other person to get their bonus they have to make contact again. (Hurdle 5).If you have read this review to this point - you are probably someone who might get the bonus, you have persistence!I queried the process and was sent terms and conditions of the scheme, it may say that you have to take all these steps (it just feels like they are there to thwart issuing the bonus), but in summary won't be referring anyone else - the process is just unnecessarily too time consuming and complicated.",1
"My phone is always cutting off, and my WYFY is rubbish.I could not find a number to ring only a live chat, which I phoned. That day my phone was cutting off every phone call.",1
"The transfer process was traumatic. I was never sure whether I had retained my mobile number.  I was not sure of where I was in the transfer process. Given a choice of transfer date, I chose the earliest date given. Perhaps obvious, my existing supplier stopped my mobile service at 5 pm on that day. But my new SIM card from ID had not arrived by that day. So I had no mobile connection. I contacted iD by chat, and was advised to go to Currys and they would provide a new SIM card and activate it. They installed it but said Currys is not enabled to activate it. I had to find the a way forward on getting home - not aware if where I was in the transfer process. But they were helpful and knowledgeable thankfully, and sorted it. The original new SIM card arrived a day later by post - two days after the transfer date.May I suggest:A road map of progress and actions required.Fewer unco-ordinated and confusing emails in the transfer process.Early reassurance that the original mobile number has definitely been retained.Longer allowance for SIM card delivery by post in regard to the transfer date.Less direction to the chat line and easier access to the helpline people.But there have been no problems with the service since.",1
"I have been with ID for a couple of years and the reception is good so I ordered an upgrade. This never turned up. DPD delivered the phone to the incorrect address and 4 weeks later I still don't have a phone because ID customer services are difficult to get hold of and non-productive. Once you do get through, just passing the blade to DPD I find a customer service process very poor.",1
"The price is good, but the service range is poor and I can't access the internet using roaming when I am out and about.",1
"Don't know if this is an iD Mobile issue, but every so often (sometimes very often) 4G stops working and the only way to get it back is to restart my phone. Generally good coverage for where I go.",1
All was well until last night when I could not get the app to load up.On checking my bill it looks like both mine and my husbands have a computer malfunction just symbols all over the pages making the bill unreadable.Such a shame as I was very happy until this.,1
"Very reasonable pricing but not great coverage.I frequently seem to be unable to connect to a mobile signal, which is a nuisance. On the other hand, I really appreciate that at the moment at least it is possible to use my phone in Europe without extra changes.",1
"What I would like to see: Helpful people, cheerful people good thoughts from authorities for older people and then action. Politicians to be thinking of how to aid society and then do it, and not just about their income. Lowering of prices and expenses for older people.",1
When I'm out in Spain it doesn't switch automatically to data. I have to switch the phone off then on to get connected.,1
I can’t get a good signal in my home and have to rely on Wi-Fi to make calls. Very disappointing to pay for service which doesn’t work properly at my home address,1
"Nice to receive an email telling me my bill is available online. Would be even better if the link worked...do these coders EVER check their work? This follows on from iOS not being able to read their pdf files. OK - that was an Apple issue but, with the number of iPhones in circulation, I'd have liked to have been advised of the problem by iD Mobile proactively...",1
Speaking to a person would be much better than live chat,1
"When ever I am abroad, I can't send a photograph by messenger or by my e mails. It was ok on WhatsApp App but my son doesn't have that, so was unable to be in touch as much as I would have liked. Hard getting through on the fone to, so had to keep using my husbands fone. Very disappointed.",1
"Signal on both phone and Internet not great in my area, I have to rely on WiFi calling. We do live in a dip which doesn't help, however I am moving soon to a much better signal area 😊",1
Whilst I appreciate the tariff I pay is low I find it frustrating that very often I can't get a signal on my phone. I have missed many important calls and messages because of this.,1
I like the amount of texts and phone call times allowed.  I dont like the fact that i cant talk to someone in person for assistance.  I dont like doing everything online.  I dont understand how to talk to someone about whether i can pay a one off extra package while on holiday in south africa so that i am able to use my sim only account when away.,1
Unfortunately your network is not as good as it was before. Found that I'm not getting good reception from my home which never was an issue at the beginning.,1
"Certain phone numbers are not supported (which I didn't realise) and I got cut off whilst talking to my insurance company.Several texts say 'undelivered' but are actually delivered, so I'm never sure.It's very cheap.",1
Why 3 stars? Great value for money but... awful speed. Shows 4G/5G... 3-4 Mbps.Rollover data is meaningless as you just can't use the data because of low speed.,1
"The low cost of ID's SIM-only deals is great, as well as not being locked into a contract. These reasons would lead me to give ID 5 stars, but I've only given 3 stars because if you have a problem, you can never speak to a real person and for that reason I be would only give their customer 1 star.",1
To many hidden cost that are not mentioned when taking the contract. Bill is always £14/15 pound that’s 40% higher that contract!!!,1
"They do not keep bugging you with promotions, they are reasonably priced for the services they provide, but could do better with roaming charges and explanations. Overall a reasonable company to deal with.",1
"Purely online customer service is not ideal. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Thank you for your response to this review, giving me additional ways of contacting you, albeit online.",1
I may need to change from ID Mobile because the reception is unreliable at home.,1
Good phone and network service. Very dissatisfied with customer service when device fault found at contract renewal. This will prompt me to look at alternative providers at next renewal.,1
We constantly have connection issues at home with poor signal quality and calls dropping in and out. We are equi distant from 2 masts and I think the issue is that we keep flipping between masts on where we are in the house,1
"The upside is brilliant priced packages which are very competitive. However, the downside is bad customer care, basically stemming from the fact that it is almost impossible to get through to you when you have an issue, having to queue endlessly on a chat box. If you can resolve that I would definitely give you 5 stars!",1
"It’s just that I have poor reception from my home with this new provider, only one bar.",1
Loyalty is a thing of the past we get nothing for staying with the same company.Mobile from Curry's as you will know but the price advertised was only for new customers but not advertised as so. Had to get the lesser Mobile I went in for because of monthly payments.So this is surely under the trade description act. Other then that quite content.,1
You need to make it easier to obtain a PAC code.,1
"I am having problems with the app. I am a returning customer and it hasnt work since I returned, I have deleted and reloaded but still it wont work.",1
better coverage required and less false coverage indicators published. Coverage shows excellent on site but barely one bar in reality.,1
I have no issues in any customer service I have had.Sometimes I can not get any signal which is annoying.,1
The reception is okayBut to get any help or assistance is virtually IMPOSSIBLE,1
"Great service, info & app but coverage via 3 is rather limited. It often falls particularly when driving when using goigle maps.",1
"Instead of bombarding your customers with emails, you might like to invest in human customer service. A phone number that is quickly answered by a human.",1
I found it so difficult to change my plan & got so stressed you do not take into account the old & vunerable. I did evenually get to speak to someone. I would suggest that you arrange a better system,1
The 5G coverage appears to be good as it seems to be accessible in a number of places but data drops out consistently,1
Rarely get a signal and unless I am in a town or city never get internet don’t think I will be staying with ID,1
The network is not good sometimes I can't send message and sometimes voice calls are not proper it cuts off during the conversation.,1
Very poor connection. Sometimes when on a call line breaks up or totally disconnects the call.,1
My signal has never been more than 2.5barsThis was much lower than when I checked what this would be prior to switching to id mobile from EE. I have tried to raise a complaint but this requires so many passwords and PIN numbers either by phone or onlineYou need to look into this for me,1
Have tried without success since November to change to sim only for 12 pound per month. Have received order number 130679568. But still no response. My wife is now on the plan I requested. Iam still being charged 37. 87. Which is not Good Enough.Please Sort this out ASAP.,1
"iD misspelt my name. I contacted iD chatline and asked the iD rep to change the first letter of my first name from a W to Y.  My first name begins with a Y.  I spent over 3hrs on the chatline - the iD rep requested a copy of my passport, bills with my name on it etc. Which I could not give because I was not at home.   iD had already taken a direct debit payment from my bank account which of course had my correct name.  After 3 hrs the iD rep said she/he had corrected my name but in fact she/he lied as it has not been corrected.",1
"The product is a good one, but the lack of direct customer service ( I.e it is difficult to talk to a real person ) is off putting",1
ID Mobile provides a great value package but this comes at a price... for any issues getting hold of a person via chat or phone is nearly impossible. Your only option for a result is using the group conversations and someone providing an answer.,1
Great price but expect terrible customer service. You get what you pay for.,1
Positives. Easy to set up and Id keep me informed and I like the rolling data ideaNegatives poor reception at home and outside,1
"Signal coverage isn't great, at times can't make phone calls, no signal coverage",1
"Very intermittent and poor signal in my area, so check carefully and do not beleive the signal maps. Impossoble to cancel contract so stuck",1
When I want a query there is no one on ID side. You get some one to answer on the PC or the phone screen.I need to speak to some one in person.Very disappointed.,1
"I can't remember a recent experience??Good:However, im very happy with my and my daughters plan.Bad:Wish it was easier to talk or communicate with somebody.",1
I don't like that you are not able to speak to anyone on the telephone. I had an issue and I was never able to get it resolved.,1
Good contract deals available.New phone arrived promptly. No instructions at all on how to transfer data from old Samsung mobile to new. No chance of speaking to a live person about anything. They just leave you to it!,1
"There is no easy way to contact ID Mobile so I shall continue to share my experiences with this, wider audience. Having been invited to download a pdf version of my monthly bill I received 4 pages of complete gibberish....It might be easy to solve if only I could speak to a human being...",1
Changed from Three because cheaper and discovered network coverage not as good. V disappointing as I travel constantly in the Uk but you get what you pay for.,1
"I wasn't happy with my new contract,,I was promised unlimited tex ,calls but most of all unlimited data, the person I was dealing with said I would get it ,,cause at the time contract said just 10gigs data ,he said he could change it ,,I have now uped payments £23 a month to get the unlimited data .its a lot for me  ,I'm  74 no Internet in my flat",1
I’m going off the id mobile because the network is very bad I don’t get reception from my mobile phone in any big building I am looking for new network,1
"SIM seems to work fine, stuck in endless customer feedback loop attempting to set up app or account, which sucks massively...Lack of customer service is an issue.",1
I dislike the means by which I recover voice messages.,1
"Can't fault the phone for service, no problems experianced but to be charged more per month than is available for a recent model is unacceptable and i will not be renewing my contract in May 2024",1
Sitting here with 5g 4 bars and can't do nothing do anything with phone,1
Ever since I changed to id mobile i keep losing signal and I have to keep turning phone off and on to get it back I'd used to be good but not now ready to change network.,1
The Problem with your Company there’s not a Customer Service number I can phone up and speak directly to resolve any problems not chat lines or Iartificial intelligence.,1
The only problem I have is contacting someone.  I want to have a SIM only and not change my phone. It seemed my best option was to go to Curry's but there was such a queue of unhappy people I could not wait.,1
Ultimately a real person had to intervene to get the update I wanted to install correctly. On your auto system I ended up installing same deal twice. The help person who installed update about 10days ago didn't fully install as screens didn't appear on my phone to complete. So I thought it was fixed but it wasn't. I sent 3 emails asking for clarification of what was meant to be happening without response.,1
Okay but only average. Reception patchy.,1
I make comparatively little use of my phone. I simply get the service that I pay for.,1
"loyalty penalised !transferred my wife's account from id mobile to O2 recently. while I'm happy with I'd mobile, I could not get an upgrade phone for the same price as a new customer. the phone I was going to get from id mobile was only available to new customers and was quite a bit more expensive for existing customers .... so my wife became a new customer to O2 and cancelled Id mobile contract.would have been happy to stay with I'd mobile had the upgrade deal been the same as new customer deal.when my own contract is up I will probably also change supplier, should Id mobile still be penalising existing customers!",1
I had issues when upgrading my new mobile.You tried to charge me for the new phone and the old one.It took 5 phone calls to sort it out and was only sorted after I went through the complaints procedure. I was told numerous times someone would phone me back but they never did,1
Actual signal strength is well below that was suggested on checks done before I chose ID network. Low or NO signal at many locations I am at regularly.,1
Our SIM only deal is great for price but it is hit and miss for phone and internet coverage in our area near Dumbarton.Works great in the cities but on the outskirts too many times unable to access the internet or even make a phone call.,1
It has a great easy to use app with all the features like WiFi calling VoLTE etc. Unfortunately it has no 5g signal in Northern Ireland  and I'm having low to zero signal in a lot of areas I frequent . I have my pac code,1
"My husband and I both switched to ID mobile and whilst signal service abroad is great and included in our packages, the signal coverage for both of us in North Staffordshire is very poor. Particularly Trentham area and from Junction 15 to 19 on the M6, especially around Junction 16",1
Having used ID mobile for nine months now the reception is not always good especially at home.Also the monthly cost has soared more than expected.,1
Haven't been with you long enough to form an  opinion yet.Going abroad  soon so I'll wait and see how goodyour roaming is.,1
"I find the signal quite weak at times, it is very frustrating, I am considering changing",1
"I bought a new phone with a 24 month contract on iD Mobile on Black Friday. The SIM card doesn't work and when I try to register for an iD Mobile account online it says I have the incorrect details.  I spent several hours on the live chat trying to rectify the problem only to be told that my information does not match the details associated with the new number provided iD Mobile as part of the contract. Now iD refuse to help because they say I am not the account holder. Instead they told me to go back to Carphone Warehouse where I purchased the offer.My details on the Carphone Warehouse systems are correct but they claim they cannot do anything to help despite both iD Mobile and Carphone Warehouse being owned by Currys.After calling the complaints team at iD Mobile I was again told I wasn't the account holder and to email my account details and a copy of my ID to them.  I did this immediately and it took over 48 hours for them to reply that the details I gave them are incorrect or incomplete.  They asked for my iD Mobile customer PIN which I do not know because I cannot register for an online account and the name of my bank. I am still waiting for a response.I am concerned about my personal data and have reservations about using a company that can make such a big mistake without offering adequate customer service.  I'm now stuck paying for a SIM  card I cannot use on a contract that I cannot cancel! I  am also worried about how iD Mobile is handling my  personal data as this appears to be a pretty big breach.At this point I wouldn't recommend iD Mobile to anybody, from my experience the lower prices donot make up for the hassle and the stress.Update (15/12/2023): This issue has now finally been resolved by the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile. It has been a stressful couple of weeks and I feel that no customer should have to deal with the problems I have encountered, especially when the original issue was caused through no fault of my own.  I feel there is a lesson to be learned here for the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that communication between the two companies needs to be improved.Having said that, I would hope that the issue that I encountered was out of the ordinary and eventually I did manage to contact representatives from the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that were able to help me and provided a level of customer service that I would expect from a big company.  It's just a shame that this didn't happen in the first place.",1
My daughter arranged my account with you because of value for money .Unfortunately the reception in my house is only one bar on my phone which is poor,1
Keeps notifying me of voicemail that does not exist,1
"I feel that I got a very fair and good deal from iD mobile and I would have given 5 stars, but I've been waiting months for my promised £30 voucher, which was part of the deal, when I took out the contract. Having messaged the customer services twice, from the follow up emails, which I receive from them, I still haven't had a reply, or my £30 voucher. Their customer services is something which needs to be improved, even when trying to set up your phone as a new customer. If a company offers something as part of a special deal, they should honour it. There is nobody to talk to. Other than those problems, it all seems to work ok.",1
Lousy signal at home CA1 3TW embarrassing.,1
Lack of service without communicationPoor coverage,1
Seems a good deal then price goes up quite a bit..,1
Currys assistants were very helpful and I think the deal I got on the Pixel 7 Pro was very good.My critism is the fact that the phone signal when at home is very poor. Usually no more than 1 bar and often no signal at all.,1
"The help chat is very painful to use. The prices are good and the coverage is great thoThank you for the reply, interesting that you assume I have had trouble connecting someone on live chat, that's not the case. I was able to contact someone, but they were not able to resolve my issue, only able to half answer my problem",1
"Cant get into my account, you’ve got the wrong number for my phone",1
Price ok but new customers get a better deal and signal not the greatest  looking into moving,1
"Signal not greatI struggle to get more than a single bar of 5G reception fairly frequently even though before signing up with ID, I checked coverage and it was supposed to be fine. If I had known then what I knew now, I may not have signed with ID.",1
"Good service and signal in most areas. Had quite a delay retrieving my original phone number, approximately 2 weeks and began to worry if I'd made the right decision. This finally got sorted and all is well now",1
I was without my phone due no network signal for a day could not use the app and got no help using the bot,1
Did not have any service last Saturday and Sunday.Very disappointing.,1
I like the prompts given when using chargeable calls or messages- but not so happy with the internet connections.,1
"I am disappointed with the lack of coverage by the network which I've not experienced with O2, BT or EE",1
Signal strength is not what I expected. I seem to be getting a lot of dropped calls and poor signal when out about and wanting to use the internet.,1
Pros:  no problem its a mobile network.Cons: It's a 5G network but not available on all 5G handsets. My Nokia G50 (5G) phone is not supported.,1
"I cancelled my sim only contract to start another contract with a new phone.Unfortunately the sim only contract was never cancelled & I have been paying both for the last 3 months.I've had quite an ordeal to get my money back. It was an upsetting time as I am a pensioner & truly cannot afford to lose this money, through no fault of my own. They agreed finally to end the sim only contract & refund the money. But only after a long upsetting struggle. One that I didn't need at the moment",1
"I sign a new deal for £4:48 per month, within 2 months it went up to £8No read why and no notice given either",1
"Having written a 5* review 2 days ago, today the ID mobile network has been  unavailable, with no notification or information available unless I go hunting for it. At first I thought my phone was faulty and spent time trying to reset it!This is the first negative experience I've had with them. I accept that networks will at times experience technical problems, but this has been a full day now, and ID mobile should have attempted to notify customers - at the very least they could have emailed us. Even on their website updated information is sadly lacking.",1
"As of yesterday, I cannot connected to mobile data, have been trying constantly all day today and yesterday, that's why I only give a 3 star rating",1
"Difficult to get in touch with customer services through the app, takes too long to get a response.",1
"I recently needed to download a file,it took ages,the connection constantly dropped out and then reconnecting. I had 5 bars of signal strength and a 4g connection.",1
4G works in some areas and not others - which can be frustrating.,1
"Ordered an iPhone 13 24 month contract specifically because of the 3 month Apple Tv subscription they offer, yet nothing has been mentioned to me about this after my order was delivered. Live chat team member was unhelpful and didn't know anything about it. Very poor service from ID Mobile. Where is is my offer?",1
"So far, I am pleased with the internet connection.I am having a lot of problems with the messages that I try to send. Sometimes it says 'message failure' or 'not delivered'",1
"Good network for a low cost - if you need any customer service though go elsewhere!  No one will get back to you (it’s all auto response, no humans), there is no phone number and the ‘live-chat’ wanted to put me in a queue for an hour. Unfortunately will likely have to move elsewhere as there is no way to talk to anyone without going into store! Bit disappointed.",1
"ID mobile offer a great price and to be honest I haven’t used it yet.A cautious warning to those watching/ trying to build their credit score - they carry out a hard search and this dropped my score by nearly 100 points on clear score - not sure I would have bothered if I had known a 12 month pay monthly, £12, sim had this impact!!",1
iD mobile good....3 network has been appalling in my area over recent weeks!!,1
"The Motorola Edge 40 has some glitches, it won't default to wifi calling sometimes.Outlook freezes on the calendar (never happened with my Samsung)Forgets email passwords and I need to reload the account to get it functioning.",1
"The company is great, but the transfer /upgrade process was difficult",1
If there is a problem the only point of contact is ask the community and I prefer  to have direct contact either by chat or phone with company,1
"Not happy with the mid term CPI price increases, Phone signal not too good",1
"I get a lot for my money; however, the service isn't always guaranteed. Reception can be very sketchy and signal strength not great.",1
"Although I am relatively happy with ID mobile, I have been using it for a while now but have had no offers to upgrade or get a better deal than my 2gb",1
"No good with Internet,passwords etc .As long as I don't have a query  or important questionall will be fine.Can still write a letter.",1
"Please note the service is good, however the billing and PDF bills have switched to a foreign language in the app and cannot be changed. The app is a bit slow slow and clunky. However the network, service and support are good well worth it.",1
"Not long with iD and no issues in UK, so great value for money. Spent a couple of days in the Netherlands where almost all connections (using an iPhone SE) were very slow, hardly useable, and a small number lightening fast. Didn't seem matter which supplier. somewhat disappointing.",1
"Good package prices, easy to set up. Not helpful that customer service not available to contact.Signal is very poor too non existent in my area so often unable to use the phone which is a big issue and will be a real consideration come renewal.",1
easy to move to this mobile network - deal was in February and despite numerous emails and responses still no sign up deal voucher,1
Coverage not as good as I had hoped,1
"New to ID mobile after 4 business day of waiting for the sim card to arrive was offered £10.00 compensation which i accepted and then the chat person kept pushing saying the royal mail don't delivery on Saturdays and that l could travel to get a sim card from my local Currys which is 7 miles away. She would not confirm if l was indeed l was being charged for something l don't have yet, and then withdrew the offer of ten pounds as l requested to speak to her Manager and has now passed to the complaints team so l have to wait for a call back in the next three days. Totally dismissing my requests clearly totally disengaged from what she was supposed to be doing not reading my messages correctly  below is a snippet of our conversation :_ID Mobile 1st you say you accept the offer then you say you want the complaints team to contact you on ********* to speak to a real person.Me: I'm sorry who do you think you are talking tooMe: Maybe you should go back and read the conversation as you are clearly not ?Me: I accepted your offer and then you kept pushing and now we are here ?ID Mobile : To you since I'm not real enough for you I will be passing your complaint to our complaints team.Great customer service",1
"My only complaint is that the Internet connection is poor. Very bad, to be frank.",1
I still have problems pretty much everywhere to download data. It often takes a long time or just won’t do it. I will try for a bit longer for now…,1
Dislike being notified of over spend would like warning first,1
"Your ordering process is very poor - it does not explain that you can only order one sim card at a time.  You get an order confirmation and then a day or so later, get an email advising that you have been declined due to credit referencing.There is no contact number which allows you to speak to a human - it is all done through webchat which is very slowThe package is great, delivery (when the order actually goes through) is great, the set up/number porting is fine.I would also like to be able to have one account with several numbers and control them all through one account.",1
Internet coverage not great when outdoorsDon't like not being able to talk to customer service agent when I have a problem,1
The mobile data can be very slow at times.   The call quality is not as good as my old provider. Easy to understand app   Have used their customer service and it was good even though only online.  They do have calling customer service if you have special needs.,1
"Unfortunately my calls use to drop with 3 mobile, so they do the same with ID also as they piggyback off them",1
Often lose signal especially data but sometimes calls too. Tried restarting but no change. Was very frustrating .,1
I like the price of the tariff but I'm not that impressed with coverage quality and data speeds.,1
"The prices are great, especially compared with EE. However, iD Mobile uses Three's network and this seems very patchy and in certain places is unusable where other networks are ok.The most annoying feature though is the fact that you can only manage one SIM in the app. This makes no sense at all and just causes me problems. To check my spend etc on my family's 3 SIMs I have to log in to 3 separate accounts! This is a pointless irritation that could easily be fixed.Another plus is that even on my old-ish phone, Wifi Calling works! That's an excellent feature.",1
"Great price, patchy coverage (maybe it's where I live).. when out and about I'm often without a signal for an hour or so.I'm told ID piggybacks on Three.. wonder if their users report the same?",1
"Very poor signal coverage it seems most places I go especially anything outside of a major town. Whilst ID signal is 1 bar Vodafone on my work phone is 3 bars . It’s really frustrating even with 2 bars nothing loads up or takes forever whilst my work stuff is fine. Poor but cheap, take your pick.",1
everything is good apart from the coverage which is a bit pants in the south west,1
I struggle to get connections in a lot of places .. when my contract ends I will go back to EE unless it gets better,1
"iD offer very affordable pay monthly contracts, £26 for an iPhone 13 with unlimited data. The service is ok, I travel around the UK and the signal isn’t great in Leeds centre (data doesn’t work at all) or York along with other cities. Vodafone which was my last phone network was £15 more but suppose you get a much better signal and service if you pay that little bit more. The signal or data isn’t great with iD but if you need an affordable option then iD will do the job but it can also be frustrating when 30% of the time your calls might drop or you can’t use the internet.",1
"The deal given by ID mobile (June 2023) - Iphone 14 pro and good data was the best i found in the market. However, the connectivity and its network across the UK (where there is no 5G) was average to poor. Its a new network so i guess it may improve in the next few years but for now its slow in many parts of the country.",1
                                           Been with 02 since 2012.Signal was great same with 5g roll out  very rarely have zero signal. Data tracking is very easy on the o2 app. Overall as a company not bad unless you need to speak to customer service. Long time loyalty not rewarded. A friend who's been with 3 5 years gets deals for loyalty a friend on Vodafone gets great loyalty deals for renewing too.  O2 have pushed prices up and up and with annual contract price rises over their new 4 year contracts the showed for black Friday deals was far more than the 36 month currently Overall factoring total price of phone etc. It's almost like o2 currently are actively trying to get customers to leave. Prices are more than other providers and longer. 12 months to go then will be free of 02. The customer service team in the last 18 months have been appalling at best. Contacted them to pay off a contract when was made redundant and got told I don't owe anything again affirmed why and what I wanted to do to be told same again. Was unsuccessful. Sure that's borderline illegal to refuse to allow someone to pay off a contract in full when they have been made redundant and want to pay full balance.,1
"The O2 hosted Ginuwine and Tyrese yesterday, and they were absolutely incredible. They truly owned the stage with their energy and fresh presence. Their performances were polished, and their voices sounded just as amazing as they did in the ’90s—professional, nostalgic, and unforgettable.SWV also delivered a great set, and their talent shone through. That said, a small note to the O2: £15 for chicken and chips was a bit steep for the portion size!Tyrese is still as handsome as ever, and Ginuwine remains the epitome of charm and sexiness. Thank you for such an amazing performance. Honestly, they should’ve headlined the show—it was packed, and the crowd clearly loved them.However, it’s clear that so many people came to see Jodeci.

"Overall good service getting my new phone, network etc. Though the netwrok and connection is much better than Three so I'm not mad.I did nearly get scammed and hacked with a couple of weeks of moving to them, so very scary.And the case that I bought with it (iPhone 16 Pro Iceland Ultra D3O MagSafe Kick Phone Case) which has a ring/stand that just fell off in my hands after having it for about a month and a bit scared me. When I tried to complain about it I was told it wasn't covered and there wan't anything they could do. Don't buy that phone case and good luck!",1
"I recently had an issue with a new phone I had ordered. I don’t believe it was o2 responsible delivery issues, more so DPD. That being said the customer care wasn’t the best. It was hard to communicate the issue and I had to rehash it every time I called.That was until I spoke to an advisor call Kamarl. He was fantastic I would give him  5*, he spoke sense, followed up and was incredibly helpful. Unfortunately not all the call handlers were as helpful as him.",1
You need to sort out your inflation.I'm having to leave and rejoin just so I can get a better deal.Other networks fix their rate no increases.After 3 years you eventually end up paying 20% more than market rates for being a loyal customer.,1
I was wished a wishmas magic by text. Are you a bunch of witches druids and warlocks now 02?  Sort it out it's Christ's mass Jesus Christ.  Happy Christmas on the birth of Jesus our saviour. 🙏🏼,1
Plz again try to improve internet it bad try to maybe use vodafone network but tbh I love virgin,1
Instead of giving away free data to people why not reduce our contributions when all said and done your not giving anything your paying customers are.,1
"Advisors at 02 are very helpful, its only their tools with servicing calls and taking payments which let them down here.With text message, a receipt to confirm or summarize  the event which has happened through service may aid the customer with better experience.Also IVR needs to give customer time to select an option. Its a constant shambles for company that has good care with their customers.In waiting room, advise, caller what their position is and to offer a call-back.Also use emails to summarize call handling.GDPR Regulations followed with everyone.",1
"Ordering online is a nightmare from start to finish doing a Switch Up online.  Set the contact number on my order to the wrong number, and set the order up wrong with DPD, no one can help me get the PIN I need for delivery.  Not sure what I'm meant to do as I only get 14 days to return my old phone. No one will help on live chat or Phone keep blaming DPD when it is a known problem documented regularly on the 02 forum.However buying different item from in store the experience was totally different they couldn’t have been anymore helpful and kind.Don’t buy online go to a shop.",1
New customer here.So I ordered online the phone and airtime I wanted.Samsung s24 meh it'll do.Told delivery in 5 days. 5 days later still without a phone and no update.I ended up having a 1 hour phone call to see if I can get a different phone nope.I cancelled my entire order instead. No email stating out of stock. Could of saved me a lot of time.Operators tried to charge me £20 despite having £7 a month airtime on the previous order.Nope not happy.Giving 3 stars as the last person I spoke too was really nice.,1
I usually don't have any problems but I was a little concerned when I realised I couldn't activate my call waiting. I called O2 and they said prepaid customers don't get call waiting. Since when?! I'm pretty disappointed about this as call waiting shouldn't be an upgraded service and available to all. I will be looking to a new provider. There are some good deal out there at the moment,1
"over 2 weeks for customer service to get back to me .want an upgrade to a new phone , and want to stay with 02 , but 02 want £54 pound , another company can give me the phone i want with an 02 contract for £43 plus a £150 cash back .02 will not match , they are the same company .So thank you o2 for wanting to overcharge existing customers .i do have to say Laura at 02 customer service , wow great service , thank you , so now 3 stars instead of one , but if they helped in the first place we wouldnt of had to write a review",1
"I am, as I start to write, hanging on to the 02 customer service, having spent hours going around in circles through the menus on their website trying to cancel a Disney+ add-on that I've never been able to access and am now being charged for.However, eventually Rohit restored my faith by sorting the cancellation and giving me a better phone deal.I give 1 star to the frustrating website but 5 stars to Rohit.",1
"I was switched from Virgin Media to 02 some years ago on a monthly plan paid by Direct Debit. My experience has been fine but, today, out of the blue, I took a call from 02. The man apparently wanted to know if I had any complaints. My only complaint was that I did not want such uninvited calls at inconvenient moments. I did not understand why he was calling so I looked at Trustpilot. I am shocked at all the recent complaints. I have had no reason to call 02 but these complaints do make me concerned about the company and the difficulty sorting out an issue were it to arise.",1
"Calling 202 for assistance is pretty awful. Long waiting times that normally result in you just being cut off and having to start again. At one point I had been on the phone to an agent for 10 mins and was actually making progress, just to be hung up on unexpectedly with no call back. I later learned that Carlo the agent had not actioned anything we were discussing.The online chat service is considerably better, wait times are not as long as calling and the agents seem more willing and able to help. Thanks Rupali!",1
"The wait to be answered was over 16 minutes and the whole time I was waiting I was assaulted with hideous music, that actually hurt! Their were very high pitched notes that drilled into my brain, alongside loud static, which caused me to wince.Before the horrendous noise I had to explain myself multiple times to the automated system which kept interrupting me.Once I got through, the operator was helpful and able to help me with half of my problem. The other half will have to wait for my call back tomorrow by a different team. At least there won't be any so called music!",1
"It's been ok.When I was transferred to O2 from my previous mobile phone provider both the O2 website and app were down, this was really annoying.The high number of messages and emails about my billing is annoying, also the app keeps asking me for an additional pin whenever I open it.On the plus side, the network has proved fairly reliable and fast, and the price is good.",1
"My contract with O2 has just come to an end. They have been my provider for many years, even decades. My monthly payment has just increased approximately £2.00 to about £13.00 a month for 4GB of data so I will be moving provider very soon. If I renew my contract with O2 it is a minimum of 24 months for the same deal except you get an extra 2GB a month for approximately £11.00 per month. So an understanding why customers change providers.",1
"Thanks to the O2 customer service team and special thanks to Mr. Shadley who has resolved my device Samsung A 52 S . It was suddenly an unknown cause of a dark screen problem, and he gave the solution with an alternative backup, I had an old iPhone 6 plus. He has connected the O2 services to it. I have been trying to contact last two days, approximately 7 hours of trying, I became very upset with the O2 customer service team, however Once Mr Shadley gave person-centered care cordially and resolved the issues, I appreciated his help. My name is Mohammad Shahjahan My O2 contact is 07941366457. I was really impressed by his help.",1
"I can't say I am completely unhappy about this company, as going to Europe without having to worry about data is a good plus. Network coverage isn't bad too. However:1-Once you sign a 12 or 18 contract with them, be prepared to pay more for what they offer to new customers if you compare the rates2-They constantly increase the rates, more than other companies3-Customer service average chat: after the bot shuts your chat in your face several times ""because we are very busy"", if you manage to talk to someone be prepared for 20 minutes of security questions, agents handling maybe 20 cases at the same time, ignoring the request,  and giving you random answers - totally useless",1
"i responded to their ""amazing unrepeatable once in a lifetime"" offer. It includes a tradin, and u get £100 off on deal, but when you ACTUALLY push the buttons it's £14.40 on the telly, I did it twice before giving up and chatting to the helpful lady in South Ifrica who alleged that it's £100 from 02 added to my account, and £14 from the recycling shower. But they can't actually show that anywhere on their webshite. Nowhere do you get a screen showing the Whole Deal, BEFORE you actually place the order.But all software is same - written by spotty kids in dark rooms, never tested on real people in the real world.",1
To cut this saga short my number was 'transferred' from my previous mobile airtime supplier.only not all of the relevant files were transferred to O2.After my number was 'transferred' I found that I could only ring out to anyone but initially no one could call me.Eventually we established that only a person using an O2 sim could call me but  no one else.No one at O2 was able to help resolve the problem.I have updated this review as I received a call from O2 explaining what had happened.My old number is now working with my new telephone company.,1
"I have been with O2 for over 15 years. Never had a major issue.However, this network unfortunately took a very sentimental thing from me. In Dec 2021 my Grandad died and had left me a voicemail a few days prior. I know I did not delete this. Even though the message was SAVED, I have never been able to retrieve it - it was deleted. They have since changed their VM service to need a confirmation to cancel VMs. I had also noticed various other of my personal VMs deleted around the same time. I know this is subjective to me, but that VM is something I will never be able to get back. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",1
"I have been an O2 customer (through affiliates such as Carphone Warehouse or direct) since June 2004. There were two good things about this network provider, for my personal experiences: Customer Service and Signal Quality. Even though the CS hasn’t waned for me yet, the Signal Quality has been shocking compared to their recent speeds. In 2014, I first got 4G in my area @ 68Mbps. Now it’s 2023 and I’m averaging around 4Mbps if I’m lucky. Naturally, the jargon spewed will be about number of users in the area but that’s nonsense as the city centre has speeds of around 160Mbps for 4G. In a pandemic and post-pandemic era, this is absolutely below par for modern mobile network expectations and delivery. Please sort it out.",1
"Been with O2 for over 15 years, had good and bad, only grip is signal coverage, it’s rubbish drop out quite often and Data going from a rare 5G to 4G that just about works",1
I've been with o2 for many years and never had a single problem.On the other hand I've ordered a phone this morning for same day click and collect and still haven't got a single email that the collection is available.Might seem like a small gripe but you shouldn't have that on the website if the same day collection is not processed by the end of the day.If I didn't mind waiting I would've ordered the next day delivery.,1
"Tried to call O2 to expedite PAC code processing for number transfer to new O2 SIM to unlock Virgin Media + 02 Volt benefits. First few attempts to call 202 just failed or disconnected following a number of rings. Eventually got into a queue with a warning of 45 minute wait. Spent a long time listening to super low bitrate hold music.When I eventually spoke to someone, they confirmed the schedule for number migration + were able to associate my Virgin Media account with my O2 account to secure Volt benefits (double minutes + US roaming).",1
"OK, but not great. Query about changing pin code for sim card resulted in ‘please go to o2 shop’. Quite difficult (language problems) to have a meaningful conversation with o2 agent.",1
Service is normally decent but the overall performance of the network has declined so badly over the years. They do allow 25GB of roaming in EU so that helps. Prices aren’t as competitive as they used to be.,1
I joined o2 in June 2022 on a 12 month contract. In April 2023 the price of my contracted increased 17.25% from £8 to £9.38. A whopping £16.56 per annum.I called customer retentions on Fri 9th Jun and had to wait in a queue for about 14 mins.The analyst took my details but didn't sound enthusiastic about his job. The analyst placed me on hold for to look for a deal. After 12 minutes they hung up.I called back with similar wait times. The analyst initially only offered uncompetitive rates at a higher cost. I said I wanted the rate given to new customers. On directing him to the moneysavingexpert website he agreed to match the 30GB SIM for £8.Now upgraded my review from 1 to 3 stars.,1
After a stressful change with 02 from EEOver 10 calls to customer service and a visit to Wilmslow store Kersty Jones managed to sort out my husbands phone.  In my opinion this girl needs a pay rise or get her to train all your staff.  Thank you Kersty for helping us ♥️,1
I am waiting on them to fix something. Not too bad in general where I live but they are telling me a mast broken meaning I do not receive/ cannot make calls is not their problem. This may well become a 1 star review if they do not pull their socks up,1
"Wish I had read the reviews before starting a contract. Was very happy with GiffGaff for 10 years but they don’t offer Apple Watch mobile service so I switched. A disaster from the start, they set me up with two separate numbers for some reason and two months later still am unable to activate my watch after more than a dozen calls. The customer support is disheartening — they know next to nothing about the issue, tried to get me off the phone by saying they will call back and if they do, they hang up right away. Worst company I have ever encountered.EDIT: After several more attempts I was eventually contacted by Robert who gave a solution — I needed to update my phone number in iPhone settings (it won’t happen automatically with a SIM only plan) and do a SIM swap to try again. It worked. He also offered to follow up. The issue is a lack of knowledge across call centres but I eventually did get the help I needed and am updating my score to reflect that.",1
"Mixed experience where one customer advisor was either inexperienced or trying to dishonourable keep me in contract despite explaining as on refresh wanted to cancel the monthly rolling contract for one of my numbers with phoned returned in period. He said I can.choose to believe him or not but I knew he was wrong so ended call and rang back to get a really helpful adviser who came across as helpful, knowledgeable and listening to what I was wanting. I put it down to questionable training and development if two advisors could be poles apart. Just wish at end of call it asked you to rate your experience on keypad as one would get 0 out of 5 and the next 5 out of 5.",1
"Spoke to a wonderful women Laneez. She was extremely poilet, going above and beyond to help with my issue!! I’ve had an ongoing data issue which is why I’m rating low, however my experience with Laneez was great, she was very helpful and reassuring. Completely taking ownership of the problem.",1
Good deal when moving to O2 from Vodafone but signal cuts out quiet abit & very often sounds like we’re talking under water.I’ll see how it goes for the remainder of the contract,1
Disappointing data speeds (4G or 5G) and sometimes really poor signals when compared to my VF or EE numbers. I'm only keeping this contract as O2's roaming offer outside EU is better than the others and the offers in Priority app are usually decent.,1
"Good intentions and really friendly staff, but it just takes an absolute age to do anything.2 x 40 minute phone calls to change a small detail regarding my direct debit.Should be faster",1
Hannah from payments team was super helpful and went through a lot of solutions for my issue with me. 5 stars for Hannah but 1 star for o2 the money hungry company that actively makes it difficult to open complaints on purpose,1
"I have been moved over from Virgin to O2 on a sim only contract. Great coverage and a good price too but I am fed up of the constant messages from O2 about my usage, bills due to be paid, bills paid, DD requested etc. I get more messages from them than my best friend.",1
"I have mine and my husband's contacts on O2 with them getting £85 a month from us. I've always paid early and sometimes overpaid.I'm trying to cancel my husband's contract that has ended. He has a new phone and new network as there is no incentive to stay with O2 - less perks, most perks located in London, and it was more expensive to upgrade with O2 after being a loyal customer for many years than get a new contact elsewhere.I can't request a PAC code through SMS, I can't request one through My O2 account and I can't cancel the contract through My O2 either. I was waiting to talk to a chat agent for over 30 mins to then having to wait another 15 mins after my first message to then be sent to wait for another chat agent for no apparent reason. They told me to go through My O2 account then disconnected. I've heard about all the people being on hold for hours after calling 202, so I have no clue how I'm supposed to cancel our contracts!Edit - I can say there is at least one decent person at O2. My last resort was to send a message through Facebook and I was finally able to get my issue sorted. All the stars just for them!",1
"Appeared to have been overcharged, a lost mobile being replaced in an O2 shop and probably incorrectly set up by staff in the shop, to access an unneeded ""wifi"" signal ?.  O2 proved difficult to contact, both online & by mobile, but on contact, the operator was very helpful, arranging a probable refund and polite throughout.  Line was exceptionally poor, I presume due to the location I'd had to take the phone call in.  Apologies to operator for any annoyance on my part",1
"I have had good service and been a long time with O2 for years, even the few years I was with Giff gaff (also O2 network). I like the priority offers although I don't use them as much as I used to. Since they have had a mast down near Chester, the coverage has become atrocious. I'm not able to have proper voice calls in my flat. I have had to resort to my landline which thankfully I still have but costs me to use.",1
"O2 is just okay-ish. I have been with them, SIM Only customer, for 2 years but I decided to port away to another network after getting tired of not being able to properly use mobile data when I'm out and about.It's okay for general web-browsing but anything more data-heavy in most locations and it will struggle a lot compared to the other networks. 5G on O2 is often slower than 4G, or even 3G, elsewhere.Coverage is its strength and is on par with the leader EE and in some places will beat it. The service options available, like VoLTE, VoWifi, eSim, etc. are quite similar to the competition but the implementation can sometimes seem a bit shaky.O2 Priority is probably the best reward system alongside Vodafone Very Me but it's hardly a thing I can't live without.Offers good value for money, if comparison or cashback sites are used, and it's the only main network that has EU roaming included on all plans and with a generous 25GB limit. The Volt benefits, double data and free roaming in extra locations is a nice extra.My experience with Customer Service has been sporadic but has been between okay and good, apart from one time when I couldn't correctly contact them for a whole weekend about a billing issue.If you are looking for a network for calls, texts and basic data it can be a good choice. If you need something more on the data-side then look elsewhere.",1
"I had a highly disappointing experience with O2 as my network provider. They consistently overcharged me, billing me more than my selected tariff, even after I canceled my O2 account and informed them about it. Their customer service was abysmal, with excruciatingly long wait times on the phone. Overall, I found their billing system and customer service to be a nightmare. My experience with O2 left me thoroughly frustrated and disappointed.",1
After trying for 2 days I eventually got a real person to talk to and managed to sort my contract. Absolutely impossible to do on the app as kept saying my password was incorrect which it wasn't.,1
"I bought a Samsung Z Fold 5 on 7 Aug 2023 through O2 and they had an offer to buy ear buds worth £219 for £1. I have contacted 02 customer service to claim this offer and was told I should receive a code after 30days from date of purchase. I was told to contact them after 5th September if code had not been  received. I called on 6th September and was told a form had been completed and was to expect the code within 48hours.I still didn't get the code and after a few days I called again. This time I was referred to Samsung but Samsung advised that this was an O2 offer and the code was meant to come from O2. I called 02 again and was promised that the code would be send.Today it's 10th October, I still haven't heard from O2.",1
"I`m on pay and go. They used to be good but now, their coverage is shockingly bad. Hardly any signal, and poor mobile data connection and speed",1
"No problem with service, however at end of my contract when I'd paid for my phone they thought they could still charge me for it. They are now my ex provider",1
The stars are for Ashley at O2 in Solihull who finally sorted our problem below!He was very professional while other colleagues in the shop kept being exasperated while saying customer services are rubbish and then saying we have a new system no one knows how to use and left it at that.Customer services on the phone were absolutely awful - has taken so many months to activate the virgin media O2 deal because our data was inputted incorrectly and created duplicate accounts! Customer service either had no clue virgin media was pairing with O2 or kept transferring you to people all equally as unhelpful.Ashley finally sorted it for us!,1
"Credit where credit is due 02 are actually doing something about the issues with the handset and all is getting sorted thanks you 02And yet another 5 hours and 20 minutes over two days of time to 02 customer service with no help. My problem is I have missed my bill this month but 02 cannot do anything about it ok it's my fault for missing the payment all I asked for was a extension of time in which I got refused.........I have been suffering with 02 no service for just over 6 months due to masts being down as they informed me there is nothing that they can do because it's in my small print in a contract I signed.It basically started that if 02 are down it's my problem because they don't actually have to provide a service lol but I pay for a service, that I'm not actually receiving. I asked for a extension of time (as I have bared with them) to make the payment but no they are unable to help.Anyone who is reading this please do research and go with a better network provider if you fall in the same category as me they won't help you with a service or help with payment.",1
"I have had the same mobile number since 1994, I have been an O2 customer since it was BT Cellnet (Yes, I am that old). They really need to do better at customer relations, they are abysmal, and now, 5G, what a joke that is, I have had to restrict my phone to 4G to ensure a signal, on 5G is is like using dial up modems again. I was once an engineer working on the O2 cell towers, they used to have a decent power output - they don't now, of all the cell providers in the UK, their towers have the lowest output of the lot - and that is purely to save money on electricity costs, certianly not provide an adequate service for customers - and I use the adjective Adequate advisadly...I cannot, in all conscience recommend them, and when my contract is up I will finally transfer to a new provider - I haven't until now through laziness on my part, but enough is enough.",1
"My phone was stolen on Monday and O2 immediately blocked my number which was amazing. Thank you O2 for working so quickly.I went into store to get a new sim but since I’m on my Dad’s plan for multi sim discount, I wasn’t allowed to do ANYTHING, despite my name being attached to my number and since my dad is in a different city, I travelled there to go into a store to get my sim. Unfortunately they didn’t check whether my number had been blocked in store and it turns out my number had been double barred (whatever that means) which meant I will not have had a connection to the O2 network for nearly 48 hours instead of the usual 24 hours. The customer service assistant did apologise for this, which I appreciate but it would have been so much easier if O2 would allow authorised contacts instead of only talking to the account holder because I would have been able to solve it much, much earlier and also get my sim earlier.Please O2, allow authorised contacts so that this doesn’t inconvenience people in the future.",1
"The performance of O2 SIM's card varies - some days it works well, while other days it doesn't work as well.",1
"O2 the guys in your shops are fantastic but sadly I can’t get onto the shop when I’m working so sadly have to call customer services. Please please please O2 start employing some English speaking staff, the last three times I have had to call you guys I have had to repeat myself over and over again it’s sooooo frustrating and must be hard for the call centre guys too, I also don’t have time to spend half an hour on the phone for something that should be done in 5 minutes without the language barrier… honestly really thinking of getting rid of O2",1
"O2 can either be very good or very poor. For example they sent me a phone case I didn't order and charged me for it.It really depends on the advisor, some are very knowledgeable and helpful. While some are not.",1
Im not happy with the ssrvice 02 provides i never have any signal it doesnt matter where i am i have never got beyond a joke as my job consists of traveling alot and i live in a city!,1
"I upgraded to the z fold 3 don't get me wrong it came after being delivered to a different address. Quite disappointed that it didn't come with a plug since the charger isn't a USB end, no screen protectors, no headphones when you buy cheaper phones you get the lot so why not the same with the newer phones. It definitely should come with at least a plug for the charger.",1
"The prices are cheap, but the quality and speed are terrible. You get what you pay for..",1
"I’ve been saddled with O2 by Virgin. Out of the 3 mobile numbers registered on Virgin Family plan 1 number was transferred to O2 and is visible on MyO2 app and the other 2 numbers were transferred to O2 but are parked somewhere on the system. I have no access to them via O2 app and so can’t manage spend, allowances etc. but O2 are still dutifully charging me for them. After about 6 months of on-off chasing O2 unsuccessfully to merge 3 numbers on my account I got fed up and told them to stuff it. The customer service was 50/50, some tried to help but had no idea how, others were incompetent and rude. Then I discovered that Virgin tied me into O2 via their Volt package and if I ditch O2 then my Virgin broadband doubles in price. After another few hours of my life on the phone to Virgin and O2 that I’ll never get back Virgin told me they managed to remove O2 ‘benefit’ from my Volt package and keep my discount and I can now cancel O2. Virgin phoned O2 themselves and then transferred me through to get PAC codes for the 3 numbers I wanted to move out of O2. This time I finally got through to somebody with brains in the UK call center. They explained how to set up alternative account for my other 2 numbers and couldn’t have been more helpful and knowledgeable and managed to persuade me to stay with O2 for another 12 months by taking a third off my bill.  Maybe Virgin have access to better level of O2 customer service because whenever I phoned O2 directly I ended up speaking to somebody in overseas call centers with poor English and wrong attitude.Anyway, my overall rating is 3 stars: I did get what I wanted (access to other 2 numbers and reduced contract cost) but customer service is very poor and transfer from Virgin to O2 was crap.",1
"My overall experience with O2 has been mixed. There is no other way to describe it.Let's start off with the positives.I have what I would call an unbeatable deal from O2 thanks to the Virgin Mobile migration. My phone bill is £6.79/mo for completely unlimited data (on VM, it was for 2GB, plan price was originally 2GB for a 12 month contract in 08/2018), which no other network would ever be able to beat. I currently use around 40GB in a month, which is a stark contrast to never using over 4GB in a month for 5 years. Granted my usage habits have changed now that I'm free to burn my data.Through the Virgin Mobile migration, I also gained the ability to use 4G calling and WiFi calling (yes Virgin did have the ability for both, but it just would have been a pain to set up) from the moment I migrated. Unfortunately, these features did disappear for a long time (from about July to mid-December) which sucks. I don't make calls often but both options make calls crystal clear and reliable.A bit after mid-November, I decided to get a SIM swap with O2, since I was still using my old Virgin SIM (which was originally programmed to connect to the EE network, still have remnants of that even with my new O2 SIM with the T-Mobile MNC seemingly reporting ""Virgin Mobile"" when manually searching for networks). The SIM swap processed extremely quickly with being delivered within just 2 days (one day after my order confirmation), which was a stark contrast from the experience that I had with moving someone from Plusnet to EE (SIM took 4 days to deliver and EE didn't even send confirmation details).Priority is a cool plus to have and getting Volt features is nice too.Now the negatives.With the migration, I was promised the visual voicemail feature on my Android phone, but it has yet to work for me. I've had a tab for it appear once, but that's it.On Virgin, RCS always worked perfectly fine. Meanwhile on O2, I've had a few problems (particularly by the migration from O2's RCS to Jibe RCS) and it's left me unable to use RCS.I'd like to finally end this off with a concern I have for the future as an O2 customer. Due to the way that O2 migrated Virgin customers, my tariff price is £13.29 with a £6.50 discount bolt-on. I am concerned that the annual price increases will cost more on O2 than it would of on Virgin due to the way that the migration was handled.",1
Too expensive but stuck with them since they took over from Virgin mobile,1
Decent network been with them years. Never had any major issues,1
Moved from Vodafone hoping for better network.Absolutely rubbish! Do better O2,1
"I don't really have any issues with O2, have been a customer for many years, I do however think they can improve by using another delivery company instead of DHL Parcels UK, I was offered next day delivery by O2 for my upgrade. Still no sign, should of been delivered 31/10/22. Seems I'm not the only one having problems. O2 needs to get a reliable delivery company not fraudsters.",1
"As of the time of writing this review, one of our contracts has been canceled, and we're hoping it stays that way. Prior to this, my family had three contracts: one for myself, one for my dad, and one for my little brother. My dad and I had a generally positive experience with our contracts, with only occasional internet signal issues, which were infrequent and didn't significantly affect our overall satisfaction.Now, let's delve into the canceled contract concerning my little brother. Approximately two months ago, he temporarily lost his phone, but he managed to retrieve it the following day. On the day the phone was lost, we promptly contacted the service provider to report it and have the number barred. We were informed that we'd need to wait for 24 hours for the bar to be lifted, which we accepted. However, for the following three days, my brother couldn't make calls or use data. We reached out to customer support, only to be advised that switching SIM cards would be quicker. We visited the first store in Wembley, but my brother failed to answer the security questions and lacked the required identification, which, understandably, the store couldn't overlook.We then tried another store in Edgware while I was taking care of my car. We brought two forms of ID and proof of billing, and requested a new SIM card. However, we faced the same issue with security questions and ID verification. The system seemed to have a glitch in specifying which security question to answer. We contacted the service provider, and it turned out that my brother had two security questions and answers, and the system wasn't clear on which one to use. Despite answering correctly, the issue persisted.After trying to resolve the problem for several days, including obtaining multiple SIM cards and switching to different phones, we realized the problem wasn't with the SIM but likely linked to my brother's account. The service provider promised to investigate, but after a week, they requested another week to continue their inquiry. Keep in mind that we made repeated calls during this process, and sometimes the support team didn't have the necessary information, forcing us to provide it repeatedly.After waiting for over a month and a half with no resolution in sight, we decided to cancel the contract. Fortunately, we were given credit, so we didn't have to pay, but it became apparent that having a contract was pointless if we couldn't use the SIM. Interestingly, we switched to Giffgaff, which operates on the same network as our previous provider (O2), using the PAC code for our number, and everything worked perfectly. As such, I don't expect a cancellation bill, as I left the contract due to the absence of service, which should be evident in their records. It appears that my account was disabled at the time of writing this review.",1
Transferred over from virgin to o2 definitely an improvement over virgin mobile network has a smoother experience coverage is great at my home very poor at my work but this service is very cheap compared to the competitors seems to be better than my experience with o2 two years ago,1
O2used to be good until thay merged with virgin media,1
"I have changed the provider for 02, not quit what I expected ...",1
Good service all round. But I think advisors need to explain certain terms of deals such as O2 Switch Up. The problem is it’s being advertised as upgrade your phone whenever you want from the day you to take the contract. But actually it’s after 14 days of purchase. Falsely advertised.,1
"Customer for 5+ years and the experience goes down every time I roll off a contract. Coverage and features of the service, generally very good. Customer service and the transparency of billing and switching, terrible. Really struggle to get the best deal, and billing transparency is next to nothing when there's a change - email updates do tell you what it's going to be, but not why (or even if) there's a change.",1
Mobile phone providers are all pants lets face it however O2 have impressed me by now auto moving you to SIM only once handset is paid off not like the rest who just take the extra profit until you realise or pushing upgrade onto you - reception could be better!,1
The service in the cinema for popcorn and drinks is abysmal. 10 mins per customer. Never seen anything like it,1
"I have been a loyal 02 custome for over ten years. Yesterday I wanted an additional contract for my 14yrs old son. I spoke to a gentleman called Tom. He was very helpful and professional. As we were about to complete the deal the system went down and he could not proceed. He apologised and kindly asked me to call back today. I called back this morning. I was holding on for over 30 minutes just to speak to someone who was inpatient, not will to help and would not give consideration to the conversation I had with her colleague the previous day. So I had to choice but to contact another provider for a new contract for my son. I'm really disappointed and would not be renewing my contract with 02 when it expires",1
Download speed is mostly ok but upload speed is useless max I have seen is between a shocking 0.1mbps to Max of 10mbps sure this service is cheaper than Vodafone and EE but have to remember that you get what you pay for customer service not good either you will be waiting over 30 minutes to speak with someone and there is no function like Vodafone to receive your call back in turn I have just moved to this network it is cheaper but service is so so,1
"Website is awful. PAYG top up won't allow you to paste a credit card number in, then moans you have typed the number in wrong. Wouldn't be an issue if you would allow the number to be pasted in!Then there is no way of contacting them to provide feedback on this, even the complaints service is hidden behind some live chat thing, just want an email address at least. Not hard really.The irony of this review is the notification box at the bottom is the only place I have spotted an email address for O2!",1
"Been with O2 for about 10 years and honestly they're average as far as phone networks go, like I've never actually had much issue with the network itself but I will say if you go anywhere out of London your signal will defo suffer as oppose to being inside of London. I'm planning on leaving O2 soon not for the network coverage but the price of paying off a phone, my family have always been with O2 and me and my dad have always gotten our phones from O2 but as I've gotten older I've realised how much you overpay, and it stems mostly from paying your for your phone over a long period, I currently have an IPhone 12 and got it from O2 and honestly really regret it. The problem with paying off Phones is the fact that they go down in value from year to year, so I've now given O2 around 600+ pounds for a phone in present day it's worth about 200, used which is insane, obviously tech does do go down in value as it gets older but wow a 400 pound loss is very bad especially cause eventually I am planning on selling it and buying a newer phone, there's also the sim costs which are completely overpriced and stupid O2 seems to have a minimum that they want you to pay cause in some cases 8gb of mobile data will be the same as 4gb in price and will go down very little in value which isn't good if your attempting to save money by cutting off data that's not in use, there's also no incentive anymore for me to stay on the same network as my family or people I talk to as lowered pricing for texting and calling for people on the same network really don't exist anymore as most people are on unlimited contracts as it's literally cheaper. I'm mostly likely going to be switching to a lesser known network which picky backs off of the Three network like Smarty or Honest Mobile due to their less expensive and non contract nature and saying goodbye to O2 cause it's wayyy to expensive to justify using. Thanks.",1
I had £10 PAYG bundle and I think o2 a very good reliable network but have they still got that really silly voice message at the start of every call you make that says 'BUNDLE CALL' nobody's going to want to hear that when using phone. This has gone on for years and no other network payg make you go through this annoying garbage. Grow up o2. Unless they do it to force you to get sim only contract. Will be going vodafone with no silly messages before voice call.,1
Been with these guys for a third of my life and they have been top notch for years. I have had issues with them every so often but never like this one recently which has made them loose two stars. I had issues with my signal as a mast went down near by and it took them over a month to sort it out. My work was heavily affected by this and I never got any compensation from them. As a loyal customer I expected better service...,1
"I rarely feel motivated to review a company that is neither wonderful or dreadful, so my reviews tend to be all or nothing.  Here's is a company I really have no strong feelings about.  It's reasonably cheap, the calls work fine, and there are rarely outages, but the website is a pain in the behind.  I can't honestly recommend them, but nor can I be bothered to leave them.",1
"I suffered  a delay for the transfer of my previous phone number to the O2 SIM.   The online support was not at all useful but when I was eventually able to talk to an O2 human, she was polite, efficient and helpful.O2 owners and managers should not believe that their IT systems will ever be as good for their customers as  a human agent.   Only the simple queries can be properly dealt with via their support line.",1
"4G signal is terrible considering that they have low bands, 3G signal is great but when you're getting 1.4Mbps down and 0.6Mbps up its pretty useless and even when 4G signal is good the best I get is 5.7Mbps down and 0.1Mbps up. Avoid. I left Three for these and shouldn't have bothered.Now down to one star, numerous reports about the network issues, many texts saying work is happening in the area only to find no improvements what so ever.Offered a reduced package which I am happy with (less data), since now I've taken out broadband. Customer service on this occasion was actually spectacular!",1
"Overall Average, their contracts are sometimes a little expensive for what you get, live chat experts half the time can’t answer your question which slows things down, Connectivity is average not the fastest speeds slow at times. Just a very basic and average experience overall. Not sure if I’d recommend O2.",1
"I got lucky on 2nd attempt and the lady was very very professional. But the first person was an animal. As a NHS worker feeling the strain I understand why, but that doesn't make it acceptable. I have spent several years in NHS and also in the Financial sector prior to that and treat people as I wanted to be treated. So o2 either you working your staff to hard and need to sort your capacity or you need to give some vial people the boot",1
"My husband needed a new phone, so went to Worthing O2 shop. Service couldn’t have been better (5 stars for them!!) , in that they were really busy, so very nice guy in there took phone number and said that he would ring when an advisor was free, to save hanging around in the shop. We were then dealt with by Victoria, who could not have been nicer or more helpful. HOWEVER - I then tried to contact O2 Customer Services to compliment the Worthing shop. Ended up completely defeated by impenetrable system (NO stars for them!!) - maybe I won’t change my phone to O2 after all…..",1
"I've been a SIM-only customer for a year, which I got at a fairly good price (20GB for £21). It's a good price (considering it's O2), but the coverage is not what I remember of O2 to have before. It's been pretty disappointing, especially when commuting, and making me consider switching to other providers when my contract is up.",1
"Called up to cancel an airtime plan which I no longer had a use for. Initially I was advised that I could not pass security and therefore could not cancel this, I then spoke with someone else, went through security fine (my answers had not changed) and have managed to get the matter resolved. I really do wonder what nincompoops get employed here at times!",1
I’ve always been a bit of a fan of the O2 but when they tried to Renew my car insurance with a card which was obviously out of date and then charge me £20 to renew it I think this is less than business like they have charged me now the £20 saying it was my fault that I didn’t give them an update on the card,1
I have recently left O2 having been with them for a good few years.It has been noticeable that whilst away from the home the service has been poor with O2 having no connection whilst my family who use other providers have had a signal.Although the coverage was poor I have to say that customer service was excellent every time I contacted them.,1
"Moved from EE and had nothing but hassle from day one, luckily still within 14 day cancellation period and it's headed that way. Feels like they want to blame customers for issues and once signed up are no longer interested in you.i have given 2 stars as expecting a call today to get resolution but it should be one or less,doubt it will happen and if not I will be returning their phone and cancelling my contract...O2 came back and resolved the issue, was just a bad store experience.",1
Ordered a Samsung Gear VR from the o2 shop. The check out was very painful and i had to key details multiple times before it eventually went through. If another supplier had of had stock i would gone elsewhere. Pre sale experience 1 Star.Item however arrived next day with a fully tracked service and the after purchase experience was 5 star so overall 3 stars from me.,1
"I""ve found that  when I contact O2   via the phone usually good service, but go to a branch and you""re lucky to find someone who knows what they""re talking about.Had a terrible experience at Brentwood where the assistant suddenly ran off with my debit card and made a copy of it--I managed to get photocopy destroyed. All she kept asking me was I happy with the ""service""!!! she gave.  NO I WASN""T.",1
"Ok customer service used to be soo much better. Certainly better than the other competitors. I have had a contract with these guys for over 15 years now. They used to be so good in retaining customers, however lately I don't think they care anymore. They are definitely the most expensive network out there. I would recommend go via carphone warehouse if you want an O2 upgrade or contract. The same tariff at carphone for O2 will be cheaper than actually going direct with O2. I know you'd think it would be the opposite.",1
"I've been with O2 10+ years and have an iPhone with them, so far so good in most respects. Apart from one, and it's so bizarre I find it almost unforgiveable for a mobile company. They text you your bill and in the text is a web address to manage your account. Click on that link though, and you go through to a site optimised for desktop users only. Not mobile users. Um what does this company do again:)?",1
Been with O2 (and previously BT Cellnet) for over 10 years now. Signal is always very good but recently the cost of being with this network vs other is terrible. I have NEVER been rewarded for contract renewals and by renewing an iPhone contract with them as opposed to moving network I am actually WORSE off.When phoning problems I get transferred from here to there and spend hours holding. Disappointing.,1
"Even after the cost of the 'free phones' was covered, they kept taking those rentals for year after year, without ever once informing me that, maybe, just maybe, I was not getting a fair bill for the one or two calls that I made per month. Just kept on taking the money.That is, until I wised up. And I would probably slill be  paying, except that they got greedy!!!!!!",1
"Variable service, not the phones but the company.  Sme issues sorted out really quickly, some things can take months.  I have a £10/month contract with mins, free texts and a good phone, which is well cheap.  Broadband and webmail problems have taken a very long time to sort out in the past though.  In short a good value product as well as you dont get faults.",1
"It seems o2 are very good at training their staff to turn every inquiry or question into a sales opportunity. Instead of providing a real sense of concern about a question they pitch you. This has happened more than once, but not always. When it does happen and I hear the pitch about this or that I get quite cross. I can say I have found their prices competitive and would not be inclined to switch ...unless I loose it next time they start blabbing at me.",1
"Hit and miss. Staff in franchise stores are clearly less regulated than the company itselfs employees, having contacted O2 with many issues, their complaints team have handled them remarkably. I would love to see a little more loyalty to customers like me on upgrades, and also a few less issues in the first place.",1
I have stuck with o2 since it was btcellnet and my current contract is my last. I don't like them increasing my bill every year no matter how little they say it is and I don't like a £3 late payment charge. O2 used to be about me but now it's all about the money. Shame on you O2 you could be so much more!,1
"Fair contract prices, but website as a bit confusing(used u switch to review packages and prices for SIM only contracts) on line order was fairly easy, although my number port authorisation ws slightly delayed and only way to contact was live webchat, which wasn't easy with overseas workers and some parts of the communication were lost in translation, although they did try their best and got things back on track. Using the O2 app for billing, info etc.  All in all, I'm finding O2 okay as it stands and nothing particularly poor to report-long may this continue.",1
"This is a difficult one to write because I spent a couple of days not getting anywhere and was really annoyed , I read the bad reviews and that made me angrier and I felt they were giving me the runaround . I eventually managed to speak to a person ( 3 in all) and they were so helpful it made my bad robot experience fade and my problem is now sorted . Why do large companies insist on these awful press 1 - 6 choices and then after hours of trying not getting anyone . ..... Thankyou humans for being so helpful but decision makers get rid of the robot answer machines .",1
"I switched to o2 from Virgin Mobile after I noticed a new o2 mast on Lytton Way in Stevenage about 400 yards from me in autumn 2020.  Using only 4G at the moment I regularly get 150 meg down but only get 4 meg up and pings over 35 ms which is not ideal as my internet radio cuts out regularly but streaming HD video is fine.In June 2021 I noticed that 5G was available from Three in my area so I tried iD Mobile.  Wow, what a difference, 275 down, a whopping 60 up and pings of 16 ms.  Internet radio has never been better and streaming 4K video is faultless.  Sorry o2, I'm gone for good.",1
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years now and I am always on simplicity tariff as I cant have any good deals from o2 .Thinking many times to leave this provider .. I called the customer service centre to see if they have good deal for loyal customers .I found nothing worth buying new contract from them as they are more expensive than other providers,disappointed totally  .I hope they review their prices  policy especially  towards their loyal customers .Thank you",1
I haven’t had internet on my phone since getting my new sim. I called 3 weeks prior spoke two 2 people that hadn’t a clue and one that was very rude. Got told I she would call back that day she didn’t so I had to ring back up and was on hold for half an hour. I then was meant to have 24 hr call back 3 weeks later I get a pop up saying my 4g no longer working on my account and still no internet. I rang up this morning and spoke to a lady called Cheryl where she was 3 weeks ago I don’t Know the Only person to actually solve my problem and was so lovely. 5 star service to Cheryl for helping me.,1
HelloBeen with O2 in total 8 years and never had a problem untill 3g came into use its really bad and once again local masts are over crowded with too many ppl using there data ....Only reason i stayed was because of there customer services always have tried to help but untill there 3g network dont improve goodbye O2..Plus the rpi every year they raise ur monthly bill which is total nonsenseIf ur making money please also improve ur network....Thanks O2 for all them years but im off...,1
"I've had a bit of a bad experience with o2 recently. I use my text messages a lot and some of them have taken quite a long time to arrive.O2 said that, once you send a text, it can take up to 72h to arrive. I was surprised at that as most of the time, the text messages get there right away. Sorry o2 but only 3stars.",1
"I can't say I had good service from O2 but over 2 years I never had a problem and didn't spend hours on hold. IFar better than Vodafone who made mistakes every time I renewed.I've also trailed Three, Lyca and Talk Mobile for 1 month each just to try before I by and each one was really really bad.",1
"I was with O2 a little over a month, the service was fine day to day, but I live near a football pitch and every time a match was on the network would fall over.I had to call customer service a couple of times as there was a delay in porting my number over, every time I called they were really friendly and helpful and sorted me out.In the end, I'm a heavy user and I like streaming music/videos etc. and the network wasn't strong enough to handle this, so I've left. But for anyone else it would be a great network.",1
"Some good and bad things. This was the first network I used, and I used them for years. The price was definitely on the high end (bad) on the other hand, the signal reach was very strong and I rarely ran into deadzones in London. Ended up switching networks due to costs.",1
I ordered home mobile broadband with the 30day rolling contract but the process was far from smooth. It took multiple phone calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package. I had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim card which would save me some money - but I had to repeat that I did not want this and wanted the mobile broadband only. The actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least.,1
"I have never had a moment's problem with my O2 phone!  Mine is a simple one as I only want it for making and receiving phone calls and texts.  Being an only child, and having lived on my own at certain times of my life, I appreciate having knowing that I can now be connected easily to everyone else.  At the same time, I don't get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call.  Then there are the frequent competitions, which are fun, the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome.",1
Manchester Arndale store service is utterly awful. Too many bodies for very little work. The staff have a can't be bothered attitude. Majority of the staff are looking at their own phones.Online service was excellent. Omar was very helpful and managed to find us a good deal.,1
"I've had quite a few dealings with o2 in the last 12 months.  There have been some good experiences and some absolutely disgraceful ones. I find that if you get through to the overseas agents then you are in trouble, they don't seem to have had much training at all and it shows. It's something when I know my rights more than they do. Its really bad but I just usually keep trying until I get the UK based call centre. I find the live chat is the best option but even then you can be there a while if your query is out of the ordinary.",1
"I have been an o2 customer for 6 years now. Every year it gets worse...I wanted to upgrade my phone recently and it would appear that new customers get the deal I wanted @ £25 a month whilst an upgrade customers (myself) must pay £31! How unfair is this!Also, ringing their Customer Service is a nightmare! You keep waiting for about 40 minutes before someone actually decides to pick up the phone!I have been quite happy with call charges, data charges etc, just a pitty that I do not feel valued as a long term customer.",1
Been with O2 for a quite a few years now (mobile phone & broadband). Have had really good experience with broadband support when needed but recently have found their prices increasing making them the most expensive of the popular providers rather than the value provider they used to be.,1
"Been with o2 from 2016 and that time the service it was great but now the internet is very slow, (3 star only for the past experience)PS my partner has a budget provider which has better signal and internet at a lower cost.",1
"They changed my contract, said I can leave without penalties. I left. Then I have received a bill for 300£, called them they apologized said they gonna fix it. Today 300£ left my bank account.Update:Refunded.",1
"Been with o2 for years always got good customer  service, however  today I really got the impression  the person I spoke to hated his job.",1
"I've been with o2 since I was a child, I'm now 25. I had never had any problems with o2 until I recently tried to upgrade my phone.Without going into too much detail, they basically fudged up the upgrade and made me return the handset and said I had to go through the whole upgrade process again. All because of their own misleading sales team.I was left without a phone for almost 2 weeks as things were delayed etc. Made a complaint and they did actually resolve it well and to my satisfaction.Will continue to use o2... for now anyway...! :)",1
I have been with o2 for 12 years and originally had brilliant broadband with them too until they sold it to sky. The main thing that kept me with o2 was the original fantastic customer service. Unfortunately this has dwindled over the years…and especially since Telefonica.I have recently had two enquiries. One rep was abrupt abs made me feel stupid for not knowing the answer to my question already and closed the conversation by hanging up. The second was more helpful.I also looked for sim only upgrade options but none came near the one available on U switch- the fact they would they not offer loyal customers their best deals says it all about how the company has gone really.,1
"Lets get one thing straight.... I loved O2, the staff were fantastic but I was forced to change internet suppliers once my first year contract ran out and they had no unlimited internet package even tho I had been on one for 12 months - The old new customers only nonsense.",1
I recently upgraded my phone online and was happy that I got a good deal for the handset I wanted but it didn't arrive on the day it was expected and I had to really push for compensation for the wasted day.I also had to explain the problem to 3 different people on their 'chat' facility because you can't always get the same person and the 202  phone number on their website didn't work!The support felt very faceless to me and I didn't really feel like they cared about my custom given that I've been with them for over 10 years!,1
"I have been with O2 for sometime and the service is average for the amount I pay each month. They are not interested in helping when there is a problem and slow to fix any problems, even when it is there fault. The signal is very weak in many areas.",1
I have recently purchased a prepay phone from O2 however I had a difficult time finding their track your order button. I wish they could have listed in on their footer for easier access rather than digging deeper to how many pages I have been redirected,1
I always had a good service with O2 for 7 years on contract. However when it came to renewal this year I left as they no longer had customer loyalty discounts. So I immediately switched network (t-mobile) and it's just as good yet reasonably priced!,1
I've been with O2 since they were BT Cellnet and have always been happy with the service until recently.   O2 now default to 36 month contracts which are the same (or dearer) than other major network's 24 month contract.  At my last renewal I took out an O2 24 month contract on a P30 Pro with triple data (45GB) on a third party provider for £20 per month cheaper than I could get it from O2 themselves.  How does that work?? I even got a free Sonos speaker!!My wife has switched to Vodafone unlimited max for less than she was paying for 12gb with O2Sadly from O2 having 5 contracts in our house they will find themselves with none,1
"I switched to O2 when my old contract with Vodafone wasn't renewed as they couldn't provide a decent signal at home.The cost of the data O2 charge is crazy compared to some but the refresh contracts are a great idea! Being able to pay my handset off in smaller amounts and knowing I can 'buy out' of my contract is a great way to stay in control. However, their 4G service does need work as it can be really, really slow which isn't great when considering their data charges.Otherwise, not had a problem with their customer service team who are normally pretty good at providing advice in my experiences anyway!",1
"I have generally been happy with O2 service, no major issues, they have replaced faulty handsets without issue, but they are let down by their email/web support, which is outsourced to india and as usual they do not read your emails properly or do not understand  and you end up having to repeat yourself several times only to be told they cannot help you and you need to call support.You really need to call them from the start to avoid this issue as their phone support is email based.They are however better in every way than Orange or Vodafone.--sadly things went downhill since I posted this, so I have since posted a new one.",1
"The network can let you down sometimes - recently I had bought the O2 mobile broadband service but it never worked as well as I would have expected it to. Also, it promised free access to BT Openzone but that would never work.",1
"I  really don’t like o2, but first, credit where credit’s due:Good coverage,Good insurance,Good web UI,Good fraud reporting system.- BUT- very overpriced compared to eg Giffgaff (which is also owned by the same Spanish Telefónica company who own o2, and MoviStar- but you don’t get that in the UK)- totally inflexible plans - costs £10 for 1 extra gig if you run out!- Poor customer service; they’ve got very long waiting times. If you call ‘threatening’ to quit, they won’t sweet talk you, just try and get rid of you.- leaving ASAP for some flexible & affordable data.- Phones are pricey through them too.Addendum: you have to wonder what data leak on their end causes all the scammers to have o2 numbers. Probably using some archaic unprotected database",1
Cheap for what you get. Coverage is patchy at best in the countryside. Not for you if you live in the UK countryside or plan on travelling inside the UK. Great value for London + abroad.,1
"My phone works reasonably well with little problems. I think the value is average with little appreciation of its loyal customers, When renewal of contract is due. Its like they dont care which is to often the case.",1
"I have been loyal to o2 since owning a mobile phone. I love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where I live (in the sticks) however, the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly frustrating. They couldn't understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn't helped the problem at all. Next time, I think I will send it to HTC directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when I explained it to them. Apart from that, o2 are still a good company, but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors.",1
"It took them ages to activate my SIM card... Very annoying. Now everything is ok, but I wouldn't buy a new SIM from them again. And the online customer service team wasn't very helpful...",1
Had no issues for 12 - 14 months... started to experience network issues in my place of residence...at 1st very helpful but then the online gurus started to become increasingly uninterested ... for want of better words... I have  3 x O2 contract mobiles in my home ... when sitting them side by side ... 2 x have 3 to 4 bar reception whilst mine has 1 or none and when answering a call the phone dies.... I hasten to add that no call problems previously.... Was told not their problem you receive a signal out with your property so they have fulfilled their part of the contract... not acceptable I'm afraid .... have been loyal customer for 20+ years with O2 and BT mobile before that... another custo er lost as soon as contract up in July...,1
I just got a sim only contract with o2 under the assumption that I would be able to use volt with virgin media to double my data (as advertised).Unfortunately they do not tell you that if you receive any other perk from virgin media this means that you cannot use this volt feature without disabling the other.This makes zero sense considering it’s a different company.They really should make this known.As it is they actually say not to try and activate this feature until 14 days which seemed very suspicious to me (hence why I rang the moment I got the contract).The 3 stars is for the actual service which is very stable and is actually faster to respond and load media than my three sim but lacks 5g anywhere in my city or surrounding areas so I can’t give it full stars.Unfortunately I will be cancelling within my 14 day window due to these issues.,1
"I have been with 02 now for 2 weeks and my phone still isn't working !Every time I try and log on it just says ""there seems to be a problem try again in a couple of minutes.",1
"I was concerned about the lengthy and somewhat overbearing security my husband and myself experienced at Jeff Lynne's ELO  gig on 20.10.18.  I of course, understand the need for heightened security in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack..  However, my husband was submitted to a fairly intimate body check and my small bag was given an extensive search rather than the  quick glance I am used to.  There seemed to be no apparent cause for this other than perhaps our outward appearance.  We are both  obviously aged over 55 and have disabilities). Our only reason for attending this gig was for a fun nostalgic evening, for which we paid a good deal of money.  Your ""customer safety"" people rather spoilt the tone of the evening to start with.",1
Previous customer. On the plus side great coverage in the areas i live and work. Down side missing the mark on pricing. Saving at least 30% by switching,1
"Went abroad and added the O2 travel bolt on to my account in order to use minutes, texts and data. Returned home from abroad to find they have charged me for roaming charges (Data) although I had the O2 travel bolt on. Spoke to customer service and explained why I shouldn't have these charges which they agreed and rightly removed the roaming charges. The dishonest part is them telling me I used my phone for Data roaming before I activated my O2 travel bolt on even though I didn't switch my mobile data on until i received email confirmation the bolt on was active. When I made the point to customer service, that it didn't make sense they didn't seem to have an answer. Obvious they were trying to make out it was my mistake when in actual fact it was a mistake on their part in order to avoid me asking them to compensate for their mistake. Will definitely be looking to move from the network once my contract expires if this is how they treat their loyal customers.",1
I got an iphone 6 delivered and on a decent rate contract. However mid contract o2 decided to increase the price and I have no get out so just have to pay this. Not happy with this.,1
Very ignorant. Eventually had my issue resolved,1
"Why is it long standing customers get the same deal as new customers,when they are due for a upgrade?This does not encourage loyalty when other companies offer better deals.",1
"So I have a two year contract with O2 and I specifically told them I wanted my service capped. Since then they have invented all sorts of reasons to charge more. They have the technology to adhere to this contract but shows no interest in it as they feel they must grow their income at customers expense. The long and short of it from a £27 monthly contract my bill has been raised to £41 on account of phoning a number which cost  no more on a land line than normal rate. Spoke to an agent and paid the $33 difference who decide to revoke the fee and resume my service only to find two days later the service cut off and a demand for the £8 pounds. Been a customer for nearly two years , contract due for renewal Jan, needless to say , I will not be renewing. Thats not the best way to treat people after paying up to date.",1
"I don't have many problems with O2. Yes their coverage is not as good as some networks and so is patchy at times, but they're generally okay",1
Experience has been alright. I have good reception but prices are crazy.,1
Everything seems to be challenging with o2 from upgrading phones for our business to getting support from their business team. Needs a real shake up!,1
"Came time to renew and phoned up to ask for the contract to be terminated. Fair enough, they asked why and went through some options.  Gave me what seemed a good deal to stay with the network and . . . the confirmation they sent through quickly did not mention cost, nor did ANY contact with them.  I didn't get a confirmation by email either about what I had signed up to.I was rather naive I admit taking their word for it.  Came time for the bills and they didn't give me what I asked for - in fact instead of it being £24 per month it was £37.  And of course, despite the 'your call could be recorded' routine, they couldn't find a record of the conversation anywhere.  Morale. Reasonable coverage and service - just CHECK and ask for confirmation in writing of anything they say. They can't be trusted in that way",1
"Just joined O2 from three as I have poor signal. I have already been sent a bill despite not even having my sim card yet whish is, I think, a bit rich",1
"i emailed the customer service team, they said it would take 2 days to come back to me but i was more like 5, when they did come back they resolved my issue though.",1
"This is an appeal to everyone who may have experienced the same problem!!!A recruitment agent managed to leave a message on my mobile without letting me take the telephone call. I was in the city centre where I had maximum signal. I was holding my O2 mobile phone in my hand because I was expecting a recruitment agent to give me a call.Suddenly my mobile phone vibrated once. I was getting ready to answer the call but the call never came. In a few second I received a message from O2 to say that I had a voice message. It puzzled me because my phone had no missed call, and the signal was at maximum, so there was no problem for me to take the call. I went to O2 boutique, a technician said that it may be a problem with my SIM card. When I asked whether O2 was selling a service that would allow agencies to leave messages at will, the guy refused to answer!!! Does anyone know anything like this?",1
"I had been with O2 for a number of years, and generally their service was above average.However, I moved house, and that was the beginning of a very sorry saga.  In a period of 15 months I had 6 routers.  Each one had a different problem, ranging from getting so hot, I did not need heating, random drop outs, disconnections, and the list goes on.Finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided, I contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act together.  In fairness the customer service were every helpful, waiving the early termination fees.  But, it is only since I have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has become increasingly apparent.  Since I have changed, I am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house.  Not just sat on top of the router.This review is now a little redundant as Sky is buying out O2s' customer base.",1
"Seem to treat different customers in a different manner. Called Sir when I'm a business customer, Alan if I have a problem with my personal phone.",1
The phone service is always helpful but every time I have spoken to live chat they end up getting it wrong. This time sent us the incorrect sim cards.,1
Must say the event was perfect but leading up it was awful trying to get through to customer services please please fix this!,1
good coverage not bad pricing only gripe is 24 month contracts but been with them since it was cellnet 17 years so they must be doing something right,1
"Used O2 on a pay monthly contract for 3 years. They would always offer very good discounts when my contract was up for renewal, and the customer service is helpful and easy to get a hold of. However this year they couldn't offer a good enough discount so I changed provider. When I phoned to get the PAC code, I was told by the operator I could terminate my contract anytime 30 days before the contract termination date, as there was a 30 day notice anyway. However now I have received my last bill and they have charged me for a contract termination fee equivalent to 2 months of contract. When I phoned the customer service they were apologetic that the operator I talked to didn't make me aware of this at the time but I personally feel I have been tricked into paying these fees.All in all, O2 is just as good as any other provider and offer competitive rates, but make sure you thoroughly ask them about fees before you terminate your contract with them!",1
Why is your VAT ridiculous now and why do you KEEP on raising my bill. I'm going to be paying £45 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone,1
My grip is the broadband I have with them the service could be better I've been with O2 a few years and you don't get anything for loyalty,1
Have moved from Vodafone after ten years (ouch!) as O2 offered a good deal and Vodafone couldnt match it. Have so far been pleasantly surprised.,1
"We have a couple of iPhones and Blackberries with O2. The service is usually problem free, but we find that 3G coverage is really hit and miss.",1
Very limited 4g coverage in central london and surrounding areas.  Vodafone was much better.O2 priority makes it just about worthwhile.,1
"The website was a nightmare to use for me after mix up with my details left me with 2 different online 'identities' attached to one phone number, causing problems every time I tried to log in.  This left me no option but to call the customer service line, who were unable to help me on the numerous occasions when I called to discuss the problem.  I am not so unreasonable as I don't understand that problems occur, however I found o2's response (or lack thereof) very disappointing, especially because I had previously been very happy with my o2 tariff.  However a good tariff isn't everything, the customer support needs to be good too. I have now moved my custom to Vodafone, who have been much easier to deal with (so far) - As an (almost comical) post-script to the entire business, o2 then erroneously deducted a further, dd payment after my last bill date; they have since apologised and refunded but it certainly didn't improve my opinion of them.",1
"At first I gave it 1 star, though it is what it is. Which is a simple app. Nothing great and nothing awful.",1
"PAYG mobile ... cannot log in and they cannot find my number even though I use it regularly, 3 weeks ago I needed a separate mobile broadband sim while changing broadband suppliers, set up account and log in a week later to check my usage not a problem, 3 weeks later tried to log in again and they cannot find my broadband number so I cannot access my account and they cannot find my e mail address yet they are sending me e mails quoting last 4 digits of my broadband number, absolute mess and pointless trying to phone as no one answering, should have stuck with EEOriginal review was 1 star however having failed get in touch with anyone on the phone I filled in a complaint form and the matter was sorted within 24 hours so fair is fair and I have upgraded the review to 3 stars as the matter was sorted, I haven’t made it 5 stars as the problem should never have happened in the first place and there was no explanation or apology for the problems caused. Perhaps they should also open up an e mail help line for non urgent matters and save people hanging on an unanswered phone line. Just a thought.",1
"I'm not sure there's much to choose between mobile phone businesses. For every bad experience, there's a good 'un, snuck away somewhere...or maybe people only moan these days. My phone deal was up and not gonna' lie, I hate when that happens. A morass of offers and sheer confusion, lies ahead. Got a phone deal from BuyMobiles (they were easy to deal with and the phone arrived next day). However, I needed to tidy up the old O2 deal and retain the number. Step up Kirsty Fairbrother! A voice on the phone, from sunny St Helens. Super efficient, super friendly and nothing a problem. Explained, sorted...bish, bash and most certainly, bosh. 5 stars for Kirsty. So why 3 stars overall? That's just for O2. Crap upgrade offer. Live chat only, as outside our 'normal hours', I'd be dealing with someone (nice as they are) in Manila, or some such and a website that seems to be unreachable, on more occasions than should be the case, for a tech business. Well, I have my phone, I have a great deal and I had a Kirsty on my side...everyone should have a Kirsty on their side...",1
"Signal is awful, monthly contract prices are criminal but they're the best of a bad bunch.",1
I often loose signals on O2. I previously used Vodafone and never experienced any problems. Its not that bad but not that good either.,1
"I was with O2 for almost five years, and I was very reluctant to leave. I wanted to upgrade my phone to the HTC Sensation at the end of my contract, but the offer online was much more expensive than offers I had found elsewhere so I gave them a ring.The lady who I spoke to was really unhelpful, and told me that they wouldn't be selling the sensation for long as it was an old model (which is rubbish), and offered me an even older model stating that this would match the price of the offers I had found!Eventually after speaking to about 4 different people, all of whom give me various rubbish answers and not one of them tried to keep me as a customer, I decided to leave. It then took me another 3 phone calls to get my MAC code....!Shame about the above because prior to that I'd always sung their praises! I'd also like to think that it was a one off, but my Mum left them about 3 weeks later and had exactly the same problems!!Get your act together o2 - repeat customers are the way forward!",1
Good service but I ordered an Adroid Ace and it said on the O2 website I could get BBC iPlayer which was actually incorrect.,1
"My review is neutral as there are some good and bad points.I find my O2 signal decent compared with other contracts with THREE and Vodafone. I usually get to chat to someone quite quickly (prior to this Covid19 emergency) and they can mainly solve my issue.I recently upgraded and noticed that a free amazon prime/Disney+ etc was available for free. I upgraded and didn't receive any correspondence. I contacted them to be told that the freebie wasn't available on the tariff I have purchased. As I have other contracts with other providers, I opted for the lowest tariff of unlimited calls and 1gb of data. The phones cost was broken down over the monthly duration then £19 is added for this 1gb tariff. I didn't think too much about it until a month later then have a big advertising campaign promoting SIM only with 50gb of data for £20.O2 claim you only pay the actual handset price but the tariffs are extortionate compared to a plan without a phone. To me, a plan should cost the same regardless of the phone element then the phone is added at the true cost O2 want to charge instead of hiding it behind inflated tarrifs.",1
Good customer service just never take out O2 insurance hard to find there number and impossible to make a claim,1
"Update: 17/08/23, they put my line back in service during the pandemic when I had no phone line. It wasn't kind. They offer a good service, which seems to have improved gradually. 03/01/2021 Poor service; they cut my line during the lockdown, and I had no phone left in case of a life emergency",1
Helpful advice from O2 shop in seeking mobile phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history.,1
"O2 refresh good, allowed to upgraded 13 months early for free however very poor speeds in my area",1
The contracts are decent and signal is good. The customer service is not reachable though!,1
The signal in my area isn't brilliant although my bill isn't too bad.,1
"Far too quick to get you as a customer, very little service afterwards...",1
Can't wait for my mobile contract to end so I can change supplier,1
not getting the coverage i would like in some areas of hampshire,1
"Why can't it be set up that I get informed/warned if I am about to use a service that I will incur extra charges on my bill?I have just come back from Orlando and have been charged every day I was there. I knew I would be charged for some of the days as we were away from the hotel but I used the internet at the hotel on the days we were there. I had the UBER app so we could arrange for taxis wherever we were, but these have worked out more expensive than the I-RIDE now because of my charges from O2. If I had been paying for my 12 year old daughters phone I would have incurred the charges for this too and that wouldn't have been her fault.My children know when in the UK that if they say there will be a charge for something (I.E.Game or tune download) then they are not to continue. Surely if they can warn you of this then they can warn you if you are subject to be charched if you continue with a certain service abroad. Luckily my 18 year old son has juat put his phone in his own name as I had paid for it for the last 3 years.If any of my children were on my contract and had incurred these charges without being warned I would have refused to pay them and taken it to court. This needs to be addressed so that we can make the choice to continue with or avoid the charges...??I have been with O2 for approx 6 years or more and have always found them good but this recent experience will have me checking out their competitors on my next renewal unless they change it.Originally would have got 4 stars possibly even 5 until this recent rip off scam.!!",1
"Coverages OK, but customer service center could be better.",1
Good network but poor signal in the Birmingham area,1
"This has to be the most frustrating, confusing, overcomplicated and inefficient website I have ever experienced. Every month it's a fight to actually view the bill. When you 'sign in' it constantly kicks you to generic pages about what they do or what you can buy or changing your details, it's a labyrinthine pot luck to view what 'your o2' is actually doing. Eg, viewing a bill or attempting to top up or even attempting to buy anything you've seen on the page before?..... I'm just going to say GOOD LUCK!! The very few times I have ever managed it is by clicking the link on the billing email the very first time I've opened it and that has still usually taken several attempts. Trying to contact them is pointless, I have done so via their 'contact us' link on several occasions and had generic 'click view my bill' etc instructions (like that's not what I'd done in the first place!???) for the first couple of times then absolutely NOTHING! And, before you wonder, I have never been rude or abusive I've just said I've tried that but it's not working can you help further? The people in the shop are lovely but they seem to struggle getting the site to do anything as well! Ironically, the poor site must confuse itself because if I see another 'sorry, we are dead busy, please try later' message I will scream. Luckily I'm ultimately not that fussed as long as I can text, call and receive calls. If I was a serious mobile phone user I would be straight onto switch sites! God knows who they employed to design their website but I would ask for my money back if it was me!!! Blimey!!!!!!......6th April 2023: they have obviously had a massive overhaul. My experience of direct customer service in 2019 was excellent and their access to bills etc is now not a problem so credit where credit is due! Hence 3 stars now instead of one",1
"New phone from O2 using old mobile number.There are are 3 phases to my last experience with O21) The sales transaction went through very smoothly and I received the phone on time as stated. One minor issue with not sending me the new format Micro Sim card, but sent me a free Pay-As-You-Go sim card.2) Upon receipt, called O2 and reported the missing sim card, and that I need my old number managed by O2 to work with the new phone etc. At the time I was still using my 4 year old mobile phone. The assistant took my details, phone details, details of the Pay-as you go sim card and even details of my old phone's sim card.The O2 assistant then went ahead and logged the details and made some changes. Note that my old number is purely used for business support and the account with O2 is also a business account.The following day by sheer coincidence one of the walked in customer informed me that my phone number seems to be cut off!!!!  Only then I realised what the O2's operator had done to my 23 year old business phone number. She changed my old number with the Pay-as-you-go number so my old phone now only works with the PAYG number!!!3) Furiously called O2, a very calm operator took the details investigated what was done and apologetically managed to undo what was done, it did take about an hour before I get my old phone number back and also he arranged for a new sim card to be sent, so the new phone with the new sim card and the old number eventually worked together.In terms of marking:1) Phase-1:       4*       would have been 5 if I had received the Sim card.2) Phase-2:       0*       I am being too generous here3) Phase-3        5*       For fixing the problem so promptly.",1
"Have bought new phone from 02 for my 02 service only contract. What a farce. Had to buy it via taking out other contract and then paying it off. Lad in shop was very precise about what I needed to do and even gave me script. I followed it to the letter luckily and noted down time, name of operative and transaction number. A month later they charged me £600 for not using the contract. I phoned twice to try and get them to repay the amount and eventually had to get my bank to take the money back. Then they took it out again the next month because nobody it seems had made a note of the repayment. I've just had a third call. No manager in the office to speak to. They acknowledge I don't owe them the money but just don't seem to be able to get it together to stop taking it. Have been with them years because their coverage is good but this side of the business is totally chaotic, very badly organised and frankly leaves you feeling they couldn't give a damn.Update: On my bill for December it appears this problem is finally sorted. It took four telephone calls, an email and a visit back to the O2 shop where I bought the phone. One of the problems seems to be their billing service is automated and carries on sending out bills even when they adjust the amount in the account. A second problem is the telephone operatives are not authorised to adjust bills above a certain amount so they have to contact another department to authorise that and a third problem is that the supervisors are not numerous enough to deal with the volume of complaints so are not available to deal with you at the point of contact. To be fair, the humans I came in contact with were uniformly courteous. It appears to be the systems which require a radical rethink.",1
The best service provider but the prices very high.,1
"New contract with slow 4G and 3G speeds.I took out a new contract with the OnePlus 5T handset and had come from the EE network. The O2 network was very slow for 4G and 3G speeds. After I had contacted their customer services, they were unable to tell me why I was receiving slow speeds (2-10mbps) on 4G. I couldn't even load the Google Homepage, I might as well have had an old Nokia as the only thing my handset could do was make and receive phone calls.They allowed me to do one of the following;Send the handset back to them and pay for one months' airtime, ending my contractorPay the handset value off, which then can be unlocked for free and used on another network.I opted for the latter, paid £438, and they unlocked my handset and ended my contract without penalty. I have switched back to EE, and back to the normal 50-60mbps 4G speeds.Their customer service team, particularly the technical support team aren't very good they told me that their phone masts were working correctly and that the network might be ""busy"" and when I complained regarding the slow speeds they made no effort to retain me as a customer and the retentions team processed my cancelation within minutes. Maybe they are aware of the slow speeds?To me, 4G speeds should be at a minimum of 30mbps, and just like home broadband packages now they should be regulated with a minimum guaranteed speed at your home address. I was lucky in this instance that O2 allow you to pay off your device and leave, but if it was over the 14 day cooling off period and I was with another provider then I would have been stuck in a 24 month contract with slow speeds. Hats off to O2 for resolving my issue and allowing me to leave my contract, I would return as a customer if they sort out the speed of their 4G services.",1
"I don't know where to start. We've seen the worst possible customer service with over 8 hours on the phone to O2 in more than 30 calls. Please read this is you ever have problems reactivating your phone after reporting lost temporarily to O2.  They couldn't reverse the blocks they put on our phones.  It ended well in the end with 2 new phones provided free of charge - which is why the 3 star rating.- Loss of phone for a few hours result in device blacklisted.- Phone found shortly after. After 8 days and 8 hours of calls O2 still couldn't reverse what they had done to the phone even after removing the blacklist. As a result no signal, calls, imessage etc... the phone could only be used on WIFI.- To make worse O2 asked the sim to be put in someone else's phone to see if it worked. Doing this blacklisted their phone too and again when O2 reversed the process their Iphone was left unusable except via WIFI. Their phone was not on O2.- After much wrangling and refusals, O2 replaced the O2 contract handset with a new one via next day delivery but denied any responsibility for the £1,100 + non O2 Iphone 12 Pro they had made unusable. Attempts were made to blame Apple and the carrier the phone was actually on.- We logged all calls (time, date, content etc..) ready to go to small claims court or ombudsman. The formal complaint process was initiated via email. An email was sent to the CEO (and a response from his team received within 24 hours), social media used and info sent a newspaper consumer champion.- Finally on the evening of 31st Jan we received a call from someone senior, professional and clued-up who wanted to help. After sending screen shots directly whilst on the call via email to them, a new un-locked Iphone 12 Pro at zero cost was promised via next day delivery.  The old phone will be returned in due course as part of the process.This non-O2 new replacement phone has just arrived as promised and with my old sim card I finally have a signal and working phone back. Thank you to who eventually sorted it out.",1
"I decided to move from SIM-ONLY to o2 Refresh, because o2 was doing a buy 30GB for the price of 10GB deal.Speaking to the agent was great. She was very helpful, polite and sorted out my package quickly.Rather than have it sent via post, I decided to collect from my local store in WEMBLEY CENTRAL.After carefully reading the instructions on the email, I went to the shop with Order number and the Debit card used to make the transaction.Once I got there, I showed my Order number, then was asked for my Debit card. I was asked a few security questions, then I was asked to supply photo ID.At this point I informed them that the email from o2 said NOTHING about photo ID. I brought what I was asked to bring in the EMAIL. The AGENT who sold me the phone also told me to bring these things and nothing else.I was then told there was nothing they could do and I would have to go get photo ID.I had a friendly back and forth with them, informing them that their shop and o2 need to get on the same page. o2 is telling me one thing...... You guys are telling me something else.I also informed the GUY that I was dealing with there, that I also have experience dealing in Customer Service, and this isnt the correct way to handle this situation.HIS response was, ""Well if you have experience in Customer Service, YOU should know better""......... LOL ........At this moment, I fully understood why O2 has such Low ratings.I went home, got my ID and brought up my email on the phone. Showed it to the staff and asked them to read it out to me. They quickly realised they were wrong and apologised....... BUT... damage was already done.They explained that their store is a Franchise etc etc etc, thats why they are more strict with security...... not sure why a customer needs to know thisIn the end, I dont fault them to much. O2 need to train their staff.But they also need to recognise that these kids represent their company and brand",1
PASYG cheap but coverage only fair,1
"A mixed customer experience made at last satisfactory.A few years back, I took out a dongle mobile broadband account with O2 which I used infrequently to use during outside broadcasts for a Gospel Radio Station.Last November 2017, I asked O2 to discontinue this as I was personally paying for as a gift to the charity and use had dwindled down to 0 use.I was assured by helpful phone staff that this would go through in the next few days and to ignore any bills.  The account was to have been put on a PAYG basis.  A bill came in December then January.  I followed this up.  The helpful staff assured me there had been an issue and applied credit to cover the bill. Good...Then a bill for £.00 came in February.  My THought - What are O2 doing wasting money of course the account is cleared and PAYG.A bill of disconnection came in March for £19.08.  What?  How can you have £0.00 one month then £19.08 the next?  What are O2 playing at? A call to the friendly apologetic Samantha reulted in no answers as she could not get into the system with the info I had given.  She suggested I try an 02 store with the device.I did so today but the staff there were unable to directly help short of giving me a phone to call. The helpful Jen offered to sit with me while I called and she did until I was able to speak to someone.   38min and 6 seconds later - I think a result.Most of the time was spent waiting while David and his colleague did their best to clarify the situation then arrange to apply a credit to cover the full cost of charges up to 10 March.It is a mark of a very good company to admit when they are wrong.  This David and his colleagues have done and have tried to make good.  Hats off to the individuals in O2 who try to make good. They should be appauded.It is a mark of a very poor company when the accounting system lets its employees down and does not apply the changes customers ask for and are promised and sends wasteful, spurious bills.  If I am annoyed and inconvenienced think of the effect on those less able to pay their bills and those vulnerable.If O2 truly have made good and short of the final statement, I do not receive another bill, all well and good.  If not, watch this space.  I won't hold my breath.",1
Solid but evil on pricing,1
Ripped me off,1
never used,1
Been with O2 for 7-8 years and I can say they have fallen from grace there signal quality is very poor cant get reception in my own home now when once they where the only company that could and the prices of contracts compared to what you get is terrible my girlfriend changed hers when she got an iPhone and they told her she want this contract then cos her old one was to much she then run up a £60 just a scam to get her of her old decent contract.,1
"I walked out of my local O2 shop when they said quote ""yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like (4S)""....so I went to Vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones..so went back to 02. No joy, no price match not even for a long term customer with 4 phones in the family...so went back to Vodaphone. They suggested I called O2 retention !!!!!! I did - they did a great deal...BUT. When the new 4S stops working the customer service refer you to an O2 shop - who will have nothing to do with you. As neither will Apple. Buying from 'retention' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with O2 retail shops.  Poor service, wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone. Only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 3 hrs and 5 calls waiting on piped music landlines.",1
"Edit: Dropped to three stars as I dropped O2 when their signal in my town went through the floor after some 'consolidation' of masts.O2 aren't perfect, no telecoms provider is, but after dealing with all of the 'big 4' top tier mobile telecoms companies at one time or another O2 comes out on top by a long chalk in terms of the coverage they provide (both 2G and 3G), the value of their products and contracts, and the customer service they provide when needed.They could certainly improve in all three areas, and particularly in customer service, but I would rate them as 'acceptable' or higher in all three areas, something I couldn't say for Vodafone, Orange / T-Mobile, or 3 and certainly wouldn't say for ANY of the 'virtual' providers such as Virgin / Tesco etc.",1
"have been an o2 customer for the last 4 years before that I was T-Mobile, changed whe I was assured that the reception would be much better than with T-Mobile, when?",1

"Good, but i'm jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment",1
Caravanning round the UK I was looking for a network that supported iPhone & gave good service. O2 has done this though I am surprised with the various 'blackspots' in coverage in Scotland & middle England compared to my wife who's phone is Orange. Quality/depth of service is certainly better than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than I,1
"always good service from customer service department, website really hard to use when trying to add/remove contact details on family bolt on - so would say website needs looking at by IT department. only let down is when someone at customer services say they'll call you back then don't",1
"I have been an O2 client since the first iPhone was released in the UK. The staff have always been particularly helpful (both in stores and on the phone) but a few things are lacking and haven't been improved during the time I have been a client with them:1. Mobile coverage is very poor in the outskirts of city centres, especially in the North.2. Very little offers for long-term customers, nothing exciting from keeping me on changing provider (in fact I will do so by the end of July).3. Some shops do not display real handsets! Is this a joke? How do I know if I like a particular phone when the only thing you see is a cheap plastic replica? **unfortunately this is a problem with other providers as well.",1
"Currently have personal 02 phone, which drops the 3g signal and makes it difficult to surf on the move. Work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week",1
I've never had a problem with the customer service side of o2 but find the reception to be very hit or miss.  Seems to be worse now I have an iphone.,1
all the companies need to start valuing their customers and not overcharging wherever they can,1
"Due to some market strategy, O2 have decided to push the new HTC HD7. At my last upgrade I had wanted an HTC Desire HD but, as usual, in their wisdom they decided not to stock it. Unfortunately I'm at the mercy of poor signal coverage so I'm stuck with them. Hopefully the other providers will have my area coverage sorted by the time my next upgrade is due because I'm definitely jumping ship. I've already got a rather expensive plan but for some reason I have never actually paid that amount on my bill. It is, without exception, always more expensive even though my phone usage is quite low!",1
many hidden charges and always charges over my monthly bill,1
see above as this summarises everything,1
keeps it simple,1
"Good signal coverage, calls rarely dropout. Tariffs are competitive too.Like many services, all is well until you need to actually speak to someone. The ""hold"" time for customer services is generally 5-10 mins and the individual at the other end of the phone can be hit or miss.I queued for 1hr 22mins last month to get through to the complaints dept only to be greeted immediately with ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"" - not ""Hello"", not ""Sorry to the delay"".When i asked if there was no way i could have been informed (i.e. recorded message or similar) without having to hold for almost an hour and a half she merely repeated ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"". Possibly the rudest anyone has ever been to me over the phone.I am still with o2 - only because I cant be bothered to ring back to cancel my contract.",1
I was a O2 customer for years but have just changed to Vodaphone. O2 do have excellent customer service and a easy to use website but the iphone coverage is very poor.I was also disappointed with the deals on offer compared to rivals.,1
I do not know what it is that you are gold or silver customer but they think they can con and trick on that talk. Want to upgrade now and they will have to do it if they have some system issues.Apart from that I am satisfied customer.,1
"your CS is good, insurance is diabolical,",1
Most Networks are saturate in the London area-but O2 still works very strong.But 3G on O2 is extremly slow while moving in a train or driving,1
"I was with o2 for some years, but the network seems to have become really unreliable for me. The 3G coverage is patchy and inconsistent, and dropped calls became the norm. A pity because if they could just sort the infrastructure I would still be with them today. I get the feeling they didn't invest in the backbone of the network quite as much as they ought. Customer services are excellent though and couldn't be more helpful. Maybe I'll return in the future when the network issues have been addressed.",1
Also a reasonable help line,1
"biggest problem loyal customers who want to stay, but get priced out you only get a deal when you cancel or are a new customer??",1
I find that o2 has the best mobile signal around the country. their customer service and tarriffs are not the best though,1
"...a bit sketchy in Woodingdean, Brighton though.",1
A good network however the coverage isnt always great. But all the tariffs are good on pay and go simplicity and unlimited,1
An average service. Had a major complaint when they made a mistake with a contract renewal date but it was handled well and the compensation given was fair.Customer service is average.,1
had to wait ages for a refund,1
"Good choice of business phones, though tends to be pricey.  Initial marketing suggested that I would be contacted if service was an over-provision: no such contact occurred.  When my phone needed repair, it was astonishingly expensive, and my queries about why were ignored.I won't be going back to O2 at the end of my contract.",1
"MY ORDER WAS PLACED ON THE 15TH OF DEC AND I PAID 5,88 FOR POSTAGE AND NOT RECIVED MY PRODUCT JUST HOPE ITS HERE FOR XMAS",1
"o2 fine, i'm not happy that i cant sign up for 12 months,it seem's to be the same with most server's these day's which i thing is wrong,we should have more choice with these contracts,R C",1
Generally good coverage which is what really matters to me.  However this seems to have deteriorated since I first started on this network a few years back,1
I generally get good coverage from 02 and have no complaints although the calls when overseas still seem excessive.,1
Unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers...,1
"the only problem ive had with o2 , isnt really an issue with service , my problem was the choice of so called upgrade after i renewed my contract , i gave up my N958gb which was a fantastic phone , and upgraded? to the nokia 5800 xpressmusic which isnt a great phone but was the only remotely decent phone that i could get for free, i did take 18month contract at £30 a month and im really disapointed because i could have got a much better phone for that level of tarrif from any of the other network providors ,so as much as i like the service provided , i will be lookin at the other providers first then maybe try nokia",1
"Everytime I upgrade I seems to get a lower value deal, it would be nice if o2 concidered the value of loyalty as much as it does new new business.",1
Ok overall but the tarrif for iphones seem a bit high.,1
"They always manage to replace damaged phones quickly. Would get 5 stars if they could change my tariff without screwing up every time.Update - dropped my rating by 1 star to 3 stars. They've always allowed me to upgrade cheaply 1 year into a 2 year contract provided I agreed to another 2 years. Option gone now - £100+ per phone. Guess I'll sit out the next 12 months, then look at my options elsewhere.Edit - June 2012Another 2 stars dropped - their 3G service is just too poor. I've bought a PAYG dongle from Three - 5 bars at home of 3G, even worked while on holiday in Orkney. My contract is up later this year, so I'll be switching to Three.Update October 2013 - OK, I'll put them back up to 3 stars! We're on O2 Business,  and the customer service is excellent. Just wish the network coverage was as good!After upgrading our email server, we've had problems with the Blackberry server. No problem for them to change the tariff. New phone (Nokia 520)  for just £59+VAT.Assuming they finally get TUGO working on Business tariffs, we might even stay with them when the contract expires!",1
I can't complain about the coverage but the customer service at o2 especially for business customers is appalling,1
Improvements could  be made when responding to complaints via email -,1
I only use the phone for work. if i use the phone more than once a week i'am on a good thing.I can't see why you have to top up by £10.00 all the time. Nothing worse than lossing a phone with lots of money on it.,1
Like coverage,1
hard to get VAT    invoices,1
"Love my Iphone.  But dont love that although I aready pay for a data pack, they are charging me for an Iphone data pack as well!",1
"fairly good reception, I don't know how to log on to check bill they don't make it very clear.",1
"I have never experienced any problems as a  low user wih O2.Perhaps I am lucky,but I always get a good signal with good sound quality.",1
"Good reliable phone service, however the longer you've been with them the less perks you get until there's no difference between them and others...",1
"I have been with o2 for a number of years, around about 10 I would say. I am on a very low monthly tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone. They offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets. When, and usually before the contract expires, a free upgrade is offered. Both the o2 store and o2 online have very good deals with extremely competitive prices.Their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price, with the cheapest line installation around. However, one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing customers, they no longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no longer benefiting their existing customers, who may now decide to leave.",1
"i have used o2 all my life and only recently experienced problems, i plan on changing to vodafone soon",1
"Overpriced but good customer service, if you need it.",1
"I thought the way that o2 handled the whole upgrade for this latest iPhone was pathetic. They kept me waiting for over 3 1/2 hrs in the rain with no updates about stock etc. It then turned out there was none left and no one in any of the shops in Glasgow, in particular theo r I q at the fort were the worst. They treated the customers like a piece of sh&t, treating them with utter contempt. The amount of custom o2 lost out to that day should be noted, around 40 plus people walked away disgusted. It's the first and the last time l ever q for a phone. Current iphone customers who have fed o2's profits for 18mths at over £50 a month should have had the priority of first refusal on the new phone, that would have been the decent thing to do. Everyone who was an o2 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon, now that they want an iphone. It was just a cheap marketing ploy to feed o2's pathetic ego, keeping ppl hanging about with false hopes.",1
"Overall the o2 experience is good, billing and customer helpwise I have no complaints, the 3G network needs improvement and further enhancement.In addition I think the 3G Network growth has come to a standstill as o2 applied for planning permission to upgrade their transmitter not 100 yards from my house over 12 months ago and they were granted permission but still have to do the upgrade, let just hope they do it within the life of the planning permission.",1
Good Service. But not satisfied with the billing system. Sometimes comes more sometimes less??????,1
"I was and am extremely happy at the extra care o2 put into customer services. However its disappointing that the good customer service is funded by my roaming charges. 4 days in Majorca, £230 phone bill? I even switched data off when i wasn't checking my 2kb emails. Not sure where I went wrong. What upset me more was the fact that the network i was using was 'Movistar'.. a Telefonica company (o2's owners). Disappointing o2!",1
"Dropped calls, rubbish 3G coverage.",1
The handsets avaliable to those that have had contracts with O2 are not that good you have better deals if you leave your contract and then get a new one.... No incentitive to stay with o2,1
"I have been with O2 since they were Cellnet. I recently wanted to downgrade my tarrif as I was paying far too much for for the minutes and texts that I actually use. They stated that I could not reduce my taffif until my contract was up. They did however say that I could increse my tarrif... They are quite happy to get more money, but won't give any back. I think it's time for a fresh network come December!",1
brilliant service. The staff always happy to help. The customer contact center is better than the instore service ant day. The service in the Blackpool store is not as good as Preston - St georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped.,1
"Overall, I don't have a problem with T-Mobile. I've been with them since their beginnings. What I have a problem with is to be insulted and lectured to by the AI. I needed to change a setting on the phone, (Which I finally figured out on my own. Not going to write what the technical support said to correct it). Thank God my Do Not Disturb turned on as she was trying to tell me some convoluted thing to do. My problem was I had changed the settings from Google to Samsung for the keyboardand voice texting. But could't change it back. Hence both were fighting for dominance. And I was stuck with repeat text messages. At least this phone wasn't sending them out like the s23 was. This time calling T-Mobile was a complete waste of my time. However, in all the years I have had them.I really can't complain. But get rid of The person who programmed the AI!!!",1
I’ve used T-Mobile military Business for twenty-five years. A few problems. One was never fixed. Our son went overseas. Now when people call my number a message says “Put these numbers into your phone to complete the call” I gave up on the fix WHAT HAS MADE ME ANGERY IS GIANT DOWN PAYMENTS. I have perfect credit. I’m disappointed in T-Mobile.,1
"Once we got our month T Mobile SIM installed it worked well, no problem there.  However, the SIM was sold as a month of use in the USA, when in fact service was terminated before midday on the 30th day, so effectively we only got 29 days use.  This was even more annoying as it meant we had no means of communicating on our day of departure.  Since when was a month only 29 days???",1
I wish I could give T-mobile a better score because they were great until I had to deal with their affiliate company Assurant for a broken phone. Assurant totally fell through in replacing my phone. So I went through 3 calls to T-mobile to get help. They did a lot of lip service how I was a valued customer but did NOT help me in any way other than offering a full price phone replacement.,1
If you are not connected to wifi it is terrible. Unlimited internet lol if it even loads.,1
"I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile around 8 years ago because Verizon customer service was horrid.I've never had a problem with them until recently, they refused our jump status which we pay for because we didn't want to pay more for the new plan. So therefore what I'm paying for is bull!!!!Then I got the Internet tower and they stated that price would not go up from $40 month.  I recently saw my bill and Internet was $45 a month.🤬",1
"We started with T-Mobile in 2018. Back then the service was amazing. Customer service was prompt and the CEO back then seemed right on top of things. However, after the CEO moved on, it seems like things have kind of fallen a bit… Customer service became hit or miss, home internet was offered to me, but then rescinded without me even being contacted, and the local stores in my area became not as competent as before. We recently moved service to Verizon.",1
"Experience the unbeatable power of T-Mobile! With a wide range of services, T-Mobile will help you stay connected, no matter where you are. From reliable 4G LTE data to unlimited talk and text, T-Mobile is the perfect choice for all your wireless needs. So don't wait - take advantage of T-Mobile, today!",1
"This is difficult, because I had a wonderful experience with the Bellingham WA call center. But I started in the Shoreline Midvale and Aurora physical store and have never been treated more rudely. So I would review the call center in WA 5+ and the physical store 0.  I am not sure why the sales rep was so rude but she needs to find a new job is she is that unhappy. Also she flat out lied when she said that I had to call customer service to resolve my problem. As the call center apologized and said they could have easily resolved your issue in the store.",1
"i've been using T-Mobile for past few month, it is the best network so far for me, am satisfied with the fast internet services lately. They have shown great empathy towards customer problems, strongly recommend it.",1
"I went into the T Mobile store in Fayetteville, Ga. today to get assistance with transferring information in my Samsung phone. I am 71 years old and not as savvy as the young people with computers but I do fairly well with my phone. the tech on duty did not listen to me when I told her my problem and I was told that older people "" need to start learning how to do this stuff themselves"" in a rude tone of voice. I told her sorry that I didn't want to bother her any longer. I drove to Riverdale ,Ga to the T Mobile store  where I was helped and treated with professionalism and courtesy. The later experience made up somewhat for the first experience but will not be returning to the Fayetteville location again",1
"Up until the past couple months we were always extremely pleased with T-Mobile, especially the Internet service.  Over the past couple months since we moved to SW Florida we have had several notifications about tower maintenance to ""ensure a great network experience"".  I beg to differ.  Last week there was a tower maintenance issue that completely disrupted and slowed our Internet service from 450 down to 12.  While their Internet customer service reps were very friendly, they tried to tell us it was our 5G device while all the while it was due to their tower issues.  We just got another notice about tower maintenance today.  All that seems to do is interrupt and slow down our service for days until it stabilizes. This is not acceptable when one works from home.",1
"I'm upset.  I'm a veteran of 8 + years. The veterans administration had me free phone service through t-mobile for a long time. The funding for the free phones stopped, t-mobile let me keep my number, but now I have to pay 60 a month! No problem with that,  but now I have to go prove I'm a veteran. Just goes to show, that T-MOBILE never really cared enough about veterans in the beginning! They don't even know we been in their system!",1
First I'd like to say their customer service is good.  We dealt with Drew in the Walnut Street store in Philadelphia.  He was great.  As far as the switching over from another carrier...READ THE FINE PRINT.  They say if you switch you get a free IPhone 14.  Not true if you want a Pro or better.  ASK QUESTIONS!!!,1
"I have had T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for 11 months. It was traumatic to install and took many hours. The Gateway is a small corded box controlled by a mobile based app, just plug the box in and turn on. My T-Mobile tower is 1/2 mile from my house, my Gateway sits next to a window about 10-30 feet from my devices, a MacAir book, 3 ipads, 2 iphones, an Epson printer USB connected to the Air book, and an LG smart tv. The advertised download speed is true, between 100-400 bps.The app, once the complicated passwords are renamed, is easy to use.My connection shows 'Excellent' about 95% of the time. I assume that means the connection between the box and the tower. The connection between the devices and the gateway are sporadic. Two of the ipads, uncorded, disconnect at least five times during the day, the worst is the lost connection to the 'Air Printer' several times a week. What is strange the one ipad and the tv are 100% corded and never lose connection. I suspect sharing the tower with the T-Mobile cellphone users may be part of the problem. My few calls to customer service were helpful and quick. I have paperless auto pay and is no problem. I have not disconnected the gateway and moved it to another location in the town, so can't say how that would work out. I recommend the service, which has limited locations, for the convenience, price, and listed speed, Maybe you would not experience the disconnect problems I have, a nuisance, but easily fixed by 'forgetting the network' and reconnecting with the password, There is no contract so a tryout will be easy to give up if not satisfied.",1
"I was with sprint and I didn’t have a choice of changing to T-Mobile when I was with Sprint they had a contract and I wanted to pay off my phone but by the time in the end of the contract they told me I couldn’t so I had at least my phone so many years I paid on the phone and they would not let me buy it now with T-Mobile They say they don’t have a so-called contract but if I pay off my phone early which I should be able to you still have to pay till the end of your billing so I can pay off my phone but I still have to pay for 18 more months that’s ridiculous. I would never go with T-mobile again ever if you’re smart by your phone outright, and do not get a contract. Do not sign anything with T-Mobile or Sprint  these totally take advantage of a person that doesn’t know they’re being taken advantage of !",1
"It's been great until lately.  I have an issue with the trade-in value that I got for a phone that I had that worked perfectly fine.  I just wanted to upgrade.The tech sent me back an email informing me that I would only get a 10% discount because of a display issue.  That meant that there was something wrong with the display on the phone.  There was nothing wrong with the display when I sent it.  I wanted to SEE what the problem was. When I called the agent, I was told that they didn't have that information.  That agent said that he understood my situation and could give me a 20% discount because I was such a good customer and had been and was a long-time customer.  The next billing period the discount that the agent promised was there.  Then the month after, it was gone, so I again called and that agent again understood the issue and he promised the 20%discount.  Again the next billing period the discount was there but only for a month.    The following month the discount was gone completely.  I called this time and the agent was completely rude but he did talk to the supervisor and said that they could put on the original discount but then said smugly, you should feel blessed that they put on the discount because usually when the tech said something is wrong, they don't give any discounts.  I said, Wow,REALLY?!  He also said that the 2 prior agents do not have permission in giving the 20% discount. So that was 2 separate agents that applied the discounts but shouldn't have?   I just wanted them to show me proof of the display issue.  That maybe the Tech made a mistake.    So I am really thinking about changing  Carriers because this was a total headache.",1
"As far as the cell service and internet service, they are good.  It's the supports they have in place that fail at both the stores and tech support.  When I added lines, the tech at the store told me one thing and it ended up being the opposite causing me money, stress, anxiety and frustration.  Eventually it was corrected, but geez.  He also never told me about the requirement to register my liquid screen for my phone for the warranty coverage.  He is no longer at that store.  I decided to get T-Mobile Inet, tried to order the service online, and had issues, so I went to the store and the tech told me that he could do it for me.  He cancelled my order and setup up my equipment.  However, he did not tell me by doing this my $200 rebate went to $100, which I just found out while returning to the store.  He instructed me to call tech support for any additional items needed for the Inet.  Well, the mesh needed it. I was also told that the 2.4g and 5g could be separated and certain devices will not work on the 5g.  I was on the phone with tech support and after 2+ hours, they could not figure out how to do that.  Then I went in for a warranty and was texted and emailed the product was there and they could not find it.  The tech handed it to me and said set it up like before.  I told him I did not set it up the store did.  There were issues with his capability to do that.  Then when I asked both of them about the internet and the 2.4g vs 5 it was deer with the headlights look and neither of them could help, nor did they offer to.  So back to the drawing board and figuring it out.  They are car salesmen and will tell you what they need to for the order and that is very disappointing.  At least with Spectrum they come to you and set things up.  Overpriced Inet, but they help.  I am frustrated as I can link all of my home devices to this Inet because of this issue which in turn impacts my home security.  The product the provide is worthless if the customers can't use it and/or don't understand how.  Then lets not forget the issue with the phone service (land line) if you want it.  That is a 3rd party and not explained until after you get the product.  Again, it's the techs who are not properly trained to understand and help the customer understand.  BTW, the store was dead and still no offer to help.  The playlist provided by corporate was vulgar.  I'm done now.  Get it together T-Mobile.",1
I just signed up with them a wk ago they will rush you into signing up that they for get to fully explain how much data the home internet has mines is about to run out soon but no one took out the time to explain how much was available it’s working good to be in a rural area but watch all the nice talking they’ll overlook some things in the process,1
"Mr. Carmelo thank you for your time and excellent service to help us, to solve our problem. Your Legend to help our frustration regarding the charges that we even doesn't know. We are so glad and very thankful that you can able to end up this ghost in our account. I can give 5 stars to this people that help us from the beggining until now Carmelo, John, Trey. They are smart people that we can assured help from customer service representative.",1
"Their people on chat had a number next to their names.  For that, I will give them 3 stars.  More companies should do this.",1
Being a 5g subscriber  I have been only on LTE service for 5 straight days in my area in Northern Virginia. Normally the service s satisfactory. The issue I have that  Prompts me to only give 3 stars to T-Mobile is the fact that I had to call customer service to find that they are making an upgrade to the 5G tower in my area. They never reached out to me to explain that I would be out of 5G coverage and apparently there is no time frame that I can be given on when my 5G service will be restored .  So now I am supposed to just continue paying for service that I don't know when I will be receiving? This is poor customer relations because they could have easily sent a text message to customers in this area that will be affected explaining that we will not have 5G service for a specified amount of time.,1
"Short and sweet: T Mobile coverage in my area is not the greatest. For beinging on the internet, talking on the phone and texting. I have had to hit send up to 5 times sometimes to get a text to go through.Customer service is awesome!!! Best I've ever experienced with any provider. So there it is.",1
I tried T-Mobile years ago and service was horrible.. now in 2022 it’s actually Improved quite a bit but the reason for my review is customer service.. with such a big company expanding more and more fhe customer service is horrible.. no when you call you always get someone who speaks broken English in another country and in the background it sounds like there are hundreds speaking another language.. to me this is not professional at all.. T-Mobile claims top tier service and top tier customer service.. hate to say the customer service is way below sub par.. it’s horrible,1
"Went to T -Mobile. Several displays stating I phone on us. Talked to lady and got the 55.00 a month package. First statement, 103 dollars. I go back and I didn’t say I was trading in my old phone. Well!!!! They didn’t say to get the I phone 13 on them I had to say I was trading in my old phone. After 4 , 30 mile round trips I did get the 55.00 dollar a month deal but I have to pay 33 dollars a month for 24 months.",1
"I purchased mobile hotspot with them.  Even though I canceled it they kept charging me.  I finally had to get the credit card company to investigate and they reversed the charges.  I had the email confirmation from when I canceled.  The service itself wasn't terrible, but there was times when the coverage wasn't nearly what they claim on their maps.  The 5G service is fast though so if you need that and they have coverage you won't be disappointed.",1
Service was excellent until they screwed me out of my trade in money. Was promised $300 trade in. They retroactively removed the trade in and never notified me. I just noticed the higher bill. Then they told me it was too late to do anything about it and kept my phone and money. Then two different CS told me they'd change my plan to a lower bill and didn't. Last straw... Vax mandates and firing employees. I'm out.,1
The 3stars go to our rep! He was fantastic! T mobile deserves a big zero! We have the phones for 2 days. Most calls dropped or no service. We are in a large city. We had Verizon for over 12+ years. Never dropped calls or no bars even outside standing in our street! Headed back to T mobile to return the phones and then to Verizon to get reliable phone service.,1
Canceled service 7 months ago. Called today t Mobil keeps charging me. Spoke with Jonathan who left me on hold for over 1 hour. He did tell me account was cancelled. I ask why t Mobil keeps billing me. He could not answer. Save yourself the trouble use any other providerHorrible customer service and any service.Should be ashamed how dishonest they are,1
"I dud call customer service tonight , and expend time to ask about new promotions, it was fine , but the service representative was no nice , because I did ask different questions and he star to getting nasty and unpolite and I was trying to purchase two phones on line and suddenly, he hang up the phone conversation on me , that is the problem with some representatives from tmobil overseas , they are not patience and they don't care abd this give a bad name to your company !!, they should hire better people and more educated ones and more professionals !!!!!!",1
"The service is fine, customer service is fine too. What pisses me off is they say when you order a new phone it will he 2 days maybe 3 days until you get it. I ordered it Monday and it literally just shipped today so wi won't be getting it until this Monday.. thats my only issue, if you state something your going to do, I expect you to do what you said...even more so with a company such as T-Mobile.",1
"Thanks for all the reviews. I was just about to accept their promotional offer of paying off my current phones to my provider, ATT. My wife suggested I look at the reviews first. Glad I did. I will not be switching over to T-Mobile based on all these negative reviews. They were very helpful.",1
I have been a t mobile customer for 7 years. I am happy with customer service and there prices. What I am not happy with is that someone was able to add a iphone to my account on 3/6/2021. And again on 5/4/2021 because the person that the store did not follow the added instruction for my account because i am a victim of identity theft. I am supposed to be the only one who can make changes to my account. As much as i like them i will be leaving them if this happens one more time.,1
The 4G service has really declined over the last few months after they focused more on setting up 5G in my area. I have an old iphone 7 and don't have 5G. My 4G LTE data is sooooo sloooooooow it's rediculous. Now I have to get a new $1000 phone in order to get decent data.,1
"T-mobile is an upgrade from the pre-paids like boost and straight-talk (I've used both).  Phone coverage is much improved.  But the data rates are lacking, even off-peak.  If you want to game you will need to do it when most people are at work or asleep in your area, otherwise you are getting powned by the zitty kid with the strong wifi connect.",1
"I read reviews about their dishonest warehouse & YES I CAN RELATE. I gave them a 3 star because they at least fixed my monthly rate for 2 months now after i called this in 8 months ago. Soo for 8 times, ive had to call, explain MY SITUATION, & stay on the phone for about 20 minutes OR MORE with DIFFERENT ASSOCIATES before the last one literally had managed it for 2 months now. BUT, the previous phone is STILL not off my line. They should send it back to me since i paid it for so many months before they adjusted the prices.",1
Wednesday I was here 3:00 and half hours had to come back today and they still got me and other people waiting.Here I am again. Just don’t make no since. When are these companies going to ever learn. Pay your employees more money and stop trying to work the ones you have to death. SMH. 🙁,1
"I had to send back the tablet that wasn’t right for me and since I paid initial payment for this iPad I need my money back.Looks like the Refund process in TMobile is terrible. I am waiting already 2 months...So I was charged in 1 min, but refund will take 2 month or more, still not sure when I will get it back . 😐 So my advice Think Twice if you’re not sure you Really want  that or other type device or you will wait to get your money back  money long time and spend time on calls.Definitely needs improvement.",1
"I refer a friend to get $50. But when I claimed the $50 they refused to give it to me. Another incident, I went to a T-Mobile store to make a payment. That young lady, one of the staff took a picture of my account with her personal cell phone. I asked her why she said because this computer is not working and I wanted to go to the other computer. I asked why did you take a picture of my account using your personal cell phone. She answered me in a non professional way. I put in a complaint with T-Mobile but they never got back to me and the staff is still working in the same location.",1
"I am annoyed with T-Mobile right now, they recently expanded international plans so it's great when you travel buy they got rid of a lot of calling discounts for different countries... I wound up with $60 of overages on my last bill because they failed to inform me. they did credit it but I'm still annoyed cause now I need to use Skype to call my family back home.",1
"Just started w/T-Mobile about 3/ 4 month. Been w/ US cellular for years, always having to watch for extra charges / changes on monthly bill, never the same.  T-Mobile- great friendly customer service, wish we could get better phone service, may have to change to another carrier due to running two businesses from cell phones.  Need more / better service from phones, I hope they can pull it together, I love my new phone, seems better set up.  PLEASE pass this info to the top to get some changes made fast....highly depend on phone service!  Thank you",1
I will never go into this store again.  They had little knowledge of the plan I wanted and one lady said it did not exist. They were the most belligerent employees I have ever had to deal with. I wanted to discuss a problem with the manager and he would not come out of his back room. Definitely not an asset to T-Mobile.  I went to the T-Mobile store in Deland and what a difference. Two ladies were extremely knowledgeable of the plan and very helpful in explaining what I had to do.  They spent a great deal of time setting up my WIFI Hotspot device in which the other store said it was not compatible with their system.  I cannot say enough about how well I was treated.  There names are Olivia and Stephanie.  Don't waste your time at the Saxon store and go to the Deland store,1
"I have been a loyal customer for 15 years. The service is decent, but, support sucks. you finally got 1 thing right. Praises for the ScamShield feature. I had been getting daily scam/robocalls. I am no longer getting them. It's about time you got something right.",1
"T Mobile needs to re-design the web site because it is difficult to use. I use the same password each time and it never works. Even after I get it to work, the system is not easy to navigate. The customer service is not any better either. The bill pay will take you all the way through with a response for the many questions and near the end, it will say...I will get you a representative but do not provide the representative. Other companies, you can pay by phone without the hassle.  T-mobile, I do not want to spend 30 minutes to one hour trying to pay a bill. Please make it simple.",1
"We've been with TMO for 4years. It's a matter of which poison do you take? All mobile carriers are suspect. However, we have 13 lines with TMO. Has been peachy, rosy and awesome? Heck NO. But we learn to work with our account manager and make the best of the situation.",1
Big shout out to T Mobiles Facebook agents. I left Verizon for enticement of cheaper more straight forward plans and coverage where I needed it with 5G. Well while prices were straight forward promised coverage was less then friendly and not there at all. I use my phone for work and personal including school and hotspot so it's not optional not to have service where needed. I reached out through the app via chat and to the local store and got the run around. The Facebook team resolved my issue which ended in a no charge to me end of my service enabling me to go back to my previous carrier. The Facebook team resolved my issue and made sure I was satisfied and are still checking in. The rest of the team should take lessons from them.,1
I was trying to get my phone unlocked and switch to Verizon. I got the phone from my boyfriends dad and there wound up being some kind of a charge issue on the account. I wound up calling and talking to two or three of the customer service people and went into the store even to try to figure out what was going on. It wasn't until I went into the store to get it unlocked that we discovered the charge. All the worker did was temporarily unlock it. So when I got back home I called again and talked to Matt in the KC store. He was so helpful and very patient. He's the best one I talked to.,1
"I signed up with T-Mobile 5 years ago and we thought they were the best company to work with as their customer service was the best I had ever experienced and i am 70 yrs old. Seems that since they were joined to Sprint the internet service has gotten more unreliable and the excellent level of T-Mobile customer service no longer exists.  You can't contact a phone rep unless you decide to give up an hour or two just on hold.  Don't even think of sending them an e-mail now, you just get an error message. I had always heard people in my area complain about Sprint and it seems as if Sprint's effect on T-Mobile has been a disaster for T-Mobile customers.",1
"UPDATE  THEY RESET MY DATA AND  DATA IS RUNINING AT 28MPS  NOW  > sold me unlimited hot spot plan  that moved at 2 MPS at times and others was 1MPS ! when i said cancel it they upped my bill $10 just to have same service  had  before and down graded data streaming i had grandfathered in,  my wifes phone only use 2 gigs a month  but her data is 3MPS most times some much for unlimited,They are a joke Unlimited is oversold it going back to ATT enterprise Hot spot and using phone App . Customer service LOL calll 3 times trying to unlock phones  and they cant get it done  will just root em  as its easier than dealing with these morons",1
I've been a customer for over twenty years. My complaint is they are constantly shoving the homosexual lifestyle down our throat in all there ads. While hoping to gain customers .,1
Our family was with T- Mobile for 4 years and things were fine and customer service reps were nice but when I tried to cancel our service I did not understand that I had some lines on the account that were open that were not in use that I was still being charged for. Each month I continued to be charged and would call and try to cancel but I kept being charged. I ended up having to pay an extra $369. I tried disputing the charge but T- Mobile sent me to a law firm. You think after four years of perfect payments they would have given the customer the benefit of the doubt. I just wanted to cancel. I will not be recommending T- Mobile to anyone I know which is unfortunate because I have six children and lots of siblings and friends.,1
Yeah. There's only a 14 day grace period if you don't want their service anymore. Thats with all cellphone services. Don't by anybody's word. I usually read the bylaws. Just FYI,1
"i would give 5 stars if danielle was the only one to help me - and 2 others whom i recommended to TMobile - move over to tmobile. i went to the 30 ave astoria tmobile and got speedy service. so i naturally recommended my brother who took out 2 lines also. however we discovered that Adam messed up IMEIs and colors so returning 2 lines had major issues. were it not for danielle we'd be leaving more reviews. bad reviews. it is not recommended to go to this tmobile unless you have danielle as the take charge person. the one thing you need is honesty, not luring customers in and misleading them. we felt adam did this. with free Netflix plus the mega mix up which tmobile took many days to sort out and only at Danielle's vouching for us.",1
"3 stars for offering service. Consumers listen...After i read online that tmobile got fined for hiding dropped calls. I had my own discovery. I called customer service several times because sometimes i had 3-4 bars of LTE service, yet no to limited data. It wasn't until my last call when a rep let it slip that there was no LTE towers within 15 miles of where i was. I believe they rig there phones with false representation and I left Tmobile. Also right off the bat i was offered a deal; buy a V20 get a free phone and with multiple lines we got a LG pad. After months i realized i was still charged. At 1st i called & a rep told me it would come off, then months later i called and rep said the deal ended. After pushing a lot, finally they upheld the deal.",1
"Been with them for 23 years. In all that time they have been great, horrible, problem solvers and lately, they are a mess! Im not gong to rehash my latest issues that have been finally resolved. This complaint is about the app. Two things. First, No way to email them. The one issue that really kills me is if I call customer service and there is a wait time, 75% of the time I will be offered a call back option. But try to find that on the web site or the app. I just spent from 6:38pm until 7:22pm trying to find where that feature is? I have been told many times to go to the app and schedule that call back. Yeah OK where? I am so angry right now. The only good thing is I don't have to be asked by the customer service representative if I would tell my friends and family how great they are and recommend them? It is better not to say what my response has been to that statement.",1
"I do not understand how I can pay for unlimited data and still get overage notices. I just got another one this morning. I do not understand why the billing practices are this way. Last time this happened I got a ""oh wow you were not on the right plan"" when I thought I was. So I changed everything and spent yet more money with them. Now here we are again almost a few years later with them telling me I'm going to run out of data.I really don't have anything more to say about them, the billing practices really do have a scummy vibe to them.Both my wife and I are starting to feel taken advantage of and it's getting to the point where we are starting to look at alternatives.T-Mob, you can do better then this. If $$$ is going to get the customer unlimited then just tell them that. If unlimited doesn't really exist on your network then stop calling it that.  This isn't right.",1
"UPDATE : T-Mobile has fixed the problem in a timely manner. Not sure if this posting had anything to do with the fix, but it has been resolved.I am no longer a ""fan"". I recently had to cancel my postpaid account due to money issues. My bill was finalized on the 18th but received a call from a collection agency today the 21st before I even received my final bill. It has already shown up on my credit report and dropped my score by 67 points. What did T-Mobile customer service say? We have no idea how your information was already sent out to a collection agency. I was planning on coming back as a prepaid account since I spend most of my data on wifi, but that has changed. Goodbye T-Mobile. And corporate was no help either. Same excuse. A loyal 20 year customer and that is what I get for doing my best to defend them... Horrible.",1
"T-mobile has a lot of fun perks that make it seem like your getting something really fun and exciting... but their network is quite terrible! No service at all in rural areas, on back roads, even in some suburban areas. We have an entire neighborhood paying for service but not getting any mobile internet or having it very limited or super slow for over a week now. I had to buy an internet pass from xfinitywifi. At least with Verizon I had a VERY reliable network, sure...it cost me an arm, a leg, and a kidney (j/k)  but I didn’t need the extra perks of netflix, T-Mobile Tuesday’s give aways , etc... I had reliable mobile internet without question. I have truly enjoyed T-Mobile’s affordable pricing, and their customer service is always super friendly but if their mobile internet issues and network issues are not fixed soon, we may be going back to Verizon.",1
Ever since they merged with Metro PCS the cell service has gone down hill significantly. I never have service anywhere and I’m not even in rural areas.,1
"Have been with them for over 3 yrs and everything was great until after paying my phones off with them last fall. Right  after that my account had an “authorized” charge in Houston for 2 newest model iPhone with all extras. I notified their fraud department and charges were taken off of my acct. Then again this week a female walked into a store here in my city by my house, and again bought 2 newest model iPhones with all extras. Both cases these woman acted and even signed documents as if it was me! And after the first theft there was a high alert added to my account which clearly didn’t work... Apparently I don’t even have the right to see the video recording of their faces - due to security reasons - even though both these crooks know who I am and even my address but my security just doesn’t concern anyone!  Lots of people telling me that it was an ‘inside’ job and I am done with this headache!",1
"I have been a T-mobile customer for MANY years...close to 20. Things have always been acceptable to me, a bit pricey, but everything always worked pretty well. I recently upgraded, and joined a 55+ program. That gives you a $20.00 break for being 55+, with a few strings attached. I already was doing what I needed to do to get the discount. Here's my complaint...They were able to fit my new equipment ($21.25 a month) into the billing cycle, but not my discount. Therefore they got $20.00 from me instead of $1.95. I don't know how corporate America sleeps at night. You can have the $20.00, but instead of a ""great"" review you get an ""average"" review. Sooner or later Karma will get you. Look at Sears with their predatory credit cards as an example. You should reward loyalty. I'm not somebody that lives and dies with my phone. I rate them as average. Nothing to rave about, and not much to complain about.",1
"T-Mobile used to have the best service before they merged with Sprint. Maybe they want to only work with brand new 5G phones. Phones that only do H+ ( HSPA ) and 4G LTE no longer get signal in many parts of the country. I will probably switch carriers so I have a usable phone. I plan to upgrade my 2-year-old phone to the Pixel 6 when it comes out later this year but I am not confident that it will work with T-Mobile either. I've always used Google phones because they have the least extra added software.There area where I have problems is in St Augustine Florida, Atlanta Georgia and l-75 going from St Augustine to Atlanta. Most of my issues are data issues. My phone is supposed to provide data for Android Auto and I also use Android Auto for my in car music. My phone issues are mostly in St Augustine where I would not be able to make a phone call from my home if my phone did not use my home internet service to make the phone call. They said there was supposed to be a new tower for southern St Augustine on July 4th but I saw no improvement.",1
"Hello, I work as an independant contractor in tech support and customer service for a high and spa company. I have been a loyal t-mobie customer for 4 years and have been referred T-mobile to many others. 4 days ago I received my new Galaxy S9. Today a client fell and knocked my phone on to a concrete surface craking the back of my phone in a spiderweb pattern. when I called about the insurance ths wanted a $99 deductable to replace it and would not cover my $1000 4 day old phone under warranty. I even offered to pay for the shipping. Lessoned learned! T-mobile does not warranty $1000 phones that are 4 days old and requires a $99 deductable after paying $1000 4 days prior. I will not refer anyone else and am now thinking about switching to xfinity mobile. I use my phone for business. My years of loyalty and $1000's spent means nothing to this company! Now off to the BBB for the legalities... Thanks a bunch for taking advantage of a sole proprinter and a fluke accident",1
I really have liked t-mobile for years but their phone customer service has fallen off a cliff the last few months unfortunately.,1
"I use T-Mobile and I give them 5 stars for free data across the world, but 1 star for the coverage, so I end up at 3 stars. :-/",1
"4651 w 6th st.Excellent service, very knowledgeable, really helpful with their suggestions.",1
I have no problems with calling but their internet connection is sometimes slow.,1
"T-mobile, after the BBB got involved, you finally attempted to make it right, the check got lost in the mail one more time, and you tried to short me again (you clearly don't have enough money, just ask Sprint) but all in all you finally corrected the mistake. So I'm changing you to a 3 star.I went to get my son's phone repaired at a independent service, and they could  not do it that day, right next door was T-Mobile. So we went in and we looked in to 2 new phones on 3 or 4 lines. I chose two phones that were both approx. $250. After hours like 3 hours and a card swipe of over $700 the clerk asks me if I wanted to put the 2nd phone on the leasing program. I was blown away, I said what did the $700 pay for and he mumbled some things with a heavy Spanish accent. I asked for the receipt and was told it would be emailed later. So I just left. Now we are signed up for service have only one phone, and have no idea what is going on. In order to see the receipt, you have to create an online account. I see there are employee assist charges, activation charges, deposits. I'm all the way out. I return under the 14 day policy and they give me all the money except the $180 deposit. That will come in the mail. well its been almost two months, no refund. So I call and they finally find the documents (which I can no longer access) and do a little math, apparently on one phone that was active we had to pay $70 for service, and the visa card has been mailed out. I never received it, ok, here's a number to Citibank to report it lost and go through that whole process. I literally give up, keep it T-Mobile. you are terrible",1
"TMobile vs Straight talkSo not to long ago I switched from straight talk to TMobile. I expected to have a better overall plan, reasonably priced, and to have faster LTE speeds. About a month into using TMobile I have really not noticed a change, in fact the speeds were anything but fast. I have lost service all together many times,it has reverted back to 3G a few times, more often then straight ever did. Their 4G must not have much coverage or something and lacks the performance I would expect from a higher end phone company. I compared it to my straight talk account (it's still active because the plan was paid for when I switched)  and I did a speed test for mps. Straight talk speeds were significantly higher compared to TMobile. In fact they were double the speed. I wanted to compare playing a 1080p video running on just mobile data. TMobile had a hard time loading the video as it buffered several time throughout the video. While straight talk on the other hand had no problems playing the high frame rated video,it didn't buffer or cut out once. Now as far as plans go, I  am on TMobile one plus, Supposedly I get 2x higher speed LTE over the other plans. Now it is a great deal or all it offers,10mps in flight LTE, I can text and what not in other countries, and and if I add another line they pay for Netflix.  But the plan is only $75 and I pay $90. What are the $15 in fees for? What are the fees? Straight talk offers unlimited high speed LTE, talk and text for only $55 and only has about $5 in fees. Ithink it's safe to say (for me anyway) TMobile still has a ways to go before their service is better. I think I'll stick with straight talk for the moment.",1
"Honestly, T-Mobile has been a great service ever since I switched over to them from Sprint but their ""360 Protection"" plan is an absolute scam and complete waste of money. I was paying $13 a month for a year a half after after I broke my previous phone and figured why not get insurance so the process is simpler and I can avoid having to pay full price again for a new phone. My current phone finally breaks and I find out that my $350 phone (now not even worth $120 brand new) won't be replaced without paying a $100 deductible. I could understand $100 maybe if I had a flagship phone but this was just insane considering I found my phone refurbished and like new selling online for around the same price.Long story short, do NOT get the phone insurance unless maybe you have a really expensive phone, and even still, I can see them still charging a ridiculous deductible that almost negates having the insurance to begin with. I mean, even with my middle range phone the deductible was more than it cost to just get another phone online. So yeah, do the math, $13 x 18 months = $234 that could have bought me the brand new version of my current phone where T-Mobile is simply giving me a pre-owned refurbished phone and STILL charging me $100 for the replacement, so really, it's costing me $324 to get a crumby replacement when I could easily buy an even better phone than my current one, brand new.So yeah, I give T-Mobile 3 stars because I love everything else about them but their insurance is just an awful scam. Too many hoops to jump through and then they'll still charge you through the nose just to get an even worse version (refurbished) of your current phone. Assurant is the company they use for their phone insurance. I know my rage should be focused solely on Assurant, but T-Mobile did decide to use them, so they still get a lot of the blame.",1
Not the best but decent,1
"Hmm, some of the experiences I have read here are what I experienced with Verizon! Verizon is the reason I switched to T-Mobile! I was with Verizon for 22 years with a perfect account (no lates or anything) and since 2017 it has been an absolute nightmare. Customer service is literally impossible to reach!I switched to T-Mobile about one month ago and the experience from day one has been the exact opposite of Verizon. I started calling T-Mobile a month before I switched peppering them with questions and concerns and being very skeptical. I heard promises that I also heard from Verizon which made me hesitate, but there has been one difference: T-Mobile has made good on every one of them! Customer service is dead easy to reach and every rep before sale and after sale has been personable and professional with the juice to get things done!I just got off the phone with them again telling them of my experiences with them and strongly stating that I hope this is not just a honeymoon! So far, everything they have promised and done has been backed up in writing as well!As for coverage, I was reluctant to leave Verizon coverage, but so far T-Mobile has proven to be at least a close second if not equal! On top of that, my monthly bill is $8 less than Verizon and I have unlimited minutes. With Verizon I had 700 minutes (although I never came close to using even 100 minutes in a month).So far, T-mobile has been a pleasure.UPDATE:Well, I need to lower my star rating by at least one. I have now been with T-Mobile for 1.5 months and the writing is on the wall now. I’m afraid it may be the beginning of the end for T-Mobile. I have recently started receiving ads via phone and email for “T-Mobile medical alert alarms” and “T-Mobile Banking Services”.Neither of these have anything to do with mobile phone service and represent a desperate money grab attempt. Too many pots on the burners and a few will boil over. I have seen this happen over a hundred times with other companies, both similar and different. They start offering unrelated services and get overwhelmed with negative experiences because they lose focus on the core business. Eventually, customer service suffers to the point of disappearing all together and employee moral goes in the toilet as all the service reps and technicians are fired. Customers can’t get help and eventually the company goes under. Sometimes it takes a few years and sometimes a few months.I left Verizon after 22 years due to this exact thing. They no longer have any customer service and tell you flat out that they don’t care. They don’t even have a customer retention team anymore!Next, I expect to see T-Mobile offering car insurance, life insurance and other scams.If T-Mobile keeps going down this path, they will fold. I’ll be leaving them before that happens.",1
"Update:  hurray!!!  T-Mobile credited our mobile account $784.94!I posted a story on the company’s FB page with hashtag TMobile and their customer service page and my FB page.  This detailed the facts on our reward and how we did not receive what was promised on the Bring Your Own Device promotion this last Fall (which is a current program too).After waiting over the requisite month for the reward payment and reaching out to Tmobile multiple times I was repeatedly and firmly denied by customer service at all levels in all departments.Having had enough frustration with “customer service” I reached out to the BBB and the FCC and was at the point of contacting our State’s Attorney General.I might note too that I did get an immediate response from the Tmobile T-force team when I hashtagged TMobile on their Facebook page, my FB page and the Tmobile customer feedback page. After lengthy messaging (don’t give up on that thread of communication) the T-force folks promised to try another claim and offer a full credit as a last resort in 2 weeks (which was today).I highly encourage anyone who gets shut down by Tmobile when you file your claim for reward to not give up. Hit them from the social media side and/or the offical complaint side with BBB.I was thrilled to get what was promised and look forward to a better relationship with TMobile.Don’t give up!  And let me know if you need encouragement in your attempt.Here’s the original story:We have been customers with another cellular service for nearly 20 years.  There are 4 phone users in my family.  We made the bold move to “bring your phone” to #T-Mobile and paid off 2 of our remaining contracts and were promised we would receive up to $800 for the move to T-Mobile.  Before crossing over to the new network we sent in our screenshots to T-Mobile and filled out the paperwork.  We were advised we would need to wait 6-8 weeks for the credit from T-Mobile.  After waiting for 3 months we called customer service and were told our paperwork was never filed and that we were past the one month deadline to re file our paperwork to receive our promotional amount.  When we were transferred to the promotional dept they said the same and that customer service would “escalate” this case and contact us.  No contact.  We called customer service in another week or two and were now told that the 2 month deadline had elapsed 5 days before our follow up call and that nothing could be done since we missed the deadline.  All this to say that we filed everything the day T-Mobile got 4 new customers to sign up with them.  They did not send us any of what we were promised, denied receiving our paperwork, told us we only had one month to file the paperwork, then told us they had extended that deadline to 3 months, and then told us that we did not meet any of their deadlines even with repeated calls to their reward dept and their customer service department.  I spent over a 6 hours speaking with representatives at T-Mobile feeling like I had when I was with AT&T.  I had hoped we were not dealing with another corporate company who just shuffled us around, but I soon learned T-Mobile was treating us the same way: with little regard for us as long term customers paying monthly.  We did nothing wrong on our end.  Is this the way a phone service treats its newest LONG term customers?  I will tell everyone our story when they say that T-Mobile is making promises to get new customers!  This might help you consider too what phone company you would like to pay monthly for multiple years.",1
"I have been a Sprint customer for 16 years and recently became notified via text message that I had to acquire a T-Mobile SIM card as they have merged. The options were to have the card shipped to me for $10 or to go to a store. I chose to go to a store to avoid the shipping costs and reduce the possibility of error. The closest store is about 30-40 miles from my home. I went to the store and was given the SIM to take home. The woman in the store told me how to do it and told me where to go to watch a video on the process. I asked her to do it for me, she would not, so I went home and watched the video to do it myself. **In small writing on one insert in the SIM card box, it states that you need to back up your voicemails or you will lose them. It does not say this in the video, and the woman in the store did not tell me. I did not notice and I lost all of my voicemails. That is not the purpose of my review though.** I put the SIM in my phone exactly as instructed, and my phone no longer worked. It would not connect to wifi. It would not connect to service. It was a locked and useless piece of technology. I used my landline phone to call customer service. I remained calm and tried to work with the agents to restore the use of my iPhone. The first agent attempted to assist me for 6 minutes before disconnecting me. I called back and got another agent that was especially kind. She attempted to help me for about 25 minutes before determining that she would not be able to assist me because I did not have a way to receive the one time code that she needed to send me in order to verify my account, and apparently my SIM card was faulty/did not exist. Because my phone didn't work, there was no way to receive the code to dive further in to this issue. We eventually found a way for me to receive the code, which was done by me emailing my mom from my laptop to ask her to receive the code and send it to me via email. She put me on hold to discuss with her team and then transferred me to another agent without telling me she was doing so. The new agent was not briefed on the situation so I got him caught up to speed and he attempted to help me for about 55 minutes, in the process, he guided me through phone resets that were unsuccessful in restoring the use of my phone, but they were successful in removing every setting, password, and face ID that were in my phone. He did not tell me that that would happen. At the time, I was just wanting to restore the use of my phone and wasn't even focused on the extent of what I had just lost. He disconnected me without warning. I called back and was connected with an agent that simply informed me that there was no way to help me and that I needed to travel back to a T-Mobile store and then disconnected me. I called back and was connected to an agent that assisted me for 47 minutes, ultimately resolving the initial problem and getting my phone activated to T-Mobile service. He also offered to send me a booster at no cost to increase service in my home. He discovered that there is only one T-Mobile tower in my area (there were 7 Spring towers) and that my service would be poorly effected by this switch. I was grateful for his help and his willingness to go above and beyond to help me with issues beyond what I was calling for. He was not able to help me restore my voicemails or my lost passwords/other information, but that is certainly not his fault. Every agent was pleasant, I had no personal issues with any of them, but they were not able/willing to help me and didn't seem to really care about the situation I was in. He thanked me for staying calm and kind and acknowledged how frustrated I must have felt. I would like to rate my last agent, Christian, every star in the world, because without him, T-Mobile would have lost a 16 year customer yesterday. I spent many hours of my day trying to do what they asked of me - not something I ever wanted - and it was a major inconvenience that caused a lot of stress. As far as I can tell, the only thing T-Mobile has done right is hire Christian. He deserves a lot of praise, and a raise. Christian, if you see this - please know how grateful I am. That is all, thanks.",1
"I've had TMobile for 14 years and have seen them improve greatly in the last 6 of those. I've always lived in an urban/suburban area and have had solid signal with very good coverage and data speeds. The LTE speeds in the 3-4 years have been excellent. Their customer service approach (teams with regional focus and follow-up to resolution) is far better than the past, and I had no reason to believe that would change according to inner reports from friends who are employees.In September of 2017 I noticed a drastic change in customer service policy/procedure - more calls to 611 than in the past were routed to overseas call centers who 1) had little ability/authority to resolve matters 2) struggled with the English language in their communication 3) couldn't relate to social and practical issues like addresses that directly affect US customers - all of which became more of a 'reading off a script' experience and endless cyclical talking that went nowhere.   In addition, any Twitter support through DirectMessaging was focused on hyper positivity, lofty rhetoric, exaggerated claims of expertise, and writing too much about themselves in an attempt to sympathize and empathize in obvious relatability - all which would be fine if accompanied with competence, accuracy, attention to detail, follow through, and a timely resolution. Because of these changes in customer service approach/policy, issues that formerly took days to a week to resolve now become lingering problems that last weeks to a month or more.I moved to a suburban/rural area that is still within a couple miles of a larger city, and according to antenna search/locator sites and an app called Network Cell Info Lite, there are several T-Mobile towers in my area, from 1/2 to 4 miles away with only one obstructed by geography (foothill). I never connect to the closest 4G tower, leading me to believe it's inactive or non-functioning. Doing drive tests with the diagnostic app reveal a very weak signal being br oadcast by most of the towers in the area, and even with full signal reception on phone (bars) the latency is very bad and data speeds are horrible and subpar - more akin to that of 3G or less.All of this information has been passed and communicated to TMobile over the past 4 weeks with little more than 'there are geographical difficulties' being reported from the engineers in the field.  This is only true of 1 out of the 6+ towers in the area.  I understand business decisions of cost vs benefit, and that unless/until a large customer base was complaining of problems they would delay or refrain from addressing such issues, but it seems there exists a lack of maintenance and ongoing upgrade concern/competence.  All the happy-talk virtue signaling in the world from customer service reps doesn't alter that.So I'm now experiencing what many others in 'less than adequate' coverage areas have experienced and the apparent changes in customer support have only exacerbated the frustration and unacceptable conditions.  This is my 2Cents.You can't trust their coverage map claims which are misleading, false, and blatantly full of errors.However, if you live in an area where towers are maintained and the signal is strong, their service is one of the best.  They really need to think through and work on their customer service approach - once again.**UPDATE 11/07/2017**After multiple attempts to contact a customer care or technical support person within the US by phone, I got lucky and reached a first level tech support person who transferred me to the 2nd level support. They took extensive notes and then created a ticket to be sent to engineers - meanwhile I created such an uproar on public Twitter messages that I was contacted by DirectMessage and they requested to call me directly to resolve the problem.During all of this, I continued to search for answers/solutions online. None of the support personnel directed or linked me to any T-Mobile online support documentation - but in my searches I found what I thought might be the problem. There was a detailed T-Mobile support document that did indeed provide some helpful information and could've been forwarded or linked or sent to me within the first day or two.Solution? The Personal Cellspot 4G LTE mini tower needed a complete 'reset', which can be accomplished by holding down the reset button on the back of the mini tower for 20+ seconds.  Up to this point, I had only tried 10 and 15 seconds as well as unplugging it for 30 minutes.  Once I did the 20+ second reset, the data speeds returned to a normal level (80-90mbits down, 30-45mbits up) and all was well.  I relayed all of this information - including the support documentation URL to T-Mobile support teams on Twitter and phone support and hopefully they will begin a process of searching for 'known issues' and FAQ's while assisting customers in order to actually resolve issues and to learn themselves in the process.",1
"4 calls with Customer Services - maybe 90 mins in total - to fix a router VOIP problem following an upgrade in our Fibre contract. 16 days with garbled incoming calls.The third Customer Services agent was the first to properly listen to my narrative, check what had been tried previously, seek more expert input, and do what she promised to do.Would Vodafone please consider a small gesture of compensation for the time, inconvenience, and inability to provide a proper landline service for 16 days?Edit 19 Jan:With reference to Vodafone's generic reply, the landline issue was resolved after 16 days. I can't pursue a rebate of charges, since I don't use fB, X or Instagram. What do you propose?",1
"I purchased an 8 day euroroaming bundle recently on a trip to Italy. Data and texts worked fine, but calls…..no. I could call the uk but could not call any Italian numbers without incurring extra charges. Calls from Italian numbers to my phone didn’t connect. This made life difficult with Italian friends and family and ordering pizza etc etc.",1
"Mobile broadband service (Gigacube). Well, the good thing is I now sometimes have Wi-Fi as being in the countryside makes it difficult to good Wi-Fi, hence the 3 stars. Overall, the signal is patchy. But, during one of the windy days a pylon that gave us signal got damage and our Wi-Fi stopped working. We were without Wi-Fi for 3 weeks! My partner works from home you can imagine the inconvenience this caused having to balance the 1 car between us to drive to and from a library or cafe every day to get Wi-Fi and just about be able to work and at the same time drive to my office as I work there 5 days a week. After 4 phone calls and hours on the phone, I got a refund for some of the days we had no Wi-Fi (10 out of the 21 days). This came to £16.67. What. A. Joke. So stingy it's unreal. To be clear, I pay £50 per month for my Gigacube contract. The people on the phone were nice don't get me wrong. But damn, their slimy policies and inability to fairly treat customers will kill this company. I'll be switching at the first opportunity.",1
"I generally don't have an issue with Vodafone..calls are generally answered quickly and efficiently with politeness..which is fine..HOWEVER...Call handler put me on hold but didn't turn his mic off..to quote what he said..""We have online another complaining White trash Mother Fu**er""...THAT call has been recorded....",1
I ordered a new phone and used the click and collect service... I had a email to say my phone would be ready for me to collect 4th January 2025 - however I had no notification that the phone I had ordered wasn't in stock in the store.. I've tried to find out how long it would be for you to have the phone delivered to the store and how long it would be until my order is ready to collect and haven't been successful... Could anyone help please??,1
"First two visits were generally very positive.  In general, I get good support and service when I go in with any issues.  Today's visit was, sadly, far from satisfactory.  The person I dealt with seemed very uneasy.  The system was down, so I couldn't process or confirm what I had found online.  My salesperson used his own phone and gave me a quote which was around £10 more than my cheapest online quote.  So I did the same process on my phone and came up with my original price.....This visit certainly didn't come up to the standard I'm used to from this store.  I know it can't be helped if the systems are down, but to get quotes that conflict by such a significant amount doesn't exactly encourage a spirit of optimism.....",1
"Vodafone UK's Eltham branch has some friendly and helpful staff, like Mike and Montana. They assist well with data transfers and explaining broadband options, ensuring I felt informed rather than confused. Demi also provided great advice and support for account setup and cancellations. Overall, while the staff is commendable for their service, there's room for improvement in overall experiences.",1
"After a disappointing installation and little help in setting up, via the App and instruction sheet, it's now performing well, with good, consistent speeds.If it carries on like this for a few weeks it'll be up to 4*",1
"Appalling customer service tools. Phone line cuts me off when trying to connect to an advisor; they did call back to be fair but they couldn't provide any help as it was an 'external' call.Online chat they don't answer or it automatically times you out; times out very quickly so you need to keep typing something very frequently (they actually advise you to do that - mad). Utterly useless.Finally got my issue (regarding PAC) thanks to a very helpful advisor called Christine, so that's one positive point to feedback.",1
"The telephone Internet get worse. I am at my home in York City centre and I have no Internet every afternoon and now on a Saturday Sunday very little in the morning  and evening always unstable,  the quality and reliability has drastically reduced in Poole  Dorset too.All the local shop can say is it when the network is very busy.  I have had a new sim card and my phone is a new samsung galaxy...I know many others are commenting too ...the service provided is not fit for purpose.I had no stable Internet until 21.00hrs on saturday all checks have been done just too busy on the network your shop tells me.",1
Ok but constant issue with phone calls dropping and 4/5g connectivity problems. Was with EE before and never had any problems at all. Certainly needs some improvement to make me sign another contract,1
"If you have the benefit of speaking to a UK support team the experience is personable and professional.However the website/app experience is dreadful.The painful experience of attempting to log onto your account is a real put off. Codes, usernames, one off passwords, PIN numbers and I could go on.As for the on line chat Bot, Tobi, it must be the most useless experience and waste of time. Don’t even bother trying to communicate with it, ring the call centre direct.",1
"They are expensive, do not reward long customers, deal with problems badly.After 22 years I am ending my association with Vodafone. I have been charged an inflationary price for sim only and mobile internet which I can save 30 pounds a month by switching. When someone hacked my phone and ran up excessive 0800 calls over my monthly contract, Vodafone dealt with it clumsily, restricting my phone access until they received payment on two separate occasions.No apologies were offered when I complained.",1
"Update!Having posted on Trustpilot about being charged for a phone contract that had been cut off, I had a call the very next day from Vodaphone saying that they would refund my money as clearly there had been a misunderstanding and I shouldn't have been charged. A great result.",1
"I've been with Vodafone since around 2011 when i got my first iphone and my experience with them has genuinely been good altough data signal has been bad this last year, my contract came up for renewal and i wanted to go to a pay as you go, they told me on the phone i couldn't switch and keep my phone number and offered me deals that were too expensive with either too much data or too little so i switched to O2, i now am paying less and i also get 5G ! i never got 5G with Vodafone even though i was paying for it for 2 years, i would only get it if i was in my town or a city. Happy i swicthed after all these years and disappointed Vodafone couldn't help out a loyal customer.",1
"The service I received in store was very direct and didn't have to wait to be seen.The shop assistant that served me seemed initially very uninterested and condensing towards my questioning. I felt almost patronised against because  of asking whwt he odvsiously deemed as silly questions made clear from his eye rolling and huffing. He even kept dropping my bank card on the table instead of handing it back to me as well as the receipt being folded and casually thrown across to me.He clearly picked up on my mood changed in reaction to this and clutched at some sort of small talk which frankly I had lost interest in. I just wanted to get the upgrade sorted and leave the store by this point.I will have to go back to the store in a few months for a device upgrade, but really do not want to be served by this staff member.He did do what was asked of him but I felt rather belittled by him.",1
"We have broadband with Vodafone it I cheap and drops out quite often but generally ok, don't expect the best.",1
"After one month of confusion in which I spent hours on the phone trying to prevent Vodafone from cutting me off, I give credit to their staff for trying to resolve the issue and offering me a generous compensation payment. I won't know till next month whether the issue has finally been sorted out but am keeping my fingers crossed. No problem with the technical side but the administration has been chaotic.",1
"Vodafone Blackburn Town Centre, nice and helpful guys but the system is rubbish. I waited a lot because the system was not processing the info correctly",1
"After 5 calls with various members over the past month, they failed to tell me that I cannot change my number from a pay monthly to a pay monthly.Looks like the company will only reply to 5 star reviews.",1
"Most of the time it works ok, I got a good deal on my top internet speed which is stable most of the time, however can't say much about their app. I put it on a new phone yesterday got it working fine then today I try to sign in again and it wants all my details again like a lost password procedure, I know am retired but I still don't have all the time in the world to be faffing around with sign-in procedures. I've taken the app off its useless. I wanted to chat with someone as my landline is not working, the phone works at my daughter's but not here. The issue is obviously with Vodaphone. Update: Thanks vodaphone I did try that but it still wants me to go through all the sign up procedure again. My landline is now working now anyway.",1
"Let's be clear, the operator in the shop was extremely attentive, several years of experience of the software, knowledgeable & helpful. Clearly the computer systems they are working with are old, cumbersome & slow, which hampers shop staff in handling enquiries & making sales efficiently & speedily.",1
"Well, I'm rather disappointed. I wanted to join Vodafone, but after less than 24 hours, I've canceled my SIM card. The coverage checker and my signal don't match up, and it's the same as my current provider, only twice the price. If they had reduced the price by 5 pounds a month, I would have continued with my 24-month contract, but I'm not paying double the price for a marginally better service! It is great that you offer the 14-day cancellation period, though.",1
"37 minutes to renew broadband contract, like for like.  How inefficient for both Vodafone to have a chat agent tied up for that time, but also poor customers who have to go through the painful process.If I can renew contracts elsewhere with just the click of a few buttons, why does it have to be so onerous with Vodafone ?",1
"Couple of weeks in and unable to make outgoing calls on landline at the moment ? In fairness, complaints are very quickly acted upon but having tried on several occasions to see what the problems is. I changed to Vodafone as they were offering a much cheaper service and faster internet, although I've since found out that the figures quoted are based on cable connection rather than wifi ? who connects with a cable these days ? very misleading but presume other providers do the same ?",1
"I bought a sim only contract. My worst ever experience with any mobile network. It’s 4g network. When I bought it I wasn’t aware that it is 4g. Unable to open bus app, bank app, YouTube and other social media apps. They keep increasing monthly charges. I’m just paying for nothing. Apart from all very poor customer service. Never helped. Thousands customer like me just paying these companies for nothing.",1
"I did not apply for £150 gift card in time because I received a no fault eviction notice and so I was worried about becoming homeless.  So I had to put all my time and attention for months on to finding somewhere to live and moving.  After several calls and speaking to a manager and they did nothing.  Even though I explained this is a lot of money for me as I’m not able to work due to health reasons.Also, I moved home and had a new line put in.  I had to stay with Vodafone because I had a contract.  I was without internet for about 5 days.  The engineer burst my heating water pipe.  After the pipe had been fixed, all the water had to be drained from my heating and then the heating had to go on maximum for an hour.  Then it had to dry out for weeks before the wall was plasterboarded and painted.  It took so much of my time up and took months to be resolved.  I received £3.90 of compensation from Vodafone!  AVOID VODAFONE BROADBAND PLEASE!Update it has since been half resolved.",1
"Decided to change our broadband to full fibre with Vodafone for a ""seamless transfer."". Two lads turned up on the day, on time, layed the cable, drilled the necessary holes and tested it - didn't work. An obstruction in the cabling down the road was diagnosed. We were told a man would arrive the next morning to sort it.Nobody arrived, nobody contacted us. Eventually I rang Vodafone (not easy!) and got through to the installations team. I was told that there was a problem in the cabling (we knew that!) and that someone would call to resolve it on 12 November (13 days later). That we didn't know! No amount of arguing could persuade them to do it earlier; they just blamed City Fibre. I ended the call very frustrated and not a little angry. No contact from them since, no confirmation of the 12 November, no faith in Vodafone. That is a ""seamless transfer"".  MORE - I have added a star as the Trustpilot review galvanized Vodafone into action - we now have broadband up and running. BUT the phone line doesn't work! I have phoned twice, received assurances, even called in a Vodafone shop, but still no telephone. Will contact them again later in the week but very frustrating.",1
"Spent hours trying to cancel my upgraded broadband.Passed from dept to dept and still no further in after hours.To renew or take out the contract was perfect but customer services seem non existent when you need to cancel! very disappointed with Vodafone.  Used to be amazing customer service.Updated, managed to get through to a really helpful advisor who understood and fixed the problem.  Need more guys like this!",1
"This review would have been no stars out of five if it wasn't for Jack and his manager at the Vodafone store in the Grand Arcade, Cambridge. Thank you to them my problem was fixed. Was left feeling frustrated by making a number of calls to 191 after i lost reception in mid December and numerous advisers trying to resolve the issue. Now waiting to learn what kind of compensation Vodafone will offer for being without a service for the best part of half a month.",1
"There seem to be plenty of areas where improvement would definitely help ratings!I recently waited 3 or 4 days for my new SIM to become operational,  due, it seems, to online customer service incompetence. However I would like to thank Sophie at the Basingstoke shop who sorted the problem in minutes :)One major point to address  I feel is the reliance of the customer having access to a 2nd phone to which verification codes can be sent! When you've lost your phone you don't HAVE a phone!!..........  Think about it Vodafone.",1
I have contacted Vodafone through the chat. During the 2h chatting to the Vodafone team about an hour and. Half was about security questions and connecting me to the right team. The other 30 min was just resetting the router and raising a ticket to the appropriate team. 2 weeks without internet and 2 hours lost. If you need to contact them do not use the chat.Update: I called the Vodafone team and my issue was resolved quickly and efficiently.,1
"Generally fine. Vodafone in general are a very difficult company to deal with. Spent four hours today trying to do a very simple task, so had to go into my local store to resolve. Got my issue sorted without too much fuss.",1
"Vodafone took over an hour instore with very helpful staff trying to change a sim only monthly contract to a different level.  I was told there is a problem with Vodafone's online system when a  phone number has previously been pay as you go and it's been a problem for several years.  I left the store without the issue being sorted with the promise of an email follow up when it's done. SORT IT OUT, VODAFONE, YOU'RE A TECH COMPANY.  STOP WASTING CUSTOMERS' TIME.",1
"Chloe who i dealt with was polite and efficient.However her assumed manager ( older male ?) Was less so. My phone screen was faulty and he insisted it was because I had damaged it although he agreed there was not any evidence of damage or any impact mark on the phone ( because there had been none). Seemed more bothered about been sat on his phone at the back of the store then supporting his co workers. Chloe, an asset to your store, him however not",1
"Good mobile coverage, fast, and mobile over WiFi are great, but website and app are dismal - it's like they've never been tested.  Both are confusing to use when managing your account, unintuitive, slow, and regularly crash or throw error messages.  Both are really poor - even trying to renew my contract today, both the app and website are hanging/throwing error messages.  Such a bad impression having these failures in a sales process!",1
"Efficient, helpful and friendly is how I would describe Dan, the guy who served me in Darlington. I requested that he add £10 credit on PAYGO 1 to my phone. He confirmed that I understood how PAYGO 1 works and then credited it to my phone.Later that day I discovered that Vodafone had actually added a bundle which would expire in a months’ time.I contacted Live-chat and the error was corrected by Erik.All's well the ends well.",1
"I moved my house back in November, had many conversations assuring that the old address is disconnected and contract was going to be cancelled. But they continued to charge me for several months, lost chat history. Just unbelievable.._Update_: After almost 3h in a chat, I happened to talk to a person who was able to find the disconnection request for 4th of December. Hopefully this will be sorted out now.",1
Broadband connection ‘engineer’ expected today between 8am and 1pm. No show by 1pm so called Vodafone to be told ‘engineer’ running late but will attend before 6pm. No show by 6pm so further call to Vodafone. Apologetic but offering unsuitable appointments a week hence. Finally offered and accepted a new appointment 2 weeks hence. The point is we had to make all the running with zero communication from Vodafone during the day. Not a good start to our new broadband relationship with Vodafone. On the plus side the Vodafone customer person did their best.,1
"I received great service from Vodafone throughout my 2 years, until my contract came to the end. Vodafone continued to take money from my bank account even though my contract had been cancelled and I had successfully transferred my number to my new provider.What a shame it had to end on such a bad note. And not even an apology from Vodafone when I asked for my money back.I did expect better service from such a reputable company.",1
"I would have given Vodafone more stars had I not moved to Spain, where I found their roaming charges ridiculously expensive. It’s cheaper to pay the basic monthly contract charge, to which I’m tied for two years for no service at all and use a Spanish Sim for my telephone and 4g/5g needs.",1
Been a customer for 2 yrs - broadband and landline. Connection was easy enough to set up and received router promptly. Speeds very consistent and got what I paid for 37mbp/s.However disappointed by mid-contract price rises above inflation. Also upon termination mandatory 30day termination notice despite coming to the end of the contract. For this reason Im unlikely to return - there are better value providers.,1
"Purchased a new Samsung Galaxy mobile on the 7th Dec from Vodafone store in Sunderland , travelled back & forth numerous times to get mobile working without any success . even the Store manager tried but no luck, Finally decided to return the mobile on Fri 29th Dec for a refund , Sales Advisor DONNA asked if she could sort out the problem & HEY PRESTO she did , so DONNA well done , the rest must try harder , Cheers Ann",1
Had Vodafone WiFi provider since 2020 and it was bad at first. Connection is absolutely amazing for a 4 bedroom. Before you get onto me… yes I’ve seen the reviews with customer service.. but when is customer service these days any good? Anyway back to the point. The WiFi signal was outstanding and is quite good for playing stuff online and can have multiple devices using it at once. Had things like PCs PlayStations alexas etc and never had a problem with laggy or slow WiFi with a lot of devices connected to it.Overall if you’re looking for some good WiFi I’d go to Vodafone but I wouldn’t rely on customer service.👍🏻,1
"I have no issue with the home broadband service provided by Vodafone UK. It is pretty reliable and offers the speed advertised. Their broadband hub isn’t good, but I use my own WiFi router & APs behind it.However, if you do need it, their customer service is as bad as it gets. The people you can chat to are perfectly pleasant. But they are under-trained and clearly have minimal system support. The result is that they can achieve nothing to help their customers. It is almost like they are being paid to waste both their time and the customer’s time. I also note that their TOBi pre-chat system is a prize example of ‘Artificial Stupidity’ – carefully designed to waste customer’s time. Even when you manage to connect to a person, TOBI is still waiting to get you. So, for another account security check, it will ask you for the same information again and again, because it only looks at your last reply.",1
"Do your research as vodafone mobile sim only tariff for £10 with 100GB data. It isn't  that good as it don't include ""roam like home."" So you have to pay a minimum of £7 to use your phone in Europe.I will stick with my £8 tariff with o2  with 50GB and 25GB data in Europe include at no extra cost.You would only need 100GB if you want to also use it at home as your broadband.Vodafone need to check what other mobile companies are before coming with something that isn't that good.So make sure you check what is included with your tariff.still Vodafone don't bother looking into it and come with lame excuses as usual, so be careful with Vodafone mobile tariffs as they probably are not a good deal.",1
"Why is it ( I am sure not just Vidafone) difficult to leave these companies.They make it diificult to leave. Threaten of charges which can be heavy.No one contact or tell you to contact during the day , which never have time.I have been with Vodafone for many years . Now paying far too much for the service reception has become bad on mobile data which I know it is noty phone causing this.I am considering Voxi which I believe is part of Vodafone. Nothing so simple.Vodafone - why dont you help your customers.I expect thix womt get to Vodafone but feel better writing this",1
"Bruno was great upgrading my phone to the Iphone 14 + and transferring my information, thank youBruno did do a great job at updating my phone BUT he wrote this review NOT me ! Presumably while he had access to my phone. I am not pleased that while Bruno had access he chose to write his own review without informing me. I would have happily given him a good review but this has somewhat annoyed me and I find it disrespectful.",1
"Jamie bent over backwards to help with my broadband issue.  Although not resolved in store he walked me through instructions to rectify this at home. Very impressed!However, things did not go so well at home. The online chat was tortuous and crashed after an hour - I then started another chat for another half hour only to be told to call a number.  I spoke to a lady in Egypt who was helpful but it took around 3 hours to resolve. I spent a total of 7 hrs trying to get this sorted - not acceptable!",1
"Difficult to ""score"" my experience as the individual who dealt with my query was good, BUT the Vodafone terms and conditions not so good. My contract expired a couple of months ago and I confess I was late in getting new one sorted. As a result I overpaid by 2 months. Not a huge sum, only £28, but they do not refund any overpayments until you cancel the contract. I am happy with the network coverage so wanted to stay and negotiated a sim only deal. Vodafone will hang onto my £28 until I leave them and if I don't, I guess they will keep it? I wonder how many £m's of overpayments they are keeping??",1
I have been a broadband and mobile phone customer for 4 years. Received email clearly showing offer you might like and all information of Broadband upgrade to Vodafone ProII. I clicked the link and followed the instructions. Later I received the confirmation email which surprised me as it's just a renewal of my original Fiber 2 plan at a higher price and discount. I think that email and that way of promotion lacked the transparency and honesty. You don't mislead your customers this way and it would be better to send clear information saying the renewal of your same plan is that. I spoke with the customers service and the acknowledge it but can't do much. They advised to go to the store they might help ?!,1
"Seven+ years with Vodafone and I think I need to move providers ...........I've reached out to fix an issue with logging into MyVodafone app 5 times and not one agent has the technical knowledge to help.Once you [eventually] reach a human they log a ticket with their own backroom staff to reset account which is meant to happen in 2/3 business days but is just lost. No follow up on their behalf. They pass the buck of responsibility from team to team and your left in queues whilst they decide who's responsibility it is to fix the issue.TOBi is the most frustrating and glitchy chatbot everService is getting very expensive again too, annual CPI increases have me looking to giffgaff and lebara for exact same services",1
"Chris the manager was brilliant couldnt fault him at all. However, he was let down by the horrific computer software. For a simple upgrade it took nearly 3 hours. 3 hours i wont be getting back. 3 hours sat in a shop on god awful chairs and no toilets. Couldnt leave or else i would have lost where we were upto. Good staff typically let down by higher management.",1
"Checked before I came to Fort William for signal which said good outdoors, utter rubbish as I haven't had a signal since we arrived. I'm having to use the wife's hot spot on EE . Worst thing I have ever done is to join Vodafone again, so behind the curve with speed and signal. Stay well clear as even at home in the North East it's only average. Home broadband is C#&p as well.",1
"Vodafone customer for 30 years, went to Halifax store today to upgrade / renew.Eventually found a phone / data combo but I have a separate Vodafone data plan they couldn’t cancel in store so I needed to call 191.I now understand why the store wanted me to do this later, but not wanting to sign a new package until I knew the redundant one was definitely cancelled I called 191 while in store.The 191 handler then offered to beat the in-store deal I was offered by 10%, ~£100. As the store didn’t actually have the phone in stock it made no sense not to take up his offer to get the same thing at the same time but for less.I was then asked to leave the Vodafone store… leaving me and my 10 year old son in the cold outside the Vodafone store to have a 15 minute call with the Vodafone call centre to complete my new three year commitment to Vodafone.Is it just me that sees something wrong in the overall Vodafone model there??Also worth noting that during the call the handler believed the shop logged in and cancelled my order on the system while he was completing it, putting us back to square one again and wasting another 5 minutes - but I have no way of knowing if that’s true. If it is it crossed a spiteful line though.I can sort of understand the shop not being happy… but Vodafone’s pricing and distribution model isn’t my fault.I’ll likely be very happy with the phone, I’m ok with the plan charges and my son has a great story to tell at primary school about being kicked out of the store…. The guy on 191 was great too as an individual, but none of this saga is a ringing endorsement for Vodafone overall.",1
"I switched provider after 1 year with Vodafone because they just don't offer good value for money. There are a lot better deals for somebody like me who is just not a heavy data user. Their network was reliable and coverage was always good.However, when trying to renew my deal, the staff at various shops in London just showed very little interest in offering anything competitive, and weren't particularly helpful even though I was an existing customer.",1
"Bought a Vodafone Curve for the dog, it is pretty poor.  If it cannot find a GPS signal it reverts to a random location miles away which looks like someone else's tracker.  The app logs you out and you need to go through getting an SMS, AND an email, THEN ALSO putting in your password, to log back in.  I also cannot get it to show a map history, which is what I bought it for.  Overall it is not very well designed and not recommended.",1
Following a recent 14 day visit to US I found that I had incurred a daily charge for usage when in fact I only made a network call on one day. I queried this with the Taunton branch and it was explained that I needed to be in airplane mode otherwise my phone connecting to a mast would incur a charge?? They advised speaking to Vodafone direct which I did and they said that I should have set my phone to zero charges not airplane mode?? Neither piece of advice appears anywhere on their website as far as I could find. Vodafone are now investigating to verify what I have explained and will therefore I hope refund the amounts charged.,1
Fiber internet is excellent but. Customer service & online access to your account is demand of generation. Their customer service & mobile App is just a glitch. They call it security feature but now a day bank apps work with 1 click then why not vodafone app.,1
"The employees, Maria and Hula, were very kind and helpful. They answered our questions and we successfully managed to get the plan and phone we wanted.However, the service in general was very slow. They said it’s because of the computers loading slowly. If that can be addressed on a company level, that would be great. The whole process took 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete, which is way too long.It would objectively take less time to get a mortgage on a house.",1
Broadband seems to be ok been online with Vodafone since December last year very few outages BUT the Vodafone router is absolutely rubbish we had to buy an extender to reach all our house our previous Talktalk router was fine.Edit 17/4/23 No point in me reaching out as you put it you won't do anything about it I have tried all I was told I would have to upgrade which I don't have the money to do,1
"Initially, this ""WiFi"" enabled system was ribbish, sold as 100 mbps with a guaranteed 50 but struggled to exceed mid 30s at the router and much less throughout the house, excused by ""we dont guarantee WiFi speed"". Constant readings sent to senior CS forwarded to the tech dept resulted, although it took 14 days, a techie working with me to test  everything piece by piece. The results of reseting the router took some hours to work but we then had the speeds expected of this sytsem. SO - dont wright off the system as I did until you've hounded senior CS into getting a techie on the job. Had I settled for the first line of CS / support getting this sorted would not have happened.",1
"I would give them 5 stars if they offered free roaming within Europe. Their competitors offer free roaming with pay as you go bundles purchased, but not Vodafone. I was with them for few years because of great coverage and services, and sadly I decided to leave, after they had stopped offering free roaming. What a shame. They are the best choice if you do not need roaming.",1
The chat online and telephone calls are always a myth. Keep getting transferred to different colleagues as not one person can deal with all queries meaning I am spending hours on each time they put me on hold.,1
"Even out of contract it'll force you to pay for the full final month of connection.""Your 30 day disconnection notice will start from today, 14/08/2023.The number you are disconnecting is xxxYou have a fee of £0.00 to pay left which will come out on your normal billing date in the next 30 days.Your disconnection will be completed 30 days from today, 13/09/2023.

"It’s fine unless there’s an issue. They took 2 extra direct debit payments in April, yet to pay them back, cheaper offers for the same deal out there as they’ve decided to cancel my discount I had on, tried charging me £50 when a deal for new customers is £35. Their chat system closes itself when you leave the page on your phone, and their phone system sounds like it’s hanging up on you when you try to get through to them. They don’t care about your loyalty. 12 years I’ve paid them to be my carrier. Bit frustrating that the best they could do was the same deal as everyone else! And there are cheaper out there!Positives is if there isn’t a problem you’re fine, never bad signal or loss of data, always updating towers.",1
"Service is great.  Slow, but great.  Speed of service has nothing to do with employees;  it’s the system they use.  My only issue is gettin an appointment.  You can’t make one on the UK Vodafone number as they don’t have the capability.  You can’t just walk in and get helped because you have to be in the system for them to do so.  The number provided for the store by Vodafone customer service is out of service.  There is no published number for this store and it’s the only one within 90 miles of me.  So, I have to make a an hour and a half round trip just to make an appointment and then do it again once again for my scheduled appointment.  It’s almost like this tech company need to to hire a tech firm to sort out their issues.",1
"I organised the contract for broadband to start on 5th July and received the router a few days before. I contacted customer support on the 5th to check whether an engineer was coming to fit a new master socket since mine doesn't have a microfilter built in. I come to find out that the order failed for some ""technical reasons"" (despite receiving order confirmation emails, the router, setting up the direct debit etc). The contract now starts next week however the activation is simply a virtual button so I struggle to see what part of that has to wait until then. :(",1
"The internet is generally okay, nothing spectacular, but there are 2 main sticking points with them.1. Increasing the price before the contract is even half way through!!2. part of their introductory offer (to help ""soften the blow"" of increased prices AND shove the offer down customers' throats) they are in partnership with Giftcloud.Giftcloud? More like Griefcloud! This company makes promises but delivers nothing but disappointment and frustration. After completing a purchase expecting a gift voucher, all I got was radio silence. Their customer service? Non-existent. It's clear they thrive on deceiving customers and couldn't care less about fulfilling their promises.Calling Giftcloud a scam is too kind; they're outright thieves. They've wasted my time, caused inconvenience, and have the audacity to ignore my attempts to contact them. I demand compensation for their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. Avoid Giftcloud like the plague if you value your sanity and hard-earned money. They're not worth the headache. - I cant believe Vodafone would even consider partnering up with them!!",1
"The service today was excellent first and foremost but the store itself was FREEZING and I was there - as many people are - for over 20 minutes which was essential as i needed my phone sorting but very difficult to manage! It seems ludicrous that the doors can't be closed in baltic weather conditions, the staff must be absolutely freezing all day.",1

"Absolutely unbelievable bad service. My husband took out a new contract with a new phone over two weeks ago. They told him as a reward he would get a payment of £150. He had to go back to collect his phone four days later. Trip one contract, trip two collect phone. Trip three to follow up on reward payment told we needed the receipt. Trip four to take receipt in,  only to be told it will be another 45 days before this is available. We have both had contracts with Vodafone for 5 years. Renewed the first one and about to renew the second one. Its costing more than the reward in travel and inconvenience and now we still have to wait. Would you like for us to pay in 45 days. I bet ""no"".",1
The broadband speed has not improved so far despite being a customer for 8 years… But the prices are steadily going up every year! The company has not invested to improve the broadband!,1
"Although my contract is with Vodafone,  I’ve posted this review for them (3 stars) and 2 stars for City Fibre.During the 13 months as a customer of City Fibre with Vodafone providing the broadband, there have been 2 periods of total loss of service (outages). Recent outage for 4 full days; previously 2 days.Regarding the latter 4 days loss of service:Negatives• Having a family member dependent on broadband for homeworking has meant extra costs, travel elsewhere, and a lot of stress and frustration.• 4 days to fix the problem seems excessive.• Very difficult to get a direct answer regarding the exact cause of the problem – no direct communication with City Fibre permitted.  I was informed by Vodafone that the line was damaged and needed replacing. Knowing the cause [of the damage] is important in assessing if this might be a recurring event.• Vodafone has limitations on Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme, i.e. no payments for the first 48 hours of loss of service.• Vodafone appear overly reliant on City Fibre with little influence regarding obtaining detailed communication, such as in this situation.• City Fibre’s website claims of a reliable and consistent service, is debatable. It is a subjective experience, and mine has been mixed; it has been made worse by no clear explanation of the cause of the disruption.Positives:• Vodafone did what it could in terms of communication, which was generally good and respectful, but ultimately they were reliant on information from City Fibre.• Vodafone has signed up to Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme.• When the broadband is running, it is generally working well.It seems to me some things happen that are outside anybody’s control, as may be the case in these outages. This doesn’t help in the frustration and disruption caused to those that rely on the service. However, a quicker fix of the problem and some clearer communication would certainly have helped.",1
"Although I like Vodafone, I was VERY disappointed that it charged me a £5 late fee when I had no warning from them that the DDEB had been reversed. Literally had no idea. A nice email would have sufficed with a warning but nothing.",1
"Vodafone, great deals but terrible service on resolving an account sync issue with the app and broadband quality.I had a device plan with the Vodafone for phone and broadband. unfortunately due to no-fault of my own the app wouldn’t work with my log in details.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was salvina I have probably spelt that wrongI called multiple times but spoke to a different person every time over a 2 week period.After spending the best part of 2 hours on the phoneThey were still unable to sort out my app issues with my account.Before I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to get the issue resolved. I’m not sure if she was aware of the app issues from previous customers?The other issue was to do with the intermittent signal of the broadband cutting in and out. This was detrimental to my working day at home. It would cut out on Microsoft teams around 4/5 times a day! Very frustrating!The outcome from all this was that I ended up switching both phone device and broadband to EE.This wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome and overall experience would be a lie hence the move.",1
I renewed my contract over six months ago and still can't see my usage or bills. Customer Service is a waste of time and get ghosted by their engineers email address. The app is not fit for purpose either!,1
Why is it impossible to log into Vodafone. Impossible to check speed of broadband or anything else.Well. Have tried four times to login with new passwords Vodafone has just texted. NONE OF THEM WORK! Surprise SURPRISE!,1
"I considered leaving Vodafone today, after several years.  They just increased my monthly fee by 25%.  I spent an hour and a half online with their Customer support team.They offered me Fibre 2 for £25 a month. If I was a new customer I would get it for £20.63 a month. Vodafone are poor to existing customers. It really makes you want to leave.",1
"5 Star for the actual service1 star for every time I try to access the app out of hours it's offline or unavailable. I maybe use the app once a month, and every time its when I need something urgently. How can such a large company not have a clustered enviropment so it's always up.",1
"I ordered a product from Vodafone on Saturday, choosing the ""collect from store"" option, as it promised I could collect it the next day. By Sunday, it wasn’t ready, nor on Monday. I contacted live chat on Tuesday and the first agent said the order had arrived at the store on Monday at 2:58 pm, but I hadn’t received any notification. I asked if I could pick it up, only to be told I had to wait for a notification.When I questioned this, I was passed to another agent who contradicted the first, claiming the order hadn’t arrived but was ""dispatched."" They couldn’t explain why their colleague said it was there, just kept repeating that I had to wait another 48 hours! This would be Thursday when it was originally promised for Sunday. They’ve taken my money, and no one can give a straight answer as to why it wasn't ready on time, or when it will be. All I get is ""wait 48 hours."" I needed it urgently, and the only reason I chose Vodafone was because they promised next-day collection. Absolutely awful service!Checking on the website for a fresh order (exactly the same phone) it says collect today. So if a fresh order for the same phone can be collected today then why can't I collect my order that I placed pm Saturday, now?Update: While the online support was terrible and gave me the runaround, I went into the store, and the staff were excellent. They sorted everything out quickly and efficiently. If only the online service was as good as the in-store experience!",1
"I upgraded to full fibre a couple of months ago, it was a great mistake!! The connection is unreliable, my signal is constantly dropping of. The very reason to upgrade was to have a strong connection while I work from home. My meetings constantly cut out, the signal strength cannot take a simple Teams screen sharing. There is also no way of getting support: i am directed back to signal check test by all sorts of bot chats where i am told that everything is fine with my service. Then when i go through the suggested steps proving that the problem is still outstanding the chat button conveniently does not work. There is no email address and the phone line is so busy that i cannot wait out while i also try working (on 4G!! as I have no reliable home broadband). I am locked in a 24 months contract from which I desperately want to get out of.EDIT: I managed to speak with CS, and they were very helpful so I am changing my rating. Only to 3 because I don't know yet if my drop outs will persist.",1

"New broadband connection installed by cityfibre (glasgow) on behalf of vodaphone, on 1st March 2024. It took 4 days to activate my account, and did not work for further 10 days. After 2 further fault finding visits by city fibre engineers to identify & fix the problem - it was faulty cable coming into the house - there are not many things that can go wrong so is it really difficult to identify and fix a fault ?. I also had at least 3 calls from vodaphone offshore rebooting my router and connection box in the house. I was told by vodaphone, the delayed activation and loss of service, I would automatically receive compensation, which i did not.I chased 2 months later and having got through to vodaphone support in India who were clueless and then to vodaphone in Egypt, I got someone to raise  tickets for delayed activation (4 days) and loss of service (10 days). I received the compensation for the delayed activation but not the delayed service , £70+ is still outstanding. To be fair, all working fine since it was fixed.",1
"I should probably do 2 reviews for this.  Vodafone would score 1 star but Harvey, the assistant manager in Winchester would score 5 stars.I have had a billing problem with Vodafone and despite hours trying to speak to 191 - when I eventually get through, they either can't help and just cut me off or promise to cal back and don't - I got absolutely nowhere.  I went into Vodafone in Winchester where the manager Alexei tried to help.  He discovered problems with the set up of my account going back years, spoke to Vodafone who again promised to get back within a week.  They didn't and next thing I'm receiving threatening messages saying my line will be disconnected and my number removed.I again went into Winchester Vodafone and was lucky enough to be seen by Harvey.  The first person who sat there calmly saying I will sort this for you.  Not only is he a whizz on the system, keeping on and on at it trying to find a solution, but is utterly charming with it.Harvey is now on the case checking everything is sorted and has promised to phone back with an update.  Vodafone - do everything you can to keep Harvey.  If it wasn't for him I would now be transferring our 5 numbers with you after being with you for over 25 years.  Thank you Harvey!",1

My device plan hasn’t been paid because Vodafone havnt been taking any payments they kept telling me it’s because of my bank and my bank told me it’s Vodafone that keeps rejecting it. I have been trying to get this sorted since September and they wouldn’t help me and now they have given me to the debt collectors agency. I talked to Adele today and she wasn’t really helping either only said either I pay full amount or wait for the debt collectors to contact me. All I want is to set up a direct debit but they won’t allow it which just doesn’t make sense. I even offered to pay more than I’m meant to today and they wouldn’t let me. Before also someone was meant to contact me and they didn’t and when I talked to debt collectors they told me that the account is with Vodafone. It’s a big mess! Vodafone do not know what they are saying and I am really leaning to switch providers after this bill is paid because Vodafone are not helpful and I keep having problems with them . I have been a customers for over 10 years and they won’t even try helping me.,1
Voicemail gets locked you if you enter wrong pin one time. I've only tried from abroad so may work differently from UK. You then need to call a number where nobody's picking up the phone. So it's impossible to get access to voicemail...,1
"Update on my experience on 11th September.I was so disappointed in the lack of interest in my not receiving calls/no network inside my house, I called again to make a complaint.  I was put through to a gentleman called Abdul.  He listened, spoke with a manager and asked that I hold on while tests were being run.  He said if the call was terminated, he would call back.  It was, and he did.  He asked me to turn off my internet and try to make calls from different areas in my house and he would call back in 1 hour to see how I got on.  I cannot believe it worked.  Every room I made a call to my landline and I had no problems.  I started again, this time with my internet on, and after a little blip in one area of the house, the rest worked.  Abdul called back and advised he would call again on the 12th to check everything was still ok.  Really pleased it worked, so if anyone has a problem, maybe just go straight to complaints.  Everything is still ok, but he never called back on 12th.  If he had it would have been a 5 star review.",1

"Great, Vodafone is starting to turn off their 3g signal. What chance do most people have as their 4&5g is garbageMay as well go back to 2 tin cans and a piece of string if you are stuck on this network. Worst decision I ever made to come to this 3rd world company.Broadband is poor as well.I appreciate I get unlimited data but the speed is dire, most of the time it takes 30 second's to load a news page.Used to be on EE which was great and never had any issues, with Vodafone there is 4 dead spots on my way home from work along the A19 which sometimes causes me to reboot my phone to reconnect to 5hr network. to be honest it may also be partially due to the dire Pixel 6 phone as well. Either way I'm trying to get out of both contracts asap.",1
Can’t say I’m overly impressed after having very slow Internet for over five days their response is not adequate.,1
I bought a phone from Vodafone shop in Doncaster a week ago and paid £49 for the phone but I was walking out and on the stand it was priced at £39 does Vodafone no it's against the consumer rights law to over charges I would go back to the shop but the manager doesn't have any powers to refund I would send a letter but they never respond I sent a letter to the CEO 2 weeks ago about something else I'm still waiting for a response so I will just do a charge back to my card so please contact me Vodafone and it was missing the ear plugs for the phone and the charger you can message me here I have also texted your retail operation's manager Rebecca hessey on her mobile number,1
"I had ordered a mobile hotspot over the phone - took three hours and two days to get it all confirmed. My order tracker said I'd receive it the next day but I didn't and the day after, it said my order has been cancelled (!?) no alerts - i went to check my tracking updates! COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED BY DPD - POOR SERVICE FOR SURE AND THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO CONTACT THEM AT ALL!I called back Vodafone and the person told me they can't tell me why it was cancelled but said it happened at 4am ?!? I asked for a click and collect instead of delivery and they said they couldn't do that for me and asked me to replace my order and wait for 3 more days.I lost hope but I called back an hour later and got to speak with Sharu, who went through all my details with me calmly and was very empathetic all throughout the call. He was able to look into click and collect for me and had me stay on the phone for about 15 mins and got my order placed and my device ready for collection.",1
Very poor signal for calls and data in pevensey bay for me inside and out. I have spoken to their people many times and been advised to to the same things to try and rectify over and over again. I now manage to make calls over WiFi(indoors) but struggle to get two bars. I even boight a second phone to check mine was ok and had the same issue. Would not recommend them in this area. Also you would think they would keep a record of previous calls and advice so you don't have to go over the same ground every single time. Also I Don not have any media accounts so cannot conduct responses that way. PS I used my phone in London over weekend and it worked fine.,1
I was with vodafone for years.Most of the network providers monthly contract included free EU roaming. But vodafone charged £2.25 a day on top of monthly charges.Also price increases twice within a year.,1
"I’ve had a Vodafone contract for well over 10 years, probably close to 15 years. For the vast majority of time it’s been as any network should be in terms of network coverage. At any contract upgrade time I’ve always felt somewhat valued and had some discounts added for a new phone or if going on to a sim only plan temporarily I found it was a good deal. However this time I was offered a really poor sim only deal, no offers of discounts and no movement in price. I told the lady on the phone that I can see deals half the price online on Vodafone networks, why can’t you do the same? The answer was it was a 3rd party contract, now if I can get a better deal by going to a 3rd party why an earth would I want to go direct to Vodafone. Absolutely ridiculous! Since that last conversation and have my PAC code sent I have had no contact from customer retentions which means my 10-15 years of business had no value or the Vodafone don’t care about existing customers and are happy for them to leave. So after many, many years of using Vodafone I have switched to 3 network. I gave 3 stars as the network coverage is decent, customer services is usually good to deal with but this last interaction was enough for me to give 1 star but felt that it wouldn’t be a clear picture of the last 10+ years.",1
I spoke today with jay from customer office ! I lost a lot of time explaining what I want but the idi run away and not come back. I dont understand why Vodafone paying idio like him ! I just need a new contract. Just to give money to Vodafone !,1
"Signed up for fibre broadband and it wan't made clear how much disruption/ ugly wiring and ugly boxes would be involved outside and inside the house- plus I need to get a extra socket sited ( at my expense) so router and fibre box can both be plugged in.They have to be next to each other unless the householder organises and installs their own longer ethernet cable between the two.   None of this was explained by Vodaphone. City Fibre who did the installation were informative and helpful but pressure was applied by comments like "" copper lines are being phased out so it will have to be done at some time"". Ultimately I now have an unsightly brown box on the outside of the house  and an ugly set up on the wall inside with a large  freestanding white router in a situation that is not what I wanted but the alternative was running cables along the hall round 2 doors, across the stairs,through a doorway, along a wall, and round another door. I will also need to plug the landline phone into the new router which is not where I want my phone. Plus have just realised phone has a plug as it has an answer machine is I can't actually use it any more Didn't think of that one and no one explained it in advance. Very dissatisfied with outcome of switching to full fibre.PS trying to get through on phone is a nightmare- clearly set up to prevent every obstacle to speaking to a human being, including demanding aPIN which I have not been given",1
"Had rollercoaster rides when 7 days remaining in contract to finish. Wanted to retain the spending in control. Offer was to downgrade the package. Agreed and someone made it happen. Then it was cancelled and i was out of old contract by the time. Everytime i talk to them they pit new order and it remain open ... never activated and one brilliant advisor has just sorted it and my activation of new plan is now planned after x'mas.I have got nothing but anxiety and worry for piling up current bills and future bill was going to be double than what it could be. Also they have added unusual charge of ""purchase fees"" worth £16  in my next bill. Which was never been mentioned by any one, even though i mention to advisors. Billing related complaint has been raised but they never gave me answer about that fees and some explanation of future bill can be only found when it is generated.So i have no choice to wait till then and raise it again if not removed from bill. Average time of call with them was never been less than 90 minutes which do not uphold Vodafone reputation i have been praising for.Hope as promised new contract takes place. Like other providers are having multiple stars from trustpilot, Vodafone should do all for their loyal customers. I felt like i was and i am badly letdown by Vodafone till now.",1

I have just jumped ship with my mobile phone package to Vodafone from O2 after too many years to mention the mobile service is fantastic I sometimes even get 5G whereas I was lucky to even get 4G with O2.Now for the BUT I swapped over from BT WiFi and phone on the 17th  I’ve now been in the garden a few times and where I picked up broadband with BT in the garden? The signal had dropped out completely on Vodafone’s new 6E router. We also tried it within the property to find the broadband drops out in the bedroom furthest away. We had signal throughout the property and the hub is in exactly the same place as the BT 6 hub was. I called Vodafone on Tuesday and spoke with a lovely lady who was going to send out one booster to begin with too see how we got on with just one. She had to put us on hold but came back and said our router was the new 6E and the booster she was going to get sent out would not be compatible. But she said that the broadband guys said I would have to upgrade my package. I can’t understand why a more advanced router needs a booster in comparison to the BT router and also I cannot understand that one minute they was going to send out a booster then the next NO I would have to pay more a month or still had time to return to BT. Being unable to walk and in a wheelchair and on Oxygen since contracting COVID I cannot go through having to rely on people to set up everything for me I find that embarrassing.,1
"Would you think buying an inexpensive pay-as-you-go phone would take 10 hours!?  I certainly didn’t think so, until I had to interact with Vodaphone.First, I stopped by the store looking to purchase a certain phone SEVEN times.  Each time, the phone was out of stock.  Each time, I got different information about what the procedure was and what information I would need.  What the sales people I saw FORGOT to mention was that I could just go online and get one!  They incorrectly said activation could only be done in store.  Instead, they kept on telling me to come back in the next day, and the next, and the next.  I came back, waited in line, left, came back, repeat.  Seven times.  On visit seven, one man finally told me I could just buy the phone online.  By that time, I needed the phone the next morning.  (I had spent over a week at this already).  Then, they gave me the wrong information about the online purchase options.  I ended up speaking with someone via chat, and indeed, the purchase options I had been asking about were not possible online given my now urgent timeline.  So, back to the store, for a 30 minute wait at 10am all for a £30 back up phone!  What an unpleasant experience.",1
"The Openreach engineer arrived & got the fiber optic broadband line working, but no Internet. He said he suspected the router wasn't compatible & told me they won't return unless Vodafone issue a new one. I call Vodafone (great this non-joined-up service) and am refused a new router. Call center guy in India tries to ridicule the Openreach guy's findings, before moving on to patronise me and my 'confusion' with the tech (I hold advanced degrees & a Doctorate in Computer Science). Finally, told activation can take up 'til midnight to happen. Midnight arrives, sails by, nothing is activated. My landline phone doesn't work anymore either. The Openreach guy suspects the Vodafone router, but at this point I'm pretty sure it's Vodafone themselves who haven't got off their backsides to activate it. So much stress. They didn't even send the cable they were supposed to send to connect the Openreach box to my router (I had to buy one from a neighbour). Nor did they send the adaptor for my landline, so I'm cut off.I call Vodafone again the next day and speak to 'Marion', who is surely Vodafone's Star helpline person! She activated the line during our (long) call. She was helpful, knowledgeable, easy to talk to and a pleasure of a human being to deal with. She got everything working. Then she put in an order for the missing phone adaptor. Just perfect.It's 5 stars for Marion but 1 star for the company, so I'm averaging it out to 3 stars, because of the stress and because it was left up to me to chase this up with multiple long phone calls, rather than receiving a ready and working service, or I'd still be cut off now.",1
Chloe was great. Very friendly and personable. However finding opening hours or contacting the store is impossible.,1

"Vodafone currently supply our home broadband - I believe many of the issues with broadband stem from BT OpenReach one way or another, but Vodafone is a big enough company in it's own right to take some responsibility/not be bullied too much.Set up was a bit of a shambles - told the line needed installing even though the new-build house already had an active fibre connection with lights on(!) Waited an extra month or so just for a guy from OpenReach to come in and say 'yup that's fine' and leave.Connection is ok, has been a little flaky sometimes but generally fine for daily work and evening media streaming. On the occasion it drops though, router can take a very long time to regain a lost connection. Router is mediocre and app control is terrible... if you ever manage to set it up to your phone it chucks you out permanently at some point, and to reconnect the app you need to reset the router completely (even that didn't always work). Gave up on it.Again - OpenReach and many customer-facing telecom suppliers are doing it, but mid-contract, (over) inflationary rises in price is a dodgy practice in my eyes, however many companies there are that do it. If I sign up to a £30, 24 month contract I should be paying £30 in month 23, not ~£40. Else don't call it a contract - let customers leave whenever you change the terms (price).In all, absolutely no reason to stay at end of contract so will look to ditch and switch - as many services force you to nowadays - unless you want to sit paying more than you need to for being loyal/'lazy'.",1
"Popped in to Vodafone MerryHill to get some information on switching networks. Gup was brilliant and helped me choose the best contract for me, and options to transfer the family. Transfer happened today with no issues and already enjoying better coverage.Heading back soon to transfer the rest of my contracts now as it was so easy.Thanks Gup and the Vodafone Team.Updated 23rd April 2024Further to my initial positive review, I have had some issues with the transfer of the other numbers. Firstly, Vodafone have a restriction on all new customers to 2 connections to the contract. I have been advise by the credit team this is standard and you need three complete months billed so my initial discussion to move over 4 contracts would never have gone through. Which brings me on to the second issue, all of this is done by the credit team and rather than simply advising on the restriction, all communication’s suggest it’s a credit issue….. This stressed me out massively for 48 hours thinking there was something wrong with my credit score (which there wasn’t) until I finally got an answer, but this was only on the back of a “credit appeal” where the Vodafone rep advise on the 2 line limit…Vodafone really need to firstly advise on the 2 line limit, and then secondly be clear that it’s not a credit issue. For reference my credit score was 930 out of 1000 so the 2 line limit (sim only too) was clearly not related to my score….Be mindful if you have multiple contracts you are looking to switch…..",1

"I've been with voda for many years . Over that time I've varied my plan according to business and social needs and its worked well. Staff you contact are usually very helpful and their customer service system works well. Travelling the world their data and telephony connections were usually reliable and high quality.However when it comes to the hard core subject of cash they let themselves down very badly in several areas .Firstly they were very fast to remove automatic covered  roaming post brexit but even before that they were clamping down and becoming inflexible. They introduced a system whereby if you were out of the uk got a certain time your  roaming cost you extra even on an inclusive plan. It was a complicated calculation that they got wrong and started charging me a month early and would not back down for quite some time and did so just before the regulator was about to step in.We then move onto in plan price rises . Fair enough up the cost by the RPI , though it is a bit of a money gtab, but then to add a further 3 point something percent on for ""network investment"" ?? Surely ongoing investment is par to operating and development strategy and accommodated within the overall business plan ?Someone somewhere is being greedy and then shoots themselves in the foot by posting massive profits .To put all of that in context I have an EU plan too . Unlimited texts and sms . 8gb of data ( chosen by me) with EU and UK roaming . All for €9.99 with excellent service. Voda can't or won't  come anywhere near that.Update : whilst voda prices are on the up again my provider has put me on unlimited everything for the equivalent of Uk £10, still with roamimg. Voda are poor value.Goodbye voda.",1
"Vodafone are looking like they are doing all they can to counter what is presently taking place on the ground in the personal telecoms and media industry to all of their customers.I say this from the position of being a victim to the Three iPhone scam and I now realize that once they have scammed you that's when you look for somewhere to run to in my case it's Vodafone.No matter what the companies using the existing infrastructure try to do the engineers are wagging the dog now.When they come to switch you up you expect them to leave you with the same switches and cable as you always had but that's not what happens as far as I can tell they change your switch to a single slower Openreach Master Socket 5C not 5gz, face plate and there is no filter in the Vodafone Router box it's been removed in transit.So now I want to know where are my extra pairs now that I'm reduced to a single socket switch and one of my three pairs in the cable, with no filter, I'm setup without my knowledge or permission for sharing something I suggest you never doI'm paying extra for the privacy and the speed and to my way of thinking I'm getting neither the entire set up is to reduce speed to 3gz not 4 or 5gz.I want my speed back or come and remove your switches and replace my dual Openreach switch that was originally there.Who is personally monitoring our network and slowing us down.More to the point, why are we being monitored and by whom.Paranoid, you better be, if you're not a little skeptical in the UK these days then you're in a far worse position than I.",1

"**Customer Review:**I have been a witness to a very unruly and rude gentleman by name David George who is wasting everyone’s time and picking on the staff unnecessary and exhibits rude behavior and creates disturbances, demonstrating a lack of interest in Vodafone's services. This individual has a pattern of targeting staff members, leading to an uncomfortable and disruptive environment. Such customers should be blacklisted and never allowed to step in the store.",1
Where to start. Communication is absolutely terrible whenever I've faced any issues.My latest one being that I called and asked if the contract could be put in my own name (it's in my ex husbands but it's my phone/internet service) He is using it as a form of control and manipulation and I told them that. I begged them to swap it over and they told me they can't help me.I then asked if it could go into my mums name who is already a Vodafone customer. Bizarrely they said this was fine. I had to call my mum and tell her to call them and do the same with my ex. I had to act as this go between multiple times. It took 3 days of calls to finally get to a place where they said it would be done then we heard nothing.I called them after 3 days to be told the information had been lost and we'd have to go through it all again. My ex then refused.I had to flee my ex for domestic violence so for him to have this last piece of control over me is awful. Every time we have a row he says he'll cut my phone/Internet off.Yet Vodafone won't help me. I'm trapped until Aug next year.I certainly won't be going with this company again once the contract ends.,1
"Review for broadband set up. Switched from BT, only because of cost. Set up was great and can’t fault CityFibre at all, respectful, quick, clean installation and the supply is all good, I have no disappointment with regards to any of this. However when taking out the contract online I was informed that I do not need to do anything with regards to cancellation of my current provider, BT, and that Vodafone will inform them directly. After all was set up I contacted BT to inform them I would be cancelling my DD payments and was told they they were not informed. After a lengthy call to Vodafone I now have to take myself to one of their shop once I have proof of last payment to BT and the email showing where it says I didn’t need to do anything (this of course being an automatically generated email and likely to be what they send out all the time) and once showing them this they will refund me what I have paid to BT due to Vodafone not cancelling on my behalf. Being self employed and working six days a week I probably won’t have time to do this so I’m very disappointed by this situation. Such a shame for a simple task that I was informed they would do, which I could have as easily done had they just said to call BT and cancel I’m now going to be out of pocket….. A very disappointing start ☹️☹️☹️",1
"Had to wait quite a while to be seen (not staffs fault just busy and three staff on)When serverd Tom was very good,pleasent and got me a good deal.I wanted to cancel my tablet I no longer use but had to do it online would of been better to be able to do it in the shop. Again not the fault of the staff in the shop.",1
"My third time on here about this company. I tried to communicate with the Social Media Team through my partners FB Messenger account about my previously reviewed dismal experience. After numerous to and fros was I informed that (a) because I'm not on my own FB/Twitter and (b) I don't have a Vodafone sim card (I was supposed to get one for the back up dongle with both the first and second router they sent but never did), nor a Vodafone mobile number, they couldn't verify my account. Then I got this via Trustpilot:Hi Howard,After reading your previous review, I can understand your frustration. It's not good to hear the experience you're having.We do need to take your account details securely, so that we can then help further.Please get in touch with our WiFi Xperts on 08080 034 515. We've also a really useful help center that will help to run live tests on your line here: (link not permitted in reviews)Thanks,Vodafone Social Media TeamI didn't have that number so called and luckily a Customer Service agent named Huda (I asked her to spell it) dealt with the whole thing in about 40 minutes. Apparently the original agent was wrong and I can revert to my original package at the original price. It will take up to 24 hours and all will be sorted.The 3 Stars are for the efforts of Huda, a very friendly, polite and sympathetic lady who gave the impression she really wanted to help. I just hope she's supported by the upgrade team (she said they're sorting it out).So the blood pressure medication will stay in the cupboard for the time being. Although I still have no sim in my backup dongle.Watch this space !",1

"Called Vodaphone Customer Service this afternoon, to give 30 days notice of my wish to cancel my Home Broadband Account (moving home and will need to utilise another provider).  Customer Service could not action my request as they are undergoing ""technical"" updates, so none of their systems are working apparently!  Have been instructed to phone back in 7 days, where upon my 30 day notice will start (so I am paying for an extra 1 weeks service that I do not want)  This cannot be fair???  Welcome Vodaphone's response to this :-                                                           Visited a branch (Northallerton) to sort and the team where great, pointing me in the right direction and finally managed to speak to a human in the Retentions team today, who was really efficient and has sorted out my issue:- Thank You.

"Unfortunately I have to knock two stars off .I entered the shop to ask information about sim packets, while my son was checking the new iphone. The information given was very  useful and detailed.When I was about to go my minor mentioned me he took photos of himself, and was trying to erase them. Unfortunately it was not possible as the delete button on the iphone's screen was covered by the metallic frame that holds the phone in place. We tried to push it nevertheless but we weren't that successful. I politely asked a member of staff to help saying that my son took photos, could we please erase them. He tried to push  the delete button also unsuccessfully, due to the metallic frame blocking access. What I found very annoying is that instead of him removing the metallic frame and deleting the photos, he said to me in an apathetic way (at least in my understanding)  that I myself have  to push the delete button eitherway to delete the photos. This is of course understandable, but what about the metallic frame blocking the access to the delete button?? In conclusion we managed to delete the photos by squeezing our fingers in between the phone's screen and the protective metallic frame that holds the phone. Of course mostly my son as he had smaller fingers, and yes it was painful.I understand that I should probably supervise my son more, but such reaction I didn't expect. It makes me feel concerned about how the specific shop or the specific member of staff deals with GDPR issued such as this.So if you visit the specific shop and try the phones' front camera making selfie, make sure that you are ok to leave your photo stored in that device, cause it will be unlikely for you to delete it, at least without hurting yourselves...",1

"When I ordered the board band service I requested that the old phone number to be ported. It is vital in my case as my wife suffers from poor health. The phone line was the contact between us and doctors,Hospitals and elderly relatives. I ordered nearly two months in advance giving them ample time to set up as l required. The first time I was aware there was no connection was when a relative tried to contact us. I range customer services who stated it would take up to a10 working days. I told them that this was not acceptable for reasons stated. After 4 days  I rang and asked if calls could be redirected until the switch over was complete. The operator tried to help but could not achieve the results needed. I told the operator I was not happy and asked to speak to his manager. The manager could not even give me the time of day. Not impressed with the level of customer services. I'm beginning to think that I made a mistake in my choice. It brings into question why am I paying for a land line that is useless!!Yesterday 1th I spent what I can only call a merry-go - round for 1 hour Trying to resolve this situation. I was told the number would be ported by 3 pm today. 3pm came and went. Having spoken to 2 operators today,  the earliest they could port was the 21st. The operator  on the last call would have been better using two cans and a length of string. The line kept breaking up so could  ot understand what he was saying. I had to request him to sms the details. For a phone company I find that difficult to get my head round. I did manage to get his number in the sms.  I will be talking to them again, is the way I see it at the moment. PROVE ME WRONG !!!As of today the 22nd the line still has not been ported.it should have been competed  yesterday. We were not told on installation that we had a new number and didn't find out that until the 6th October. I reported to customer services. I was given assurances, promises and told that it would be put right ASAP.  THE COMPANY POLICY SÈEMS TO BE FOB THEM OFF  MAKE PROMISES GIVE ASSURANCES. THE WILL GEY FED UP AND GO AWAY. I informed them that I was not satisfied with their services and told them that I wouldBe sending a letter to Margherita Della Valle in due course. Again I'm still paying for a landline with a number nobody like doctors know.",1
"The broadband service itself is good, we've had two years of reliable internet, the 4G backup does fail quite frequently but fortunately never at the same time as the broadband so we don't end up disconnected. My bug bear has come at renewal time, I was given my upgrade options which were reasonable but I found a better deal elsewhere. When I tried to cancel I was told I could only do so through an online chat or phone.When I spoke to someone on the chat, in spite of providing my account number and personal information as asked, I was asked a further security question (a pin number) which I advised I had never set up so couldn't provide but would happily answer other security questions. After answering several (correctly) I was told I couldn't be spoken to further because I had failed security and I would need to go into store with two forms of ID.I went into store, waited 20 minutes to be spoken to, to be told they can't cancel my contract in store, I would need to phone their customer service from the store so the store assistant could verify my identity which he didn't do before starting to call them. He then asked if I was leaving to go to another provider and advised, I didn't need to cancel at all, the new provider would sort it out so don't waste my time calling.As it is, by the time I'd got this all sorted out, I'd missed the deal from another company so I've ended up upgrading and staying put but what made me laugh is that to upgrade, absolutely no security required whatsoever because I can do it through my account.I fully appreciate this is convenient for customers but it frustrates me that essentially, they are happy to take more money from me without any verification of my identity but when it comes to me stopping payments, no amount of convenience is offered.That's not the sort of customer service that leaves you feeling good about giving them your money.",1
I didn't really like Vodafone. I used it for three months. Tariffs are raised all the time. Bad internet. I wouldn't advise it.,1
"Honest review, I had a very hard time figuring out how to cancel my broadband subscription. When I called the number the automated message referred me to online chat, the online chat referred me back to the number.  I wish Vodafone would make this process more easy, and straightforward.  Once I reached the right team they were very helpful and the process was very quick.",1
"I have taken out a device plan with the Vodafone unfortunately due to no-fault of my own my phone is now faulty. I’ve taken it to the Apple Store but as it’s not under warranty with Apple, they quoted me a price to fix it which I was not prepared to payI have only had the phone for about 4 to 6 weeks before the fault occurred. The phone is in pristine condition. There is no water damage. There is no cracks or scuffs on the device.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was slavina I have probably spelt that wrongI called At 8:12 am on the 7th of October 2024In regards to my faulty phone and I did my displeasure about my service with the chat box online and a previous attempt at calling,After spending 27 minutes on the phoneThey were unable to book my phone for repair because of a system errorBefore I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceI’m kind of 50-50 at the moment because I’ve never been overcharged and I like my contractThe service has room for improvement, but it’s not the worst I’ve receivedI’m going into store on my next day off to book a repair in person as I’m not confident the agent was able to book the repair for meShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to book it. I’m not sure if she was aware of the system error before.Why is my phone being faulty? I don’t have any complaints with Vodafone however whenever anything goes wrong, you’re going to be dissatisfied.Will update my review/post another once I return from visiting the store to see if I can get my phone booked for repairThis wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome would be a lie",1

We are new customer to Vodafone broadband and have basic fibre we are low user but it’s not able to connect with ring cameras properly unless we upgrade our package as low user think this is not acceptable to add extra 10 pounds a month it’s a poorer quality than our old copper network,1

"I have to start by saying that I had been with Virginmedia for 23 years and quite honestly had had enough. They constantly kept putting up their prices. I also did not like being put through to India, where not all of the people spoke good English. I looked on the internet and decided that I would go to Vodafone, also so did a friend of mine. We were being connected the same day. Her's done is 40 minutes mine over 6 weeks. Not really Vodafone fault since the internet said I had City Cable but there's the rub. Whosoever put this cable in didn't leave any markers for connection!! Well as usual all took ages for find the cable then digging a hole and putting in the connection then City Cable arriving for the box and connection. Not the nicest of workmen but perhaps I was just unlucky. The guy in the house very nice and tidy, Now all connected await 12/24 hours for the phone to be connected. Well after 24 hours no phone, back to Vodafone they explained that the number had not been called upon as it was 21 days from closing until recall. Ok so at last I had Broadband then guess what my printer was off line because everything had been closed down for days. Got that sorted and new inks and at last heaven be praised I had everything working after over 6 weeks. This is problem, three different companies working and it does not work. I do not work from home, had I been doing so it would have been a disaster. My friend is very happy she did not have the delay, why you ask? well she had a telegraph pole in her street and I did not. The moral of this story is ""if you are going to go to Vodafone make sure that you have City Cable in your street and that there is a marker."" Otherwise expect a delay. I would like to add that Vodafone have tried to help, they gave me a cash amount back and the villains really seem to be City Cable, Vodafone were slow in the telephone connection but in the end we got there, for me it was a nightmare but not the end as I do not work from home and so when you get someone to dig a hole please let them have the brains not to fill it in without leaving markers.",1

"Like others I have been with Vodafone for years, and have a number of contracts with them, and never missed a payment. My first moan is that a couple of my contracts were recently due for renewal, and I got the usual text/mail offering a nice new Samsung. Go through the renewal/upgrade, and get told I cannot have what I want as I have failed the Credit Check. I have no issues getting credit elsewhere, so just renewed SIM only, and purchased my phone elsewhere, and cheaper. So Vodaphone lost money there.Next thing I have a mobile broadband contract that I wish to cancel, it never gets used but costs £43.00 a month. It expired in December 22, and I still can't cancel it. Like others have said, the customer service appalling, worst I have ever come across. You speak to TOBI their automated crap bot, who is as useful as a Chocolate fire guard in a firestorm. First time I managed to get a number and spoke to a human, who then spends hours trying to convince you to stay, which I didn't want. They assured me they could convert my account to pay as you go, and I wouldn't have to keep paying, and would send a mail confirming this. Mail never arrived, and I'm still paying full whack, so total and utter BS.Today I tried TOBI again, and managed to get a live person on the live chat, immediately I start the chat I get kicked due to inactivity which was the damn wait in the queue.Went through the pain in the proverbial motions again, and... same thing happens a bit further in.Guess what Vodafone, I am going to go to my local store, and have a go there, and will create a scene if it can't be completed there. I am keeping evidence of everything I try, as if you do not sort it, I will consider legal action as you hold people to ransom.I see on other reviews on here you tell people to use Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, well guess what, I do not use such social media as I am over the age of 12!!! I have no interest in having accounts on those platforms what so ever, so how does somebody like me cancel the DAMN Contract. You used to be so good, now you are utterly useless. I will be leaving when all my contracts come up for renewal, as your customer support is the worst ever.Update: 19/03/2023Not surprisingly after the review above, which was originally 1 - Star I have managed to cancel the contract following the links supplied in the reply to my review from Vodafone. Why it couldn't have been this easy originally I can only guess it is to put people off of leaving Vodafone due to it being too difficult. However once I followed the links supplied it was easy enough to cancel the one contract I do not use, and therefore I have increased the rating to 3 - stars.",1
Paying for a 70mb+ link but actually getting 58mb!! Poor shoe,1
"Taken out a 2 year Broadband Service 500Mbs, changing over from BT 100Mbs service. Took about around half a day for the service to start but the VOIP transfer of the phone number from BT took somewhat longer. That doesn't surprise me and I wouldn't jump to conclusions the extra delay in down to Vodafone. Getting a mobile number transferred between operators  generally goes much more smoothly than transfer of landline numbers. I think it's a good deal at least for the contact period, even factoring in the ubiquitous April over inflation price increases that everyone applies.But whilst my phone number is now recognized the phone still doesn't work as they forgot to include a VOIP phone adapter in the equipment they sent me so they are having to now send through a  BS 6312 (BT) female to RJ11 male adapter separately. The order did include wired phone service  so I'm uncertain whether this omission was a mistake OR if they are just trying to penny pinch by excluding the adapter from the package. It's probably not a great idea to let people try to source their own VOIP adaptor, because there are various types with/without low pass filter and with/without ringing capacitor, and use of the wrong type could then lead to further issues.They did send superfluous adaptors for DSL which I don't need as I'm on Optical Fibre now and don't actually have a copper line any longer. In general I think they could save a bit of cost AND give a better service by matching up the equipment they send with the equipment needed for the order.The telephone  support for this problem was OK, but the link they sent via SMS for video call setup (so they could look at the connections on the back of the router) didn't work so well as the web page on the link  wouldn't let me grant permissions to use my smart phone camera whilst the ongoing phone call icon was still on screen in the foreground. So I had to drop the phone call first in order to grant permissions, and was then me on a video call for where I couldn't hear/see any one on the other end. It did the job though and I left the camera pointing at the back of the router and it became clear later that they had seen what they needed to see when they called me back (though the security questions all needed going through again). I've certainly had a lot worse support from other ISPs and was straight through to someone without waiting when I called them.The router they sent is a Technicolor THG3000. Comparable specs to the Sagecom built BT Smart Hub2 that I was using previously. Slightly more intuitive web user interface, I think. But still no 802.11ax (WiFi 6) or WPA3 security option. Would be nice to see movement from WiFi 5 as some operators are now gearing up to roll out routers with WiFi 7. I was hoping for a WiFi 6 based router, but not too surprised that I didn't get one.Update: The VoIP adapter arrived, but it still didn't have a ringing capacitor within it so everything worked apart from my phone not actually ringing when it's receiving a call. However I know the superfluous DSL filter I was sent will have a 1.0 - 1.8 uF capacitance across the 2 wire voice line side. So I connect the VOIP adapter to the router, the DSL filter to the VOIP adapter, and the phone to the voice side of the DSL filter and BINGO the phone now rings. Nothing like the diagram I was sent but it works. I have the advantage of having worked for GEC Plessey Telecoms in the past so I understood what a non ringing phone means and how to fix that. I fear that Vodafone don't understand any of it anymore because everything is outsourced in such a way that the left hand no longer knows what the right is doing and there is less and less technical expertise actually left in the company itself.",1

"Wow, I see that a lot of people are not happy with the price hikes. 10.5% CPI, 3.9% towards rolling out full fibre to more homes.

So in total, a 14.4% increase to me mid contract.Originally when I joined Vodafone, I was paying about £19 a month for 55Mbs, with the latest increase, its closer to £26.The price of my current plan is actually closer to what people are paying for full fibre, 500Mbs symmetrical download/upload. This means less value for me.I still have over a year of my contract left with Vodafone but it actually worked out cheaper for me to cancel it anyway and pay the cancellation fee.The cancellation fee is based on money that you would have paid Vodafone minus the costs that Vodafone have to pay as a result of you, being their customer. By this, I mean, they deduct tax, deduct line rental for however many months and then recalculate the tax based on the new amount.This meant that the cancellation fee for the remaining year of contract was about £82.I then found a company called Lit that would do me full fibre, 500Mbs download, 500Mbs upload for £27 a month.Based on me still being in a contract with Vodafone, they also offered me 6 months free service to cover the cost of my cancellation fee. They have also promised me that there will not be any mid contract price hikes.This means that I now have a new 24 month contract with the first 6 months free, followed by 18 payments of exactly £27. Total for 24 months, including cancellation fee is £568.Vodafone said they had a better deal as I wouldn't have to pay the cancellation fee and I wouldn't have to pay the 14.4% this April if I took out a new contract.They offered me 500Mbs download (250Mbs guaranteed) 68Mbs upload for £30 a month. Taking into consideration that CPI will be added April 2024, I estimated that my bill would increase to £35 a month for approximately 12 months. In total, it would have costed me £780 to take another 24 month contract with Vodafone.I explained the numbers to the Vodafone advisor who still insisted that their deal was some how better. A lot of attention was focused on the cancellation fee that obviously I had already allowed for and factored in when comparing what was on offer.The advisor then proceeded to try and discredit Lit, saying they have never heard of them. I forwarded a link to their website. The advisor then said there wasn't any reviews, so I forwarded them a link to trustpilot where Lit score 4.9 out of 5. The advisor said that they didn't think I would get 6 months for free and to be careful incase it's a scam. They then said that the 6 months free is probably offered because they are a business that knows its going under. I explained it was to compensate people for the cancellation fee when switching mid contract. He then said that my contract will definitely still go up with Lit as all companies have to increase contracts based on CPI. I had to send a screenshot to the advisor to prove that Lit do not hike prices mid contract. This is also true for companies like Tescos mobile who also don't increase their prices.I feel like a lot of what I was being told wasn't strictly correct, so do be careful what you believe. The chat also went on for several hours despite me originally only contacting Vodafone to give my 30 days notice.I am, however, still suprised that Vodafone have a rating of 1.3 out of 5 on here. Despite my moan above, my service with Vodafone has been fantastic over the years that I've been with them. My speeds were always where they should have been and the service was very reliable with next to no drop outs. If there ever was a problem, Vodafone were quick to get it resolved.The low rating on here is quite harsh and not really a true reflection of them as a company. I would definitely consider moving back to Vodafone in the future if they have a good deal on.Unfortunately, being loyal to one company doesn't really work in the consumers favour and quite often results in prices continually increasing the longer you stay with them. As consumers, it is up to us to shop around for the best deals.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for a long time  6 months  ago they notified me they were carrying out works on the local mast nearby where we live , we are located in a rural area ,when we moved in 4G was the only way to get broadband we invested initially  in a Vodafone router but this wasnt suitable  , we used a tp link brilliant 15mb download  23 upload , now we barley get 1_2 mb even our mobiles  only show 1bar , despite emailing  phoning  all the same response nothing wrong in the area , complained on line no response , yesterday i emailed Vodafone  GH they responded in less than an hour suggesting I contact the uk sector but sadly their is nobody  that will help all you get is Vodafone technical says its all ok , so i purchased an o2 data sim well what can i say O2  30mb download speed ,update finally  they have confirmed the service is not as expected , they have provided a new sim in the broadband unit,this increased the download to 4mb we can live with for the next 12 weeks  as that's the date when Vodafone believe the service will be back to expectation.",1
my router dropps connection few times a daynot really happy about that,1
"Good service, very helpful",1
Not happy with them. I have managed to move away from them to a different phone company.  I can't wait to do the same with my internet.,1
Broadband is good enough but I haven’t been charged since renewing my contract months ago and getting hold of a customer service agent is impossible! Why should I spend hours of my time repeatedly calling them?,1
"I rung customer service to enquire if I could use my Internet outside EU, bare in mind that I have only basic package, sim only contract.Lovely man Fauz(apologies in advance if I have misspelled your name) answered the call. He was extremely helpful and understanding. He done all he could to help me to set up my phone to be able to use roaming abroad and to receive notifications of the usage and charges, I had a very pleasant experience dealing with Vodafone customer service.But after my trip to Latin America, I must say that it was pretty horrifying to discover that there was no use of any of that at all. My phone wasn't usable abroad.  No roaming was working, I had no data of what so ever, had no signal, couldn't call nor message.  Luckily enough that I have been spending time with my friends and I have been able to use their data and WiFi in hotel.I am still very happy with the person handling the call, because he was asking for advice on my query of his manager.  But the manager who ever it was should have done his homework before misleading people.",1
"For querying a cancelled broadband order, online chatbot is hopeless, human customer services is superb.",1
"An excellent service again from Staff at the Vodaphone store in Spalding. I had a problem accessing my phone.I visited unannounced, received a warm welcome, explained the issue to them in non technical terms and they immediately started to work on the problem and resolved it. I could not fault the service. It is so much better than the stores nearer to me in Peterborough and Stamford.",1
"2 days ago I tried to put £10 into PAYG.  The site kept crashing.Yesterday I got it to accept the £10 but failed to credit.I then spent ages on the landline to get it credited.  It then showed £10.46.Not trusting it, I checked to day.  It invited me to pay in again.  When I declined the £10.46 suddenly changed to £0.46.Edd: since I wrote that, a helpful Indian assistant on Vodavone (chat) sorted it out.  So I've upped it fo 3 stars.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for almost 25 years (!)In my experience, they have been the best network in terms of reliability for signal strength. Maybe I've just been lucky with the places I've lived but others around me on different networks have often struggled...On the downside, customer services has mostly been poor to infuriating. If the reliability of the network signal hadn't been so consistent, I would have left them years ago. Vodafone have absolutely no interest in customer retention. They've never given me a deal or discount on any contract. Business is business I suppose!",1
Vodafone offering new customers Deals at £22. Loyal customers zilch. So much for caring about your current customers!!!As to your reply why do you not say this in your advert??,1
"I spent the best part of 2hrs on the phone trying to merge two accounts into one. If it wasn't for ""Amy"" then I would have probably considered leaving. Real credit and was very helpful.",1
"Recently moved to Vodafone broadband. I was not informed that I would lose my pstn line as part of the move except for the dial tone. This means I cannot use any of my telephone extensions.I raised that with them but they are not able to offer any solution. I asked to cancel the service as this is useless to me but was informed that I was out of my cancellation period. I wish I had stayed with plusnet, they offer fantastic service.Update. Vodaphone came back and offered me the opportunity to cancel at no cost . They still need to be clear on the 60mbit product that people lost the old phone line.",1
Appalling .My broadband speed has dropped to unacceptable levels compared to service i pay for . I have spent nearly an hour going round in circles going nowhere trying to rectify situation. The app is useless and trying to contact someone to speak to is impossible . The chat bot is a complete joke . Im having no choice but to cancel contract and sign up whereelse with a provider that wants to offer some level of customer care and a decent reliable service.Following on... an hour later... the bot chat kicked in and actually managed to help escalate issue with engineers. Awaiting further tests but a little more hopeful than an hour ago.,1
"Joined vodafone in may 2021, the only complaint i have is that the vodafone  coverage map is totally useless,i go to places that have no coverage but according to the coverage checker its excellent.very misleading",1
"Poor service:  I Purchased a mobile phone via Vodafone I was told there would be a slight delay then got a message item to be delivered tomorrow. When it did not arrive after three days called customer service to enquire about my phone delivery. I was told oh the warehouse have not been notified! of your order we will inform them.When I asked will I get it for next week? the customer service agent dodged the question!! TWICE,  Still Waiting!!.I will not be ordering any other goods etc. from this company.Update on the 5th day the item was delivered I was eventually notified of delivery fortunately I had made no arrangements for the day of delivery. Accordingly I have made an amendment to my Review. When enquiring/purchasing I was not informed that the phone comes with no charging plug this has to be purchased separately!.",1
"Called in to upgrade and asked for price match with EE for my new contract as the current one is expiring end of the month. I am being told I need to pay an early termination fees for upgrade, when I asked if the new contract can start straight after my current contract ends the answer to that was no.I dont understand why they cant start my new contract when the current one ends, waste of time and money.Requested my PAC code to move to EE as they are offering same deal but without extra charge for ""early termination"". Shame that an existing customer of close to a decade is being treated like this just so they can make an extra £35 when my monthly bill is £70+.Edit: Received a call from Voda representative and they were able to settle this for me without an issue. I understand what early termination fee is for but customers should be offered the ability to line up another contract straight after current one expires. Issue resolved but shouldnt have occured to begin with.",1
"It's a mixed bag with VF. When I first came back to VF there were some issues with setup on my account, namely WiFi calling and VoLTE. I was surprised to get a call from a UK representative to follow up but the accounts/network team had actually fixed the issues already. This was a pleasant surprise after past experiences.Why have I marked them down? Simple, there is far too many times, not even in ""the sticks"", where I get a good 4G signal but no data throughput at all!! There are also too many times of dropping down to 3G as well with incredibly slow speeds. It is very clear after testing that VF are relying far too much on Band 20 (B20) to give coverage but it is being swamped too easily. Unfortunately they seem to be concentrating on 5G in cities where suburban and rural areas continue to suffer dire coverage and speeds!",1
"How can another company do a cheaper tariff than Vodafone can do, on same phone, Vodafone network, 6gb data, £9 cheaper",1
"I've been with Vodafone for mobile and home broadband for years and never had any issues. I always found support efficient. However, my recent experience has wiped out any confidence that I had with them. Broadband upgrade to full fibre went off schedule when open reach didn't install the fibre optics in time.Not vodafones fault, but I was assured by vf that the install would still go ahead as planned. Waited in all  day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that the Installation date had moved by 3 weeks. Waited in all day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that it had now been moved by another 10 days.That's today.Contacted vf to find out what time today, to be told that the whole order has been cancelled, My adsl is due to be terminated this evening as part of the fibre upgrade.So I've no fibre and no Internet as from tomorrow.I'm stubborn and ordinarily I'd tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine, however the compensation due will be huge. Maybe pay for two years internet, so I'm sticking with them just for the fun of the compensation claim.edit 24.03.23:Vodafone did eventually complete my install, albiet about 38 days late.As they are signed up to the automatic compensation scheme, I was due compensation, to the tune of about £250.I did have to fight for this, however got there in the end.So whilst initially it was stressful, the compensation did end up paying about 15 months worth of my contract, and the connection has been great since.",1
I have been a vodaphone customer since April 2021.  Never a problem then in December 7th my internet stopped working. I work in care and due to Covid was working every day due to being short staffed so no time to call.I eventually called on the 18th December and had a video call with a lady. She was very helpful looked at my modem and everything but could not see what was causing the problem but confirmed my internet had been down since 7th of December which was day I had new carpets fitted. So she said an engineer would be out on Monday 20th but he didn’t turn up. My son was here on 3rd of January and fixed the problem in minutes.I then received a bill for 2 months so I called again and the caller told me engineer had called me on the 20th to say he was coming but had not missed calls on that day. She then sorted my bill so I only had to pay 1 month and insured me I would recieve compensation for all days after problem was reported. So far I’ve heard nothing. Very disappointed in poor service. Only giving 3 stars as the girls I spoke we’re really nice and as helpful as they could be.,1
"I have been with Vodafone broadband for 4 years. I have never had a problem. I moved house taking Vodafone with me and had no problems at all, although it was a hefty fee to move them with me (£60) and a month wait to get it installed, which I was told was normal across all companies?The speeds have been fine. Have had drop outs a few times a year but they are short lived and back to normal within minutes, nothing to get frustrated about. My husband says the internet is slow (we have the super fast fibre) and prefers to use his mobile data but I honestly do not notice the speed being slow, maybe because he doesn’t use it relieving the pressure of demand? All in all I would probably recommend Vodafone broadband. At the moment we are out of contract so our monthly payment is more than if we were in contract, I haven’t renewed a contract as I like the fact that I have the option to just leave if I want to, but so far I haven’t needed to. On the other hand I have had no end of trouble with Vodafone mobile contracts in the past but no problems for over a year now so fingers crossed 🤞 it stays that way.",1
Vodafone contacted me and finally removed the information from my credit reference. Thank you,1
"Eventually customer service sorted my issue, but before that it was a merry go round of speaking to different departments.My contract with Vodafone transferred to me in the middle of the month. I'd been with them for over a decade and never had problems. I'm on a plan with 25GB data per month. Then suddenly, two days into August, I get a text saying I had only 2GB worth of data left. Which made no sense as I was constantly using wifi at home and I work from home.The first person I spoke to said it was a glitch and that she would renew my data amount. Nothing happened.The second person said it was the 'transition period' of the contract transition, and that it would renew properly on the 8th of August, today. Nothing happened.On my third call, I spoke to someone who knew what they were doing and did a deep dig into my daily data use and summarised that I had used 9GB instead of 22GB when travelling the prior week, which made sense. However a colleague then told her that the day-by-day data wasn't accurate and that 22GB was correct, which also made no sense. He wasn't helpful, and reiterated it was on my end and not theirs.Under family advice I called up Retentions threatening to leave and got an extra 2GB for free as a good will gesture. Doesn't explain where 13GB went, but it's better than nothing.I will be doing better research into other providers next year as a back-up.",1
"I've been with Vodaphone for several years (phone contracts). I can't say the connection has ever been bad (so 5 stars for that) but it is hard work to call them. Is anyone any good at customer service??? On price, I have an issue. I'm way past my upgrade date and I get occasional offers 'just for me' (not explicit, but this is implied by the wording). The price has been no different to anyone else asking (i.e. via website as a ""new"" customer). Moreover, other suppliers are consistently cheaper, and by a lot. You get a £29 up front fee even for a PAYG contract on an iphone with Vodaphone, not so in other places, and it's £15 a month cheaper elsewhere for identical phone and terms. I phoned them to try to avoid the small amount of hassle to transfer my number elsewhere and offered to show proof of a better quote for the same contract. They wouldn't budge.They've largely ignored me for the best part of 10 years and within two hours of requesting a PAC code, they're phoning me! Too late, you made me feel as though I was inconsequential and not worthy of a comparable deal to your competitors.So overall, five stars for reliable phone connection, but 1 star for not making me feel like a valued customer, hence 3 stars on average.",1
June 2022:The Vodafone network has been down in postcode SK13 5DP for nearly 3 weeks. I received a text saying maintenance complete but the Vodafone network is still down in this area. There have been problems for 3 weeks now and no one at Vodafone seems to know what the problem is or when it will be fixed. Even their website shows the network is down. This is a rural area and people rely on their phones to keep in touch. Total shambles.July 17th 2022:After some investigation I have discovered that at the end of June 2022 Vodafone upgraded my local mast as part of maintenance program in preparation for 5G. The upgrade failed and the mast shutdown. My device then  connected to another mast further away greatly reducing my service (2 bars from 5 bars). The Vodafone website stated there was a fault for a few days and then said service was back to normal which it wasn't. After a coupe of weeks my service has improved and I am getting excellent down /upload speeds so it seems to have been fixed. Vodafone clearly had a problem and I just wish they would have been honest. Their contact centre and the TOBI app just lied to me or disconnected me when I tried to investigate the problem. Vodafone have provided me with good mobile service over the years but they really need to improve their contact centers who do not seem to have a clue when their is a major network outage.I have increased my rating as I am now getting excellent speeds. People on the Vodafone Forum were very helpful.,1
"Not the best service I have received, was left for too long with no response!",1
"customer service were just ok, they are expensive but not the worst out there",1
"One star, because this is the 3rd time Vodafone have screwed up causing chaos due to their clueless, incompetent and dishonest call centre staff. With her no longer needing it, I cancelled the line on our late mother's Apple Watch that has been a safety line for her. Vodafone forgot to cancel it leading to continued charges that totalled, wait for it, £12 or so. As a matter of principle, I refused to pay it and call centre staff said they would cancel and write it off - twice. A year later, they have raised the debt to £38, and it has appeared on Experian wrecking my otherwise good credit, causing chaos in my life. I wish to sue Vodafone for damages being it is impossible, even via Twitter messaging, to communicate with a real English first language human being. Their Twitter account says to use their useless online chat service! It's useless!(The other two instances: Despite arranging it before leaving for mainland Europe in 2014, Vodafone forgot to switch on travel roaming, so I was billed many times my actual call/data costs. They did refund the money/credit it, but error caused me much stress. This happened earlier too on a different trip.)Update - Sept 26 2022: Unbelievable, so Vodafone have pinned the blame on us, despite fact the account was closed and NO debt was due. What you are doing is fraud and dishonest. I spent ages on phone today to try and resolve this, but your staff needed 5 of 7 security questions answering, some of which were rediculous being we have no way of knowing dates of events long ago, forcing us to visit a store. Don’t forget, YOUR error is costing US money and inconvenience. It is unacceptable that you do not keep suitable records.Update - Matter resolved. Sad that I had to post here to get attention. Store staff v helpful. However, the confirmation email promised by call centre lady never arrived. As per my other reviews, all these issues will end when companies return to in person engagement and scrap chat bots and overseas call centres. We’re human.",1
Did not like how they managed my cell plan. So overpriced,1
Worse service out of all UK providers in my opinion.,1
Fairly average service and not cheap either,1
"Today after 7 and a half years, I received my PAC code from Vodafone. I'm not going to write a dramatic 1 star review. My signal with Vodafone is generally strong and I've had no issues with customer services. But this company has consumer ethics problems.However, since COVID, the signal has not been as strong. I used to be the only person in my group of friends who used to get a signal at the football and now I'm not, it's as bad as the rest. So when I get e-mails telling me my prices are going up because of the cost of living, I expect to see my service being excellent. But unfortunately it went backwards.My bill has gone up and up and the cost of living raise was, I'm afraid, unfair, exploitative and the final straw and the reason I am leaving today. This is from the e-mail in March:""The monthly cost of your plan will go up from your April 2022 bill. As set out in the terms of your agreement with us, this increase is the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 5.4% (as published in January 2022) to support the rise in our running costs and keep up with increased demand, plus an additional 3.9% to continue essential investment in our network as we expand coverage.""This is frankly predatory and I will not support it. So I am off to Lebara - they use the Vodafone network and will charge me about a quarter of what I currently pay with a superior deal. I am sad to be leaving, I have been with Vodafone for the best part of 8 years. But the SIM only tariffs are no longer competitive, there was no real effort to keep my custom (not that I was ever going to stay) and I cannot emphasise enough how much I dislike that 3.9% rise. My coverage has got worse, not better, so previous rises are obviously not being spent wisely.In terms of coverage and overall experience, I have had few issues with Vodafone. In fact, they're pretty good. But the time has come to seek cheaper pastures elsewhere because a 9.3% rise when cost of living is out of control is predatory, exploitative and downright unfair.So you will get good coverage and friendly customer service experience, but you will pay for it and it will be outside of the amount you agreed to pay every month.Goodbye Vodafone. It's been fun.",1
Expensive tariffs I think they could do better,1
"Whatever happened to Vodafone? Having returned after over 10+ years its very clear their customer service has diminished beyond any hope. Whilst buying a new contract via the Vodafone website store was a very straight forward pleasant experience - that I'm afraid is where the pleasant part of the buying experience ends.Speaking to anyone regarding an order afterwards is near on impossible, (waited over an hour half on hold..) live chat is as much good as a chocolate fireguard (when it working that is!) Vodafone seem to think its perfectly acceptable to fob off customers with ""DPD will be touch when your phone is ready for delivery"" while you simply wait...& wait....& wait....hardly no communication on whats going on at all? Tracking provided just sits there with no movement. Twitter support, although friendly advised my order was taken off back order & shouldn't be too long, but zero movement on my tracking.The whole experience has been totally dreadful & I really regret it. I very much doubt I'll get delivery before Xmas Day now, but I have ceased caring if honest.The whole buying process has been a pointless, time-wasting & completely frustrating experience.Whilst I appreciate when things go great few people actually give good feedback, but when its bad they are quick to criticise. I give feedback on my own personal experience (positive & negative) but honestly, do think twice before you buy from Vodafone, worst experience ever (and many think Three UK is bad, oh no..Vodafone is far far worse - I should know I've been with Three for like 10+ years)My feedback to Vodafone would be to sort out your disastrous customer care, non existent communications & false delivery promises. Sadly I expected better from Vodafone. I dont really care anymore when my order arrives as it will be promptly returned back to you for a refund.I'm no longer interested in any further interaction with anyone from Vodafone, so please dont bother with a ""copy n paste"" generic reply. The main purpose of this review is to simply give feedback to other prospective customers.Edit: Since found out via my official complaint my order didn't even exist even after taking £100, receiving all contract docs & a hard credit check on my file. They want me to cancel & re-order? Amazes me how you manage to keep customers, shocking!Edit: Resolved via Exec Office, I have increased my  score rating purely based on how exceptional my complaints case manager (Andy) & an amazingly helpful Sales advisor (Sarge) resolved this today. Be thankful you have these guys @Vodaphone they restored my confidence that ""some"" people DO care about customers within your company. Give them a medal on my behalf.",1
"Signed up for a SIM only contract and got the SIM within a couple of days. All the packaging said it was already activated but it still didn't work 24 hours after installing. I also couldn't log onto my account using the temporary password I'd been emailed. This would only ever give a message that an error has occurred and to try again a moment later.I used the webchat to complain and was told my account hadn't been activated and would be sorted within 24 hours. It wasn't so I tried again the next day to be told it would be done by midnight. Again, it wasn't so I contacted them again and got told 24 hours once again. This time I waited another 2 days before contacting them to be told it would be done by midnight. A day later and I still have no mobile.From what I can see, Vodafone are utterly useless. I've had enough and since I'm still within my 14 day cool off period I'll be ringing up to cancel later. My hopes of Vodafone actually managing that without charging me again are slim.18/03/22 A further update. I just had the most painful conversation ever with someone presumably in India when attempting to cancel the contract. The call seemed to be on a 10 second delay the whole time and mostly consisted of her saying ""Hello"" over me repeatedly. She couldn't find my account for the first 15 minutes because I couldn't give them a mobile number I didn't have. Then when she did find my account, I was told my contract couldn't be cancelled because my account wasn't active and I would need to ring back in 24 hours. After venting for a while about why I wasn't going to do this, and how this was in breach of consumer rights, she said they would ring me back on Monday between and 1 and 2.  I couldn't take any more and reluctantly accepted. This level of service is so poor it beggars belief. I'll go straight to complaints when they presumably don't ring back on Monday. If that doesn't work, next stop will be the ombudsman.22/03/22 I didn't get a call back and the account still isn't activated. I got a reply to this review from Vodafone suggesting to contact the social media team via Facebook/Twitter. I had to sign up to Twitter specifically for the purpose but finally got a clear answer that they apparently won't activate the SIM and account until the day my old number is due to switch on 1st April. This isn't how a switch has worked for me in the past but they also confirmed my cancellation period won't start until then so I'll give them a last chance. The moral of all this seems to be to avoid Vodafone's call centres and go to their social media team if you want any help.06/04/22My account activated as promised above and I've had no problems since. Still not happy with the state of the service I received or the contradictory communication about how the switch process worked in the first place but I'm revising up to 3 stars since they did at least get there in the end.",1

"been a customer on and off for 22 years, and they re not to bad, I can get signal most places, and the speed it reasonable 9 times out of 10.However, they're not cheap, don't really reward loyalty and can be a bit of a nightmare to speak to when things go wrong or you want to know or do something that is nt on the agent's script.The voice recognition thing is a very annoying as well.hence middle of the road 3 stars.In response to them below - please answer your phones don't rely on facebook, or twitter, if you want to talk to me about and it's so important you have my phone number...........",1

"When I first ordered the Vodafone deal, I was explained the discounts from my work place were applied, it wasn't and for almost a year I was paying the full contract price. Until I lost all three careers I had in a month, I had to pursue the deal to help me out of debt. It took me like 3-5 calls to customer service in Egypt to resolve this matter. The hassle and time it took get my discount reinstated was seriously out of order.Finally managed to speak to a really good customer service agent that applied the discount and 1 month free. He provided excellent customer communication from Egypt. He was smooth, understanding and delivered results. The reference of this call was (K24YBOVQ).3 stars given because I went through madness to get my entitlement by then what was the point, if all my receiving calls are going straight to voicemail. Even though my silent mode and do not disturb mode is off. This issue was raised over 2 months ago and again I was told it was resolved. But it wasn't and were back to square one again, customer agents spitting false promises. I have missed so many important calls this past year and the contract is still effecting my life other ways.",1
"I bought a mobiphone for £11:00 and had problems using it. I could not go to the shop because of the loony lockdown nonsense. I had to phone ""customer Service"" they were as much use as a chocolate Teapot.  I went back to the store in time to find out the idiot in some Asian country had changed my package by cancelling it and given me a new one and lost my  initial £10.  I was in the Harrow store and it was ""sorted out"" by some person and without telling me my new £20 on the phone was going to cost me £1:00 to send a text with 4 charactors in it!  Today customer service confirmed I was on the package I did not want nor was told about the disgusting charges.  they could do noting and their english was APPALLING! So I have destroyed the phone and gone to another provider who is simply going to charge me 5p when i send a text which is about twice a month.BEWARE OF VODFONE AT ALL COSTS.  Whatever the Sales person says make them put it in writing or walk out of the shop.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Don't bother VOdaphone you have lied too many times.  I have switched to 1p mobile who ACTUALLY do charge 1p a text rather than £1.00 a text like you swindlers!Oh and with a PAC code I can keep my numberSo GOD bless1pMobile they do let you keep your phone number and only charge 1p a text or 1p a minute for a call, and you only HAVE to credit £10:00 every 3 months A BETTER DEAL THAN ANY VODAPHONE PACKAGE.GOOD RIDDENCE!!!!!You can thank the liar at HARROW for you losing you yet onother customer!!!!!",1
Rip company bad service no reception people don't understand when you speak English,1
"The deals aren't the best on the market. I never really had an issue with them, swapped to them from EE (really disliked EE) stayed with them after my contract ended, changed to sim only contract, and when my discount on my account came to an end over a year later. I called, online chatted multiple times, got passed onto someone else, and no matter how many times I asked for the discount to be added back onto my account, they weren't arsed.They just wanted to give me less, for more money. I even quoted other companies deals that beat theirs and still didn't budge, said I'd leave and theyd lose me as a customer all together meaning 0 money at all to them.. Again not bothered.Left and went with Lebara for half the price (permanently. Not a temporary deal)",1
"I had a problem with Vodafone charging me for a while month when I had finished the service mid month. Since my last review, they have now refunded me thankfully. I still think the internet was not good though.",1
"Bad experience from start. Started live chat re concern my contract has been sent to wrong email address (  the store may have got the email address wrong).  That chat ended half down the line, I can't even log on the app to register as it asks for code which it's impossible to retrieve as we signed up got sim 4g router. Customer service  is definitely not great. The advisor I spoke to just wanted to end the call quickly and was not helpful. Better to sign up with 30days contact for sure.",1
"OFCOM regulates news outlets in the UK.Not far left activists on social media,or woke communication company's.",1
Vodafone is ok,1
"An absolute disgrace. I upgraded last September to the IPhone 12 (I moved to EE) it took countless phone calls to get them to finally cancel my old contract even though I had finish the 24 month term.They finally cancelled it in January. In June my credit score now shows 2 missed payments from them.They never contacted me about this.Not only did they basically refuse to cancel my contract for months, they then never told me they still wanted money after it was cancelled.They have completely screwed me and my credit score which will hurt me when I need a loan or mortgage etc.An utter disgrace of a company I will never use again.I want to add a P.S. after a few phones calls and a long call they took the arrears away, I wrote this review when I shouldn’t have, in the heat of the moment. During my 24 month contract they were a great company, but between last September/October to now (June) it’s been horrible, but they did take the arrears off saying mistakes were made by them in reference to contacting me about a payment etc. So fair play to Vodafone for doing it. I want to leave my review up because it really has been horrible trying to get away from Vodafone but I’m not too big of a man to realise that I wrote it when I was angry.",1
"My bill is apparently £10 but I’m being charged £17, and am unable to get through to customer service. Avoid.Edit: called 191 and eventually got through to a customer service rep.",1
I had a problem with Vodafone UK.  This has now been resolved  in my favour . Well done Clare Wilkerson from media services at vodafone UK.,1
Just upgraded but wasn't given a free Amazon voucher as offered.Dissatisfaction is the result.,1
I've had pretty good service over the years. But the process of negotiating a fairly priced upgrade is getting harder and harder,1
"Asda have transferred fron EE to Vodafone so it was either accept it or go somewhere else for my PAYG.  And there's less and less choice.Asda were 8p a minute for mobile calls with a Customer Service call centre in the North East, with great staff (who, as it happens, are employed by EE). That's all changed now. Asda Mobile Customer Service (i.e. Vofafone) are in Egypt and whilst they seem to know what they're doing and are polite and as helpful as they can be the lines aren't great (poor reception) and there isn't the same ease of conversation that there was with UK based staff.However calls are now down to 4p per minute (or they are for the time being) and you just need to make one, six monthly, chargeable text or call to keep the account active. No obligatory top up every six months.'Three' used to have something similar but their rates went up recently and their customer service was patchy. So it's all change - and it's likely to keep changing.",1

not good service - very expensive and little help,1
"A bit painful overall unfortunately, but the customer staff were as great as they could be.Saw a great offer online in March for Samsung S21 5G, Unlimited Max plan. With a guaranteed trade in of my S10e (subject to meeting conditions), £44 per month (24 months). Great deal!Placed order Wed 31 Mar after 10.00pm, so too late for next day delivery. Fine. It's Easter weekend so can wait until the following Tues.Received email confirmation 22.31 for delivery on Tues 6 Apr. Nothing delivered.On inquiring, response was that the order was cancelled due to a 'technical issue'. No reason for error given, or why no follow up email to tell me. Passed around from initial complaints to upgrades to customer care, back to upgrades, etc.... Upshot - I can upgrade but only at today's (7 Apr) rates (which, shock, are not as generous); not the one I thought I signed up to (when I got my last phone, the following month the plan price went down. I had no recourse to ask for a better rate though...)Small print online states the contract only applies 'when the product is dispatched'. Not when you click that button to purchase. Not when you get the confirmation email. Not when you get it in your grubby little mitts. But only when dispatched. As such, it appears that if the courier loses it, or it is delayed... you are still liable to pay the prevailing rate (until found or proved stolen, I assume). If the order is cancelled by Vodafone (for any one of a number of reasons - or none, just a 'technical error'...), unlucky, no contract stands. The risk is transferred to you, my friends. Tell me I am wrong, Vodafone. Then I will show you your own terms and conditions.If you order online, get a confirmation and take a day off and get no email to say it is cancelled. Unlucky as no contract. And you cannot then ask for the original terms to be honoured as the 'deal is no longer available'. Those good old T&C.What was good was the attitude of all the customer support staff I engaged with. They got it. They listened. They were obviously limited by company policy. After putting in a formal (email) written complaint since the phone system just wasn't working, I got a response very quickly and the guy was great. The key thing was the confirmation email I received, that proved I had made the order - it was the only evidence as 'nothing was in the system' (don't delete those emails, folks). Complaint upheld in terms of cancellation made without my knowledge and no confirmatory email sent to me. Nonetheless, the 'technical issue' won through and those pesky terms and conditions (weighted in favour of the company) won out. Legally right; morally...?I have to comment I did go ahead with an upgrade, after being offered 25% discount on another monthly plan; it would be wrong not to disclose this. The deal was decent but not anywhere near as good as that which I thought I had committed to.In short. Customer service were actually really decent and I truly appreciate their attempts to help. But the company-level T&C element leaves the customer in a weak position if things go wrong. You takes your chance folks!",1
Good service but needs to be more efficient when dealing with customer billing problems.I called and the representative was helpful and kind but had to keep putting me on hold to find things out.Overall happy and thanks for the refund for over charge on retail index review.,1
I have been a customer of vodfone mobile it not to bad but I would not go with the broadband it not good but ha I’m with by on broadband and there staff are really bad there made 54 bill and Service scissors people not come to fort thinks out I fand vodfone mobile are better if only the people in the mobile time work with the broadband side it mite be better but any how EE STAY CLEARE IT LIKE Jumping in front of a bus really bad I mean bad it bad talk talk we’ll I have been with them not bad but you pay for what you get slow speed lol 02 mobile stay clear as well I’m staying with vodfone yes there do make mistakes but there do sort it out in the end much but then o2 BT talk talk EE  hope this is help full 👍,1
"I recently inherited a locked to vodafone iphone, the customer service was excellent (when I finally got through) and the phone was unlocked in 24hrs. The main problem is the price and coverage. I have been with Vodafone for 20 years in business and private use. They are great if you live in a major city or only travel on motorways, in the countryside their coverage is poor and the pricing is high unless you haggle hard. Piggy back companies like Lebara offer great deals using the Vodafone network so why can't they offer better prices themselves. I think it is a stagnant company and will continue to lose private custom in favour of business clients",1
"I recently reviewed Vodafone & subsequently added an update, in both posts I slated the company both for keeping me waiting around seven weeks for finally connecting me to broadband & also for the poor customer service. Since my update things have improved a bit so I thought it only fair to also let others know they can do some things right (eventually).They admitted that the service I had received was not acceptable & for that they are giving me an £80 credit, additionally it turned out that although I had signed up for superfast 2 which is up to 63Mbps with a minimum guarantee of 55Mbps, after further tests it seems my line will only support a sync speed of 39.8Mbps, however I was prepared to accept their offer of a reduction in my monthly charges from £23pm to £19.50 as the speed I am getting is ok for my particular needs.It remains to be seen if I continue to get this speed & hopefully don't suffer any disconnections or any discrepancies with my bills.Overall though if it all stays as it is now I will be satisfied with what I have ended up with.",1
"Vodafone set us up quickly, and we had a much faster line than advertised. However, we came home one day and our Internet wasn't working. Contacted support who advised us our account had been cancelled, so they setup an engineer to reconnect us 2 days later. Still no Internet from then so phoned again and was told that the exchange was broken and that in 2 days open reach would be out to fix. Phoned back again 2 days later and was told that the open reach appointment was never scheduled and that in 2 days it would be fixed, surprise surprise no Internet 2 days later and this time told he didn't have the right materials to fix the exchange. Asked for a 4g dongle to keep us connected and were told no as we are not moving house so we asked to cancel and move to another provider, after cancelling we were transferred to customer service who offered us a 4g dongle but were told that the 18.50/month we had agreed to would be going up to 23.50/month. This all happened because apparently we are supposed to phone Vodafone and tell them that our Internet is working? Would avoid at all costs. Just spend an extra couple of quid a month and go to a better provider",1
"I've been with Vodafone for 11 years. 11 years. Now generally that means something for a lot of companies but not Vodafone. Their loyalty discounts are offensive.Anyway, it was that time to renew again. I have had sim only contracts for the last 6 years as I don't care anymore for the latest phone. I was sad to see that I could either get way more than I needed for more money or way less than I needed for the same money. Why can't I just stay on the same plan?This time I considered a phone because mine was on it's way out and thought in the end that I just couldn't simply afford it. Until I went to carphone warehouse where if I started a new contract with Vodafone I would get the latest phone (S21) cheaper than what Vodafone themselves were offering me... what a way to feel valued.I love vodafone I always have. Their signal has been amazing in my area and I love the nostalgia I feel as unlike o2 (once upon time one-2-one) they haven't gone through a name change or anything in the 30 years I've roamed England. Just why disrespect the loyal customers? Don't pretend to be offering me a deal when really I'm being ripped off.My reason for writing this review is due to the odd system I had to go through to change my mobile number from a vodafone sim only contract to my new vodafone contract. I had to order a pay as you go sim, transfer my number to that, then transfer my number to my new vodafone contract sim. WHY?! Please Vodafone, if you can - SORT THIS OUT. Along with your loyalty offers. Either genuinely offer a good deal that you cannot get ELSEWHERE or don't bother. I didn't bother calling to cancel because I don't like the Non-UK based call center.This time you keep my custom, but next time - you may not be so lucky...",1
Kinda disappointed,1
"Online contact doesn't work, automated phone help machine is useless. Help is good when you actually get to speak to someone.I can't log-in to my Vodafone online account as it's sending the access code to my landline via text message, which doesn't work.I try to contact Vodafone using the ""online"" function, but this opens a webpage that never actually loads - great.I call Vodafone, and battle an automated help machine that repeatedly tries to tell me that I can do anything I want via my online account settings (failing to understand that I can't log in), before eventually (and I mean eventually) telling me it will transfer me to someone. The phone rings a few times and then hangs up.2 minutes later, I'm about to leave a scathing review, when my phone rings with Vodafone customer services there, who take me through security and then fixes my log-in problem.So, 5 stars for calling back and fixing the problem quickly - 1 star for the online contact not working and the automated help machine.",1
Everything is slow - why does it take 1hr + to do anything with them - renewing a contract shouldn't be so painful. They also made my contract worse than before - only 100 mins in Europe instead of 500 - dont feel this was clear and appealing this so difficult. Gave up after 45 mins on the phone on a Saturday - I have better things to do!,1
Assured it was a simple process to port my number into vodafone. Its now a week and I still cannot use my phone to dial out or send messages or use data. No timescale on when it will be fixed. Unfortunately now in a position that I have ordered a sim with another company and lost my number as I don't trust it will ever be resolved.At 15:09 5 mins after posting my initial  review on trustpilot I got a message saying my port in is complete. Dont know if its a coincidence or not but changed to a higher rating on the basis its now sorted.,1
I really believe that it is the most value for money company. Very low services still though. Better for family packs.,1
"the chapest of all, but the signal is very low. good packs, especially the students packs.",1
"My broadband order was due to go live on 10th of December, but this failed and the date was stealthily moved back by 4 days, leaving me unable to work from home.Vodafone have at least tried to help though, by offering unlimited data on a SIM card so that I can continue to work. So thanks for that Vodafone, but you really should have completed my broadband order on time.",1
"Back on today after 5 days no serviceEventually sorted out ,and rectified amicably.If you contact the right people ....... it gets sorted 👍 ceo by email 😂",1
"After happily using Vodafone for mobile for years I recently moved house and got their broadband installed. To be fair, surprisingly easy to get hold of customer services via chat or on the phone, but had to speak to them SIX times just to get the router sent to the right place - not one agent I spoke to did what they said they would do until the sixth person. Systems between Vodafone and their delivery partner DPD (useless company) clearly do not work at all. Even when the router was eventually delivered over a week late ('typical' according to the BT installation engineer) the DPD guy came back later in the day to ask for the package back! I refused, obviously, and now all seems to be working fine. Pure chaos, as usual with DPD. Three stars as service eventually seems to be good, but setup process unnecessarily hectic and stressful during a house move. Vodafone you desperately need a dedicated process for people moving house!",1
"My dealings with them have been ""fine"" so far, a little expensive on mobile broadband with few options, but supposedly no throttling and truly unlimited which is nice. Would be nice to have a cheaper option for those of us in areas that don't get 5g and even very bad 4g signals.I'd be happy for a cheaper package on pure 3g but with still unlimited data. Currently I pay £33 a month for around 15mbps at best which is very expensive compared to wired/fibre broadband. It's acceptable though since I have very few choices of networks that actually serve me out here in the country.",1
Not as bad in my experience as most of the reviews. I mean fiver a month 4 payg wiv 300 mins n 3gb data plus rollover to make it 6gb! Dat is better n most cheap sim only dealsJust need better customer service loggin cuz man is always havin 2 explain imself ova n ova again....like a stuck record lol,1
"Went from 1  to  3 been completely messed around so much inconvenience ringing, emailing, online etc. Didnt bill me in the end but they need to look at their app sliders and barsMade a mistake on their app. Used the bars and sliders and couldnt work out which one was yes/no. Really confusing.Got charged £46 instead of £12 and they lad i spoke to tried to remove the charges as i hadnt used any of the data and records showed i was having problems.  Offered 10% off so i closed my 3 accounts with them. £429 a year theyre happy to lose for £36. Shocking middle management.  Ill never again use vodafone",1
"I need a replacement pay as you go SIM card and went online to order one. No facility to do that. Have to chat  to an advisor. Can't, because they don't have any. At all. None. No advisors at all. Because of Coronavirus. So I give them a ring. No advisors. At all. Because of Coronavirus. Go into a store? Nearest is 20 miles away. And why should I?Suffix: I did finally get through to an advisor, who was excellent. The new nano-SIM to replace my mini-SIM is arriving within a couple of days. So a good result.BUT come on, Vodafone, by now you should have this all sorted with advisors WFH if necessary. 'Coronavirus' is no longer an adequate excuse for under-resourced customer services.",1
Been with Vodafone for a good few years with no problems but now I think is a Joke of a company when all I want is to add the apple watch to my account.UPDATE after 5 days of emails and a big fat headache I have finally got an email saying I can have the watch that I wanted but it's now on back order which it was not the first day I tried to order one. So really I will have waited 10-12 days just to get an apple watch which is a sad amount of time messing about3 days have passed and still Vodafone has not sent a stock up like email says this is getting beyond a joke. A mate applied for the same item today and is getting his apple watch delivered tomorrow. Joke joke joke,1
Vodaphone treats Channel Islands as an International Destination and charges accordingly which is ridiculous or a deliberate rip-off. For £3/month you can have 100 free minutes to 100 international destinations around the world but the Channel Islands is not included in this list despite being only 150 miles away - this tends to confirm it is a deliberate policy to maximise earnings.,1
"I got my phone+sim plan on Carphone warehouse. Vodafone was the one I picked and during 2 years, I never had any complaint, to be honest. Good signal, very clear bills and internet speed was good.But after 2 years, my contract ended and I received a phone call asking if I wanted to renew.Since I wanted the Samsung S20 but the price was higher than what I could afford, I was told that I could do a SIM-only plan and upgrade after 3 months to add a phone. Note that the employee didn't mislead me.The problem is that now, I went to check the upgrade plans for a new phone (S20 for example) and if I do an upgrade, I will pay more 200 pounds at the end of 2 years, compared to if I got a new plan.The problem is that I am stuck in a 2 years contract...where I am losing, and any new customer for Vodafone gets better deals than me that I am a customer for 2+ years.Loyalty not only means nothing to Vodafone, also it seems they laugh at your face by having awful prices for ""loyal"" customers and great prices for whoever is a potential customer.Once I finish the 2 years, I will change to another operator that hasn't played me around like this.So people, you know it, is your first plan? maybe accept. Renew? Don't be a fool like me....",1
"So this review is really just to warn Vodafone and their customers, my wife ordered an Ipad with Vodafone and it was delivered by DPD and their driver left it lying on my front doorstep for anyone to steal. I was lucky that a neighbour took it in, but it made me wonder how many other parcels he left on peoples doorsteps. Totally disgusting.",1
"After giving Vodafone a bad review last time, they have been very helpful with a problem with intermittent broadband, which is down to a fault on the line,its obvious as the phone doesn't work!!!I just find it stupid when you ring up to speak to someone about broadband not working you get a recorded message to say its quicker to go onlinewhen you cant go online GRRR",1
I bought the sim card advertise 15 GB Data and 250 min  sim card arrive late even than they give 500mb data a day and daily usage £1 its a joke someone legally selling online sim card display 15gb data and 250 min for £10 month  once you buy they put on sim plan only . and even than they overcharge on daily plan . than they refund after long argument.very bad companythat is ripe off in day light . this complain will fwd to offcom .cusservice people hang the phone once i call them in first call . they promise manager will call you in 24hrs 48 hrs gone no one call so far  again call they put request to speed up and someone call you still pending .Know they call me and give me bundle as i paid for.but gone through lot of issue once it actually arrive finally.,1
"It has taken months to get my speed problem fixed, though I realise COVID and OpenReach should bear a lot of the responsibility. Even so (this accounting for the 3 stars), their service personnel are excellent, friendly, efficient, apologetic!! I was particularly impressed by Kirsty and Mohammed Saif -- their service skills are outstanding.",1
"pretty good broadband and mobile contract, useless customer service.had a problem while switching broadband, they prosponed connection date by 2 weeks then the offer i was signing up for expired. they put me on a contract that was 50% more expensive including the bonus i got for being an existing mobile customer. after 2 months i was refunded but most of the customer service people could not help, then by strike of luck i got through to someone who did know what they were doing. None of the previous conversations were noted on account but im just happy its sorted.the broadband is exactly what i now payed for and never had a problem with the mobile side of things.",1
"Ehab was so helpful! I’ve been having problems with bringing my phone number over from an old sim to my new one (hence the 3 stars due to delays and previous customer service experience when calling to ask how to swap it). I called the complaints department and was put through to Ehab, the most cheerful, patient and helpful person I’ve ever spoken to on the phone. I called looking for actual help not to complain about the problem which I’m sure they get a lot. The problem is not yet solved but hopefully will be in the next 24hours. Just wanted to let the company know what an asset they have in him.",1
"I can say i'm a fairly new Vodafone user, and their customer service has been good so far, with one exception of an incident.. that was mostly due to a misunderstanding. Still, gotta be cautious with my rating.",1
"I mean, not that bad...",1
I have been frustrated with my signal in London for a while now and no matter how many times I call the helpline nothing changes.,1
So far on accepting order seems good will review when service active surely they cannot be as bad as a BT company rep saying BT equipment and company crap,1
The broadband is incredibly unstable. We had no issues with previous supplier so really regret switching to Vodafone now. They're also not responding to my complaint. Avoid.*Update: to be fair to Vodafone they've since kept in weekly touch with us to try and resolve this for us.  Matter still ongoing at the moment.,1
"I have been a Vodafone customer for the past five years. It's ok, but not great. Customer service could be better especially waiting time. But overall ok service.",1
"Been with Vodafone for 14year (mobile). Just upgraded, the rep gave me 40% discount which was a mistake on their behalf. But they tried to get me to pay for their mistake. After a lot of phone calls and telling me customer services would phone me back at a certain time, they would phone me at the wrong time, eg at work the next day. In the end they gave me 30% off and the difference for the 24 month contract. So got to thank you. Because it got sorted hopefully will continue with them as I have never had a problem with them before. Their fair if you set your case.",1
"Website has been trashed, can no longer easily set up payment methods, i cancelled 2 mobile broadband numbers and nothing actually happened their side, had to call up again a month later and ask the same thing again. The customer support needs sorting out or self service online website like before.",1
Recent great customer service from a Melissa.  She had gone way beyond expections and due to me being a penisioner it was very hard.  Warmst regards from myself and Mrs Jones.  Just wish there was a easier way to get through.,1
"Used Vodafone broadband for two landlines. Similar experience with bothThe Good:No problems with router and broadband service was reliable throughoutThe Bad:During activation, messed up the landline numbers for numbers I've had for years. Why ?  I've switched between BT, EE, PlusNet and TalkTalk before with no messing up of landline numbers. But Vodafone seem to do it :-(  To their credit they eventually restored the old numbers but I spent several days with a different landline number which means friends with your old number cannot call you and two factor authentication call back services (e.g. HMRC) are non-operational until the old phone numbers get restored. Other providers simply don't cause this hassle - why do Vodafone when they also use the BT OpenReach networkBilling system charges for services that Vodafone no longer supply. In two cases Vodafone generated bills for services that were already out of contract and had already been switched and transitioned to another supplier. In case #1 they said the next bill would credit the overpayment -- it didn't, it simply carried on billing for the service no longer being provided -- so more complaints. In case #2 the exact same story -- the next bill will be a credit -- except it is not a credit, it simply carries on billing. This billing practice is shocking -- I wonder how many other people are simply being billed when they switched away long ago ?Complaints line only seems to handle mobile complaints. Broadband is ""another department"". Took 5 phone calls and 2 disconnections to get through to make a complaint and various tall tales were provided about me having to request refunds from my new broadband provider and having to provide Vodafone 30-days notification when switching despite OFCOM rules clearly saying otherwise. Again, simply shockingSummary: Broadband OK, but initial setup and billing when you move away are sub-standard. My goodness you need to watch these supposedly reputable suppliers",1
"I have mainly enjoyed saving more on their rewards system than paying in bill, but my personal win aside they are just ok Tobi inside their app is just useless and don't bother with one of there advisors as they won't tell you anything useful. Was given three different pieces of information on whether my plan had roaming inside the eu but they have not been as bad as some other companies I have dealt with recently.",1
"I have to say, as being “tech-Savy” I am appalled at how firstly, customer service is and secondly, why you won’t return my call or reply to my emails about my bill. This is now 2 months bills that I’ve gained extra charges for abroad (when haven’t left UK since Oct 2019)Disappointed as I have been with your provider since I was 19.",1
"Data is good everything is good except from the call quality, the call quality is really vague and not crisp quality compared to other networks",1
"Latest Review (three-and-a-half stars)The company answered my questions forthrightly over the phone and also put the price down from what it was, which was a nice surprise, the service now being (substantially more) worth the monthly cost.Technical-wise, the internet has been impressive, able as we are now, to stream without interference, the BBC at best-quality, sometimes, and (not a fan of...) Amazon Prime at best-quality.Am hoping to implement call-forwarding, in attempts to try out different routes for connection, and if everything goes as well as it currently does, am thinking it might work.No reason to change company as-of-yet and am pleased to have stuck around for the long-haul.The deficit in the star-rating is the issue of mobile-phone protocols: on 3G-only phones, you cannot be on the internet and a call at the same time (why I am trying call-divert), which does not allow for the fact that some people use older phones.Older Review (company had two stars)In trying to think of positive things to say about the public sector and PLCs and communication companies of the private sector, have found it immensely difficult.This particular mini-dictatorship does at least provide fast enough speeds behind the hype. And as such, am able to stream live-TV using Mobile Hotspotting.However, those who take up the helm in the handling of customer queries (in particular, those higher up the ladder-of-ambition, snugly buckled into their Imperial Fleet seating arrangements), unfortunately do not seemingly have any business training, personable skills or sense of ethics under their belt to undertake such bouts and in doing so deliver way under an acceptable standard in these areas, whilst making efforts to conceal attempts at enforcing the dark-side.The company does as such:They advertise Unlimited Mobile services and yet the services are very much limited -1. Wildly fluctuating downloads speeds - down to minimal speeds (they do pick up as well; hence the two-star rating)2. Huge latency figures (a known issue)3. Bandwidth that is so narrow that one cannot make a phone-call and be on the internet at the same time4. Dystopian rule (we are not sons and daughters of their clonèd regime)Personal experiences:When asking for a 'letter of deadlock' was told that a gratuity they had GIVEN and of which I made sure - in writing - was a gift-of-no-clauses, stated they would retrieve the fifty-pounds (already-banked) by force if I requested a 'letter of deadlock' in order to take the company up on the bandwidth issue.They came up with the resolution, to grant a piece of equipment that might help to widen the bandwidth and after I checked with their technical team as to whether this equipment would actually sort out the problem, and to which I received an affirmative, the offer was retracted, Vodafone continuing to refuse making satisfaction.Their advertising does not stipulate that Mobile Hotspotting will consist of poor performance but instead makes out that one is getting a super package for the price when in fact the amount is approaching the price for a broadband and phone deal that some (other) companies offer.I am fairly convinced that there is deliberate and secret capping of services as the company tries to push customers onto broadband deals instead of the monthly sim-deal accounts because line-broadband deals make more money, i.e:- instead of being an all-inclusive phone and internet deal, customers that are paying for a line-connection (with Vodafone) would have to pay equal to monthly mobile phone and internet prices for broadband-internet alone...plus...whatever else for a phone-line. Many-a-time told there would manifest some kind of resolution, advertising literature for broadband would instead be thrown at me.After having been kept in an online chat for about five to six hours, any ideas whatsoever as to some kind of resolution were voided, except for the (repeated) solution - not initially linked with this complaint - put forward in particular by those representing the company's CEO, to leave the contract free of charge.The problem comes down to the fact that these companies do not respect the duty in their hands to deliver a high standard of service because they do not value the technology that is in their hands at the outset - wrong people in the wrong jobs.Essentially, we are talking about professional advertising that masks back-street trading.",1
Okish the best and customer service is average,1
"3* for broadband but 0* for all else!Warning: Vodafone deny all responsibility for missing Amazon vouchers!I applied to Vodafone January 2020 because of their well advertised £100 Amazon voucher offer with the claim that I'd receive an email after 120 days for such a voucher.120 days have passed and whilst the fiber broadband has been acceptable (not really surprising because ultimately it's BT that provides the connectivity infrastructure and so that's not physically changed from when I switched from Sky), no Amazon voucher was forthcoming.This was despite it being clearly advertised on the first page of the Vodafone application journey.Having queried this initially with Vodafone they were initially very helpful and indicated the date at which 120 days is met.This however came and went, so my subsequent web chat with Vodafone resulted in them effectively denying all responsibility for the missing voucher - despite it clearly being shown as part of **their** application process; instead trying to suggest that because the offer was provided by the website *from which** I clicked to get into the Vodafone website!In fact they also claimed the offer was non-existent at the time!I don't think that just because the deal was shown on the MoneySavingExpert.com website from which I clicked though to the Vodafone website to apply is at all responsible for honoring the voucher code somehow!Either way it is completely unacceptable for my to chase a voucher that formed part of the original application and thus my contact with them!UPDATE: 06/06/2020 - After getting in touch with Vodafone, and writing this review, and also then chasing the 3rd party voucher provider Vodafone mentioned during my complaint, surprise surprise I received an email from the 3rd party company within hours! Not sure what happened to resolve this, apart from my frustration in having to chase this up myself, but I have increased this review from 2* to 3* as my complaint is now fully resolved; still - I shouldn't have had to complain in the first place (hence no higher rating!)",1
I am grateful that there are people like Masry (a person who works for Vodafone). We just signed a contract with this company and we had two problems that he was very good at solving. Happily there are still people like Masry doing their job properly.,1
"Nothings ever straight forward with them, never get signal, horrible customer service, only reason I have left 3 stars is that they are very cheap",1
"I've been with vodafone for a couple of year now. Great service for data and text's, had a few issue's with calls in the home. not always working.My Main gripe with vodafone is that there customer service has no empathy when you can't pay your bill due to the on going crisis that the world is experiencing in which my job was no longer available and i ended up on benefits. After contacting vodafone if they could reduce my plan and help me to manage my bill's during this particular time, all i got was upselling me with new products. Now for me i'm struggling to pay my phone bill, why would i buy more products from yourselves.On top of this, constantly getting daily SMS's after i have spoken to Vodafone customer service with a 'Promise to Pay'.I believe Vodafone customer service needs work to keep there customer's happy and loyal.",1
"Absolute nightmare. I went for a simple upgrade via chat and they placed the wrong order. Since January I've been trying to fix it. Contacted them several times. I've spoken with at least 15 customer services representatives and spent at least 10 hours. Every time they say ""don't worry. I'll fix it"" and every time they fail. I was suppose to pay £17 a month and I ended up paying £27. It's all in the chat logs that I saved. And every time they agree it has to be fixed but they don't fix it.Update: June 2020. I've been contacted by a complaint team and they provided a solution that is acceptable. This has been fixed for now but it took me months to fix.",1
"Overall my experience with Vodafone has been pretty good. The service is great, and the prices aren’t too bad.However when it comes to telephone customer service, there is much to be improved upon. For instance I phoned up to enquire about why I had additional charges on my bill and the person I spoke too could barely understand let alone speak English... honestly. Some staff who are not completely clueless and actually understand what is being said would be a great addition.",1
"After reading some reviews about Vodafone I thought I would share my experience with you.I have been with vodafone mobile for 15 + years as they are one of the best in my area all thou I have had signal issues over the most of those years even in my house,after lots of calls to vf over the years they supplied me with a sure signal box free of charge and that made my phone calls from home better,still have issues from time to time around my local area.How ever after years of being with EE broadband I decided to try vf as they was doing a decent deal.Set up was pretty easy and all went well to start with then ,things started to change after a few months the broadband speed and connectivity was good but wifi issues started accruing wifi keeps dropping and it will not reach my garden,(never had any issues with EE ). I have phoned vf many times about it and all though the staff are very helpful  it is some time a nightmare to get hold of,they have talked me through a few changes to my settings to try and sort thinks out and they seem to work for so long and then back to drop wifi issues and sometimes I have to re-enter my pass word to reconnect on numerous occasions it keeps telling me I have entered my password wrong, sometimes I have to enter two or three time before it excepts the code,the last time I spoke to vf they advised me they they don't guarantee wifi signal which was a bit of a blow as I have never had any problems with EE. Roll on to the end of my broadband contract with vf so I can try someone else.If I get a reply from vf team please do not ask me to contact them on social Media as I do not use any of these platforms.",1
"Contemplated between 3 and 4 stars and would like to explain. Originally myself &hubby took out mobile + internet for 18 months which ended in Feb 2020 and they did't contact us to discuss extension. Original set up of broadband and billing was a nightmare (what was agreed vs what was billed) and some friends had same experience, but sorted our eventually but ONE GREAT thing was that for 20 months we didn't receive silly post every 6 months stating our bill will go up by 10% (as it was with horrific Virgin Media). ONE BAD thing is that my husband doesn't have work phone and had to use his phone for work in March (during pandemic) forgetting he had 500 minutes/month in phone calls he never came close to using! One day he receives a warning text saying he exceeded his normal £10/month bill by £90!!! After some persuasion (and calls) they reduced the bill by £50. This unfortunate experience brings us to ANOTHER GOOD THING is their customer service who were working from home (disjointed broadband and mobile departments) after a long call managed to pull it together and get us a renewed contract for further 18 months at a bargain price (broadband + mobile). TalkTalk and NowTV have problems with answering to customers and don't have people working from home it seems! THIRD GOOD THING is that we got my 91-year old father-in-law a SIM ONLY (UK only) unlimited minutes on his mobile for only £8/month. The cheapest deal and perfect to know the price is fixed! GOOD overall, but need some improvement on initial account set-up and more collaboration between mobile/broadband departments.",1
"Their phone service in terms of signal and 4G reception is very good.Their business retention model is awful however. My contract came to an end and I tried to negotiate one of the packages they offer through third party agents but was told that I couldn’t do so and only got offered their standard packages with a 15% discount.I turned them down and asked for my PAC number so that I could take my number elsewhere. That part went smoothly.I signed up to Asda on a 30 day SIM only deal that was much cheaper and provided much more data with the same service, home or abroad as offered by Vodafone - but for £5.00 a month cheaper than Vodafone’s best discounted offer to me.I considered trying their cheaper sister company VOXI but the reviews were off putting, especially if you were porting a number. I also cannot understand how VOXI can provide a roaming service abroad, but Vodafone basics doesn’t. Work that one out - they are fundamentally the same company after all.To summarise; I got more data, the same call and text limit - international roaming etc, plus an efficient UK based Call Centre, all for £5.00 a month less than Vodafone’s best bespoke deal  - with a 30 day contract and even kept my mobile number.",1
"They're alright.Seem to have one of the mobile best networks in the UK - can get decent signal even in the middle of nowhere. But their prices are simply more expensive than their competitors, you only get a decent deal when you threaten to leave, and even the guy that was meant to try and convince me to stay agreed and owned up to also having a contract with the provider I was switching to.Their support isn't great, but it's no worse than their competitors.",1
"Decent customer service, one person did straight up lie to me, but other department were very good at keeping up communication.Service itself is subpar, found far more consistency with o2, but still the service has been much better than EE at least in my experience in the UK. Prices don't help this out any.",1
"As a family we have had mobile accounts with Vodafone for many years.  We spend a great deal of time in Turkey and the fact that the country was on Vodafone's 'roam free' list (and no other UK provider does this) was the principle reason we had been loyal to them.  So when they announced in March that they would be removing Turkey from the list it came as a bit of a shock.  A quick calculation showed that it was going to cost me up to £1500 a year to stay connected when abroad.  I rang Customer Service in disgust, adamant to let them know how cross I was, before moving all my accounts.  The gentleman was very calm and understanding.  He said that because I was a 'long standing' customer they could place all my phones onto some form of 'special account' that meant I could keep the free roaming in Turkey.  Oh here we go, I thought, he's trying to sell me a bolt on.In fact it's actually worked out cheaper than before!  Why they couldn't have just done that automatically without me having to get enraged I don't really know.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for 8 years but I am now moving to another mobile network.My experience with Vodafone has actually been quite good. I have no major complaints.I would say that the monthly phone contracts on Vodafone with a handset are slightly dearer than other networks. However, the RED bundle is great value for money as it comes with a choice of various entertainment packs (Sky Sports, Spotify, etc).I was also given a substantial discount on my current contract which I would not have been able to afford otherwise. I felt extremely valued as a customer who had been with them for so long. Unfortunately, I do not believe they offer this kind of discount anymore.The mobile phone coverage has never let me down. As I have no first-hand experience with any other network, I am unable to give a direct comparison. But e.g. at concerts, my friends' would often be unable to get 4G but I never found myself in that situation. Extremely reliable from my experience.However, the only minor annoyance when I was told that I should wait until or around the date of my termination to transfer my number over to another network, otherwise I may get charged an early termination fee (ETF). I was told this around 3 weeks before my contract came to an end. I had my eye on an extremely good mobile phone deal at the time but I did not want to risk having to pay the ETF so I waited. Unfortunately, the deal quickly disappeared. I called Vodafone again 2 weeks later only to find out that whoever had informed me about the ETF was wrong and that I would be okay if I transferred my number at any point as I had already paid all that was due.A slightly disappointing end.",1
Last night I received my PAC code from Vodafone and they said if I stick with Vodafone I can get up to 30% off and gave me a link to chat. I clicked to chat and went through security then I was told that I needed to speak to another department so I was passed on immediately and spoke to someone else after going through security again I discussed the offer I had off sky mobile and the discount from Vodafone so we discussed that and I was told I needed to speak to another department and could take up to 20 minutes to get through. 35 minutes later I finally got to talk to somebody. She told me the best she could offer was £49 per month (despite speaking to of of their partner companies earlier in the day and I was given £43). After a lengthy discussion and being told she couldn’t do any better she said that there is another department who can possibly give be a better offer. This was 2 HOURS after I started speaking with them. I was not happy but eventually I agreed to speak to the other department. The 4th person I spoke to was called Rachel and within a few minutes after going through security for a 4th time and over 2 hours of chatting with them I was given the following offer:iPhone 1124g dataUnlimited callsUnlimited texts12 months insuranceCan upgrade after 12 months1 year subscription to apply TV£42 per monthTWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER I ended the chat after speaking with 4 different people. I got a decent offer but it should not have taken that amount of time!,1
Terrible customer care unless you speak to a human. I tried to cancel my contract but took nearly an hour on the 'chat' service and they were useless - I got nowhere. So I tried to get hold of someone human and she was great. It was concluded quickly.So my tip - speak to a human.,1
"Disappointing! As a long-term customer Vodafone mobile there was little incentive to get broadband with them. The offer was not attractive including having to lose my  landline telephone number and hanging around for an engineer to call. TalkTalk could just do it directly, so I would be able to keep my landline number and would have no need for an engineer to call round.",1
Disgusting service. They eventually admit they made a mistake which has marked my credit file and have spend the last 12 months chasing them to fix it and pay the compensation they promised. Now I have just been told since my account is closed I cannot be given any compensation at all. What a joke they were happy to send my information to a debt collector twice and not even attempt a call to me when their mistake made them think I owed them! Not so quick to cough money up when it’s the other way round. They’ll happily take your hard earned money with any excuse but put barriers up when giving it back. Hypocrites-- Update --I forgot all about this but it did eventually get sorted once through to a complaints staff member based here in the UK. This team seemed a lot more willing to help and a lot less shrouded in processes. took them two 15 minute calls to sort and then confirm they had corrected my credit file. so I've updated my score a little to reflect the good staff that they do have. I suspect its more a case of process being crap rather that the people,1
"I have had a Vodafone mobile contract for years and years and my package works well for me (sim only).Staff at my local shop our helpful and pleasant.Where it all goes wrong is in customer services and accounts.Talking to someone in India is potluck if they understand your issues with phone and/or account.I was tricked into automatic payments when they asked on line if I wanted my card details to be saved. I asked for that to be undone, but to no avail. Then I got a message this month that my bill was not paid, although on the bill it states that it will be taken from my account. Totally crap and annoying.",1
"Positives:Good 4G speed & respectable roaming countries (not as many as 3 but better than the other networks)Good PAYG rewardsNegatives:Customer service is never in sync, they don’t seem to log the important parts of a call so you always have to explain the issue all over again to another person!Indoor service is hit and miss",1
Home wifi is seriously not good enough. Sort it out Vodafone.,1
"Been with Vodafone 12m, leaving as they are increasing the tariff inside the 18 month contract I originally took out. It's not a big price increase but the service has dropped dramatically in the last 4 months and there are much better offers out there at the moment. We stream Netflix and have our mobile phones connected to the wifi for the baby monitor, no gaming etc so nothing really hammering the resource.Netflix (via amazon firetv) repeatedly cuts out/freezes/disconnects and when it does come back on, can be painfully slow to reload and results in a very pixelated picture. The signal has also seemed to decrease in range - cuts out in rooms where it was fine.Wifi on the mobile phone can cut out throughout the day and also the TV so it's not an evening/heavy use period problem.Customer service (via chat) on the occasion I did contact them were relatively helpful. I've generally had no issues up until the service getting so much worse. Quite glad to have the tariff increase to release me from my contract!",1
not a bad deal. spoke with 3 teams to manage my switch. got there in the end.,1
"My experience with Vodafone Customer Service both in the UK and off-shore was poor. From scaremongering tactics regarding the life of handsets to a very uncaring attitude towards a loyal customer of many years.All that changed when I contacted the CEO of Vodafone, Nick Jeffrey, whose email address is easily obtainable on-line. The matter was handled really well by Caleb Schofield of their Executive Team. He actually cared about customer retention and went above and beyond.You shouldn’t have to go to those lengths but clearly it works.",1
"I have Vodafone broadband, phone, mobile, ipad... that is it!  They usually deliver good service.  Their customer care is a sad, sad case though! Barely any indoor signal, yet they argue with me that miles away on a little computer they see I should have good phone signal...not gotten through to them as yet",1
(Irish Customer) (POSTED HERE DUE TO NO REPLIES FROM IRISH BRANCH) Paying 55 euro a month for 250 gb mobile broadband and over the last few months speeds have been dropping like crazy up until a few days ago the network was just about usable. Now im getting speeds as low as 0.09 mbps. And ive reported it to support every other day and im told your problem is being forwarded to out technical team. And there has still been no improvement. Reason for the 3 stars is due to there being the odd 2 or 3 support workers that were genuinely nice and tried to help as best they could. Which is a lot better than i can say for the rest. Service needs to be improved in areas where 4G may not be so easily accesible and customer support needs a complete re-do. (WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD REPLY VIA E-MAIL ETC...) And thank you for your time.,1
Mediocre phone company that add too many hidden extras.,1
"I like Vodafone for some points and I hate Vodafone for other points. About over month ago I was disconnected ( few min after I paid my bill, and I have 4 items so pay a lots ). All day I was calling 191 and been promised that they will connect me back in 2 hours in 15 minutes. Non of agent was helpful. They said technical problem . Next day all the same I called 191 over 10 times and nothing happened. Eventually I upgraded me plan what make me connect again so I done myself as they was to stupid to doit. They give some compensation apologies for being useless and unhelpful. Anyway 2 weeks ago I placed order for iPhone 11 and iwatch 5. Day after I desited to cancel order iPhone but keep watch and change watch from trade in offer just to normal without giving my old watch back. Women on the phone, well not just her because I called few times as I did not received any email confirmation, so they all guaranteed that iPhone 11 order is cancel and watch will not have to be trade in. I was shocked when week later iphone 11 arrived and week later watch with envelope for old watch to trade in. So all upside down. When I called man on the phone was yawn and can’t help. Anyway I think Vodafone are ok but all these agents from 191 are pathetic lier and don’t know the job. I rather go to shop then talk with these horrible agents. Even while they talk they not put interest or any attention and do everything wrong . How bad customer service how agent ca yawn or other was eating I can clearly hear . Is so bad .",1
"They falsely advertise their broadband speeds, speeds might be 15-40mbps although they advertise 55 minimum guaranteed. Their money back guarantee is only a discount of 15%.They can’t even keep their paperwork in check, I spent half day calling them going to Vodafone centre to prove that my contract says that I can cancel 30 days after my installation. Still don’t get it why I had to prove them that because they should have a copy of my contract.Long story short their broadband is **** their customers support is even worse and they can’t even get their paper work in check.Edit:ill bump it up to 3 stars because of  their Directors office response to my online complain, where they understood what was the issue and that it was an unusual case due to my contract setup date and instillation date being unusually far apart in which time they changed their return policy",1
"I had to wait almost 40 minutes on the phone for just a simple enquiry ,but they did eventually sort things out. I just think they need more people manning the phone lines!",1
As long as you don’t have a problem Vodafone is a great network. If you have a problem it will take ages to get through which is seriously annoying. Then you either get a fantastic PERSON or someone who doesn’t have a clue or gives darn who or what you want.,1
"I've had a decent experience from their supply of coverage, but when coming to upgrade their costs are just far too high in comparison to others. Should value their existing customers more than simply trying to bring in new ones.",1
"not good, not bad. was in Europe for a trip and use this one. I think this kind of service must be cheaper",1
"So I have two mobile phone contracts and a home broadband contract with Vodafone and I'll start with the first mobile.Mobile 1 for my son was due an upgrade so we called to see what could be offered as I spend quite a bit with vodafone. No offer of discount was forthcoming to match EE prices so we took out a contract with EE, there was a little more time on the vodafone contract to run which I was happy to sacrifice when moving over.  Note: corporately I can get 20% with EE (previously my employer was with vodafone and they too gave 20%) but I've been a loyal customer for more years than I can remember so have stayed with them.I recently called to give the 30 day notice to cancel the contract foe mobile 1 and there was the retrospective offer from the cancellations team oops too late for that now new contracts signed and out of cool off period .Over to mobile 2, I see you have another phone, do you want to upgrade? I'm not quite due one yet, that's ok said the operator we can sort that out for you. A variety of plans were mentioned and then the unlimited plan along with a 20% discount was offered which was very interesting indeed.  I gratefully took this offer up.I'm now two weeks later and the whole area that i live in has home broadband connection problems.This is not normally an issue as I would tether from my mobile. This is where what I thought was a fantastic deal, was far from it. My mobile speeds have dropped at least 30mbs making working from home ridiculously difficult. After being on the phone for the faults relating to the home broadband I then spoke to the customer service team to discuss hope they can rectify the speeds, 3 teams later and my options are1. Upgrade to the max unlimited plan, current discount will not be applied2.  downgrade my plan to what I previously had, this has a discount applied and will be retained. No mention of returning handsetor3.  return my handset and go back to my old contract.I will be returning my handset and when the appropriate time comes along will be cancelling all my contracts with Vodafone.I'm not asking for much  just a reasonable speed on a phone contact that I still pay quite a sum for. Returning the phone will also mean I have a branded, new case that is of no use to me, for now.So a phone call that took more than 40 minutes to a customer services teams, with no willingness to retain a customer, is 40 minutes I'll never get back and Vodafone has lost another customer. Whether this is a result of their systems being inflexible or  the people being inflexible I'll never know.23rd July updateI went in my lunch break to The Lock, Swindon with the intent on handing back my phone, the assistant listened to my experience over the weekend with Vodaphones customer service teams and to cut a long story short, with authorisation from the regional manager, I retained my original 20% discount and my speed upgraded.  So credit goes to the assistant that actually listened to me, sorry I do not know his name but thank you very much. The team over the phones really should take a leaf out of his book on how to treat loyal customers. If I could give an independent score for the assistant in Swindon he would look get a 5 star rating.",1
Phoned to enquire about changing to another provider once this contract ran out as they had better offer. Agent said he could give me a quote to see if I would stay. Okay and he quoted me a deal on the phone I wanted for 45 a month. More then the other provider but close enough I said ok for loyalty sake. Within 20 minutes I got confirmation email saying phone works be sent out for contract at 53 a month. Phoned to point out the mistake to be told the agent gave me the wrong price. They checked the phone call and yes I had been quoted 45.... Got put through to numerous different teams with each time the story well get it sorted... Almost 2 hours later.... No we won't honour the quote...I shall take business elsewhere...Update - The complaint team phoned me back and a very nice man offered his sincere apologies for what he could understand was not great customer service....very nice man as said....then he suggested he put me  through to their resolution team to see what offer they could make on back of this experience....ok.....waited in queue to then get a person quote me exact same price i was complaining about....give them their due...they stick to their guns and will not budge an inch ...i'll go elsewhere where cheaper offers from Vodafone abound for 3rd party suppliers...but not for 'valued' customersUpdate  - ok got a phone call from another sales team person.... Apparently not connected to my above gripe.... Anyway he offered me a much better offer on a new phone... Not quite what was offered before but very near... Person was very polite ... To be honest they have all been very polite... So I have accepted and updated my stars to reflect my restoration in customer service given.....Update...after a few months i looked at the details of my package on phone app....turns out the packaged offered by above was not what i was given....yet again they lied about what they could offer...Update - Eventually got through to someone who listened to my story and fixed there and then....updated my account to what was initially offered and added a discount for my troubles....if only all experiences were like this.....from sound of it call was offshore (i guess India??) but the lady was top notch and so helpful...so i update stars to 3......shame it took so many attempts to get someone who bothered to take the time to help and knew what they were doing....which other staff  clearly didnt.,1
If you have a problem with Vodafone Broadband or mobile and you mention it here it looks like you have to be on Twitter or Facebook to get an answer from Vodafone. I'm not on those two platforms and I have no interest in signing up to get what probably won't be an answer to a problemUpdate:Hey yourselfIt would be nice if you could mention some of the more old fashioned ways to contact you going forward.

"I had broadband with vodafone for a couple of months. Then I was moving out so we used the transfer of ownership. Apparently, we had to fill in the form a couple of time, give them multiple phone calls, and even then they charged both of us. After that, they told me that the money is now on the vodafone acount, so that's all sorted. But I could not get it back. I had to wait another month. After many chat online, phone calls, around 5 redirections, I finally now was told that I will get my money back by the end of the next week. Just imagine.EDIT: I've updated to 3 stars to reflect the stability of the internet when I lived there. The internet was always meeting its minimum of 52mb.",1
"Unfortunately I just changed Broadband and phone provider to this company. The Broadband switch website reviews were quite positive, so stupidly I ignored Trustpilot. Thought I was going with a quality reputable brand - my god I wish I'd stayed with BT no issues there. Wifi is SLOW, their router/modem poor, I can't link up my TP Link powerlines and can't use my TP link fast modem/router - they will not let you use a third party router/modem - despite telling me you could pre purchase and a couple of 'technical support' giving details of how to setup. Their lamentable support stops at 9pm and is based in Egypt (which is fair enough if it was actually open). Basically a totally incompetent provider.I have updated this from 1 star to 3. Having put in two complaints and posted on here they got in touch at work to resolve. However today I just phoned TP Link  who were brilliant in terms of setting up the router. On the Vodafone box things did improve a little but it is poor quality, I could not get our TV's or TP Link to access it at all and the signal was weak / less than poor.I understand the approach of not supporting a third party router - its pretty obvious ship instructions for third party routers if a customer opts for them - even if they need to setup with router company. They should have 24/7 support in day and age and make sure their staff actually are trained on the product/options.",1

I would like to update my review. Since writing my review and spending over an hour speaking to the sales manager and writing a letter and HAVING TO MAIL IT THROUGH THE POST CERTIFIED I received a call from Vodafone and I think the problems have been solved. it was a nightmare but hopefully thanks to the amazing Sales Manager things should be good now.Thank you!!!!,1
"Generally if you call other mobiles in UK within the bundle is cheap ( like I pay10 GBP for 250 min a month + unlimited text and 2 GB data).if you want to call a landline or a line that starts with 02 then they start charge you additional and is not part of the minutes you already paid for. the charge for that call is very high and if you got additional credit like 5 or 10 pounds in your account you can make barely one call as they charge over half pound per min for such calls which is absolutely ridiculous, more importantly, they don't tell you that these calls are not covered by your monthly bundle.However there are solution to that , unfortunately not through Vodafone, I bought JustVoip and through that you can make free calls to number that starts with 02there coverage here in Medway is gooddata speed is good as wellroaming in Europe is very good as its considered as moving in UK",1
"Fairly new customer, had some bad experiences with o2 and 3, so hopeful Vodafone will prove better. Feel it was a bit rogue to hide my line rental, when I was led to believe I would be paying £20 a month all in. Suppose all companies are out for your money, perhaps they will prove to be the best of a bad lot.",1
"Product is good, communication can be better.",1
Really difficult to engage with from a rural location. However once you get through to the right person it's an okay service. They wont use email which is a big down point,1
"One of the best UK providers, been with them over  6 years and have had good experience except when it came to upgrades and price matching its contenders. Today as I write this my number is being ported over to O2 because nobody at Vodafone retentions wanted me or three of my other family members to stay with them. Not saying they did not try to retain us, they tried really poorly.After 6 long years leaving on a bad note is probably thier only negative. Their customer service is ace and beats anyone else out there. Stick to it if you can find pocket friendly options. Service for data and call quality are way better than other providers too.But once again loyalty with them DOES NOT PAY so be prepared.",1
Would be 5 stars but their pricing is high. Love that I can use my phone globally,1
Good:Network works fine.Price for the whole contract.Bad:Technical customer service was poor.Not able to set spending cap on app.Useless additional services switched on by default.,1
"TBH i have been a loyal VF customer for many years but i see none of that loyalty reflected back? I do see new customers getting much better deals than me, which really grates on me and makes it feel VF are taking me for granted...do not!.I am due a 'scheduled' upgrade right now but the deals are in no way rewarding, small data offers show little respect for my prolonged loyalty. My actual contract expire in 10 weeks, it is likely i am  leaving VF and i have already requested my unlock code. Give me a Huawei P20 lite (Blue), 1gb data and whatever mins and texts for a 'valued and well  deserved' loyal customer price p/m.Now balance is mitigated but here it is, to be fair, respect where it's due, coverage has never ever been a concern and having lived in a small village, only VF worked out there, so well done VF.I have encountered staff/service difficulties in-store relating to setting up my partners new VF contract phone, costing us 4 visits to the city centre store to finally have it resolved.Make me feel respected and valued VF?",1
"I'd been with Vodafone as a PAYG customer for many years and wanted a SIM only monthly contract.  Despite Vodafone's best efforts and mine they couldn't match one from Virgin so I asked for a PUC and switched.  Because I was in credit when I left Vodafone I asked for a refund after switching. I went through various levels of Customer Service only to be told it wasn't possible, often for a different reason each time.I'm a great believer in Trustpilot so I initially left a damning review on here.Within a day I was contacted by them and through social media messaging and a few phone calls, a refund was agreed and made.I'm a fair man and give both credit and criticism when due.  Vodafone got it wrong in the first place, but through tenacity and determination, common sense prevailed and Vodafone got it right in the end.",1
"One star is too generous.What an absolute shambles of a company.Called up on the 10th Aug to cancel my existing contract.  Member of the cancellations team enquired as to why I was cancelling - explained I wanted the Note 9 - they offere to do a flexi upgrade on my account and for £79 upfront I'd more or less be on the same contract.  A little bit more expensive a month but yes ok fine.  As a pre-oder bonus I would also receive the handset on the 17th Aug, a week ahead of the official release date.  Great.  I get a confirmatory text explaining these details and the specifics on the new contract and date of delivery.No email comes through and during the week I get in touch through vodafone live chat on no less than four occasions to enquire why my order number isnt coming up on their tracking system.I'm told that pre-orders dont work on the tracking system.I'm told that not to worry sir we can assure you the phone will be delivered on the 17th.  You will get  DPD tracking number. Some examples below:You : ok no problems - just to confirm the delivery date?Sunil : The deliver date 17/Aug/2018Radhika : Thanks a lot for waiting.I have checked the details for you and i can see that you have upgraded your order with the SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9 - 128GB - OCEAN BLUEHowever, as this is pre-ordering will get the handset 1 week before release date which is 24th August 2018, Delivery will be made to your home address on the 17th August 2018Radhika : DPD will message you beforehand with a time slot and will be delivered in the times of 8AM - 6PM.No phone came, better yet - after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes I'm told that no-one knows anything about this pre-order bonus.The vodafone representative acknowledges this and refers me to Complaints.  I call the complaints number and I just dont understand what the functionality of that department is.  They offered no explantion, reason or any kind of remuneration for the mis-selling of this 'offer'.I then called 191 about cancelling my order.  I'm told that I cannot cancel the order as its still 'open'.  I now need to wait until next week to receive the phone (despite it not being dispatched yet) before I can cancel.I am lost for words.An absolute shambles.Update - after contacting the social media team I called 191 to ensure my preorder was in fact cancelled. I spoke with a very helpful chap called Colin who was sympathetic with the situation. He was able to get me a great deal on the phone.  I have updated the rating to 3 stars as at the end of the day I was mis sold, but looking at the average rating I'm clearly not alone with my experience.",1
"We've had mixed experiences with Vodafone. We had a £200 bill rack up on a completed contract and the first time we heard of it was when a debt collector contacted us. Eventually, with alot of investigation Vodafone end they put it down to an Admin error. That aside, when we have had the need to contact them we have had quick service.My advice is use them wisely, if there's a good deal going then snap it up, just make sure your contracts are ""CLOSED"" at the Vodafone end.",1
"Vodafone are great when you are paying them for a contract, but as soon as you ask for something in return, it's no.  I am going away for a year working where I cannot use my contract, so will be paying for it at £24 a month but not using any of the features.Basically vodafone will be getting this money and I won't be using anything in return.  I understand that I have to pay for the phone, and accept this, but I thought they might give me a reduction on my monthly payment as I won't be using any data, minutes or texts.  I need to take my phone to use with a tourist SIM card.",1
"I signed up to a Vodafone plan through mobiles.co.uk because of a cashback offer on a high data allowance. My company also offers an employee discount on 12-mo Vodafone contracts. So I decided to give it a go.Vodafone have the best network in the UK. The Ofcom network coverage maps demonstrate it pretty well, and I did my own independent testing, and Vodafone came out on top in every place I've visited - 79% any coverage during my regular commute. I get fast speeds and general reliability is more stable than O2 and far superior to 3.There are many issues with Vodafone though:1. Some settings simply cannot be changed without getting in touch with customer service. For example, voicemail was completely inaccessible for months and only by ""resetting"" the voicemail was it resolved (not sure why it was not setup correctly in the first place, perhaps as I transferred numbers). Other settings also just show errors when trying to change them such as the age restriction bar.2. When changing limits and settings on the website or app, sometimes it ends up changing other settings unintentionally back to their defaults, or, the setting you actually changed reverts back (as if it never applied in the first place).3. Sometimes when trying to access the website just to get my bills, I'd just get an error saying come back later, which happened for a month - whereas the app was able to make changes without issue.4. If you sign up for a new contract with Vodafone with a new SIM card, even if your old contract has already ended, it takes 30 days to transfer your phone number to the new contract. Whereas moving the number to another provider would have taken at most a couple of days. I've managed to get it down to 7 days through threatening to leave, but this is still unacceptable.5. I previously wanted to leave shortly after my first contract ended, and I asked for my PAC code, and received comms about it many times, but never actually received the code. My online account was also unintentionally deleted so could no longer get to my bills or see my plan.6. When I cancelled a retention plan, the comms said I had to return my phone. The phone that I had actually bought myself and was not part of the contract. This is very misleading and other users could end up believing this.7. My experience of in-store staff is mixed - sometimes they were attentive and sometimes not. Though I don't blame this on the company per se.Overall, I'm very pleased with the coverage and data speed, on the fence about price changes, and not happy about customer service. I would be hesitant to recommend.",1
Customer service is good but u will never get promised broadband speed.,1
"Love the chat feature much easier than calling and listening to hold music constantly.Been with Vodafone for 20 + years and there ""deals"" are no where near as competitive as the new providers.  All they want to do is SELL you more- more date more talk time and every year I call about my contract I ask the same question - what is my ACTUAL usage. I don't want to pay OVER my requirements and with most places with free WIFI and whatsapp who needs huge data packages unless it's for businesses?  My contract gets agreed with a price and no sooner this happens and ""additional % cost"" gets added a few months later - do they think we won't notice.Just wish they'd stop selling my details onto 3rd parties.",1
Customer service not bad... but not great either,1
"I have had a few problems with Vodafone from delivery problems and connection which was frustrating but i have to say how ever annoyed or anary i was going onto a phone call to customer service I found it very hard to remain angry as the level of help and professionalism from the sales, retentions and complaints team was extraordinary they are a credit to the company and I don't think vodafone would be operatingreat without them",1
"it is not even the speed of 2g, the price is good compared to other profile companies",1
"Be careful with the Europe global roaming. This allows you to use your bundle minutes and texts while in Europe, so you could call the UK from France or send texts to the UK from France. However, if you send a text to France from the UK, you will be charged international rate! Even if you take on the option of international saver for an extra £3 or £5 a month, you can then call from the UK to Europe but you will still be charged international rate for sending a text to Europe.... Pretty unfair considering that texts are a lot cheaper to handle than call for the mobile operator.",1
"I have broadband - they're too expensive for mobile plans and would never use a landline. The broadband is good enough for the £21 that I'm paying. I am not sure of its reach, as, in a two bedroom flat, it loses connection in one of the bedrooms - only two walls between the router and room. Very weird. But through only one wall (to the other bedroom), my laptop is well-connected to the WiFi. My phone loses connection sometimes. It's a weird signal, I guess. Their customer service was fine with me, had to talk to them quite a bit to ensure that everything runs smoothly before deciding to take the package. Then when it should've gone live - it didn't, so I phoned them. A fine solution, it was because of my plug in the wall - oh well. But they're good for broadband. Good enough. I've never actually had fast and well-working WiFi, not with Sky (and they have terrible customer service), not with EE, nor with TalkTalk. So I guess Vodafone is good enough.",1
"Could be better. Can't fault the signal and strength of the network. Never had any problems. Been with them for at least 10 years now and trying to get a better deal out of them come upgrade time is like trying to squeeze blood out of a stone. Very reluctant. Unless you tell them you're going to leave instead. Then you might get a slightly better deal. And the range of handsets on offer is very very poor. If you want something other than a Samsung or an Apple, no chance.I went to Carphone Warehouse as I wanted the Google Pixel 2 but had nothing but problems with them. Fair play to Vodafone who have advised me and helped me deal with CW's mess up.",1
Extremely long waits for customer service 40 minutes +0.3 Mbps speed on my Superfast 2 broadband which was guaranteed to be 55MbpsConnected directly to master socket with LAN connection to router.My internet was faster than this 15 years ago!Edit March 2021: Increased star rating as internet speeds have been reliably fast (50Mbps) for well over a year.,1
"This is one of worst singnal in my location. They give 1.4GB per day but we can't use it full. They are smartly remove our signal and save their money. If we was call cus.care they said your connection is good then clear your searched files from your website. This is too waste. I got more angry but what will I do against them, they consider me as a 10 to 11 people only.....",1
"When the 4g wi-fi network is good it's really good however when it's bad and you can't  get online, complaining to vodafone gets you an extra 250mg of data allowance to use in seven days BUT you can't use it because you have no network connection - thanks for nothing vodafone",1
"Very quick to say you haven't paid, even when you have and can prove it. Disappointing response to chat.",1
"Leaving after 3 years - all down to lack of communication. I have a sim only contract which is due to expire next month. I called up this week to renew it for another 12 months and was told I’d be on the exact same contract. Happy enough, I went online straight away to apply my EA discount (30%) only to find it was showing as 15%. Called them back to query this and was told that recent changes have seen the discount cut in half. Why wasn’t I told this to begin with? Tried to haggle with them however they point blank refused to budge on a £17 a month deal (for which I’m currently paying £14). Only a couple of quid a month I know, but why would I want to pay more than what I currently am, especially when I only use about half of my monthly data allowance?!Anyway I asked for my current tariff to be reinstated and gave 30 days notice of leaving them. Got on the blower to EE who offered me the EXACT same deal for £13 a month. No brainier...Vodafone called me back a few days later asking why I was leaving. They then offered me the same deal I’d declined just a few days prior, despite me telling them about EE’s superior offer. No thanks!As if that wasn’t enough, they text me this morning telling me about changes to the EA discount applicable from 4th February... erm hello it’s now 18th February! Perhaps if they’d sent this out earlier then we would’ve avoided this debacle and I may have considered paying the extra.This isn’t the first time Voda have messed me about. I took out broadband and home phone with them 2 years ago, only to be fobbed off and charged more than they promised! Promptly cancelled and took my business elsewhere... EE to the rescue again!",1
"vodafones service on the tube is not v good, unlike ee you cannot connect to the internet, is it just me?",1
"As a mobile phone company they are about as good as it gets (which isn't too marvelous anyway) and their broadband works where Talktalk failed miserably. However... when renewing my contract I was offered free NowTv. It seems though that to use this I need to enter my payment details and then remember to cancel my 'subscription' in 12 months. This is an old technique used to rip people off (Brittania music anyone?). Not impressed at all. Shape up Vodafone! This is sneaky, underhand and not how I expect to be treated as a customer.",1
I've given up trying to solve my problem. They owe me just over £20 due to billing issues and after ringing up several times over the last two months I've lost the will and not going to bother.The call centre staff are friendly but have no knowledge or power to solve anything.EDIT: After seeing this post I was contacted by a UK customer support office who had a lot more technical knowledge than the usual call centre staff and solved the refund instantly.,1
Average customer service. Best network though.,1
Trying to end my contact by phone. Always busy. At lest 40 minute wait. Still unable to get through. Will have to spend an afternoon waiting in the shop at this rate. Poor customer service. Extortionate contracts that never remain the same.,1
I have had many issues with Vodafone over the past year. However my credit check passed successfully with them and not with other providers so I thought I'd go ahead as at least I have a new phone! With this contract I won't be paying by Direct Debit. Instead I will do it manually to ensure that the bills are correct and to ensure that no overcharged amounts are taken from my bank. I agree with the reviews here on Trustpilot and personally I wouldn't have chosen Vodafone a second time. However at least I have a new phone out of it! So I can't really grumble...,1
"It took time to sort out the broadband before it actially worked (days). Part of the problem was the lack of technical knowledge at the call centre and an inability to do anything but follow the computer screen prompts at their end. The gentleman that solved the problem was great but even he was annoyed with the mess.Re the free gift.... the marketing company should be sacked and never used again. There are problems in getting in contact with them as there are a lot of unhappy customers without gifts, in particular a speaker that has now lost a quarter of its value before I've got it. Added to that an inability to communicate the correct information to me I now feel the whole gift thing was a big con.If Vodafone is offering the best deal for you then great. Any gift offered is a bonus if it arrives.",1
Very good signal most of the time but they are more expensive than other networks. I was with them for a while but I then had to change,1
"Average service, slow",1
Vodafone's Internet broadband is a bad choise.Continues failures and lower speed than i had with BT.,1
"Reception ok, but dubious charges on the bill when I went abroad to Spain. Have complained and waiting to hear.",1
"Spoke to agent on live chat reference upgrading my phone, I asked for a good deal as I have been a customer for shy of 10 years.  After minutes of hagling with the agent, a deal was struck, was I happy with it... sure.Order was put through and chat ended.I decided to check Vodafones web page to see how much I'd saved......LOL the same special offer given to me was staring me in the face, apart from the upfront cost of £30. So no special offer for a long serving customer,  I guess my loyalty wasn't really of interest to the agent. Thanks a bunch.",1
"After lots of haggling and lots of misinformation from the call centres in Egypt, they did put me through to someone in the UK and they have given me the best deal I could find, so in that respect i'm very happy. £22 for 40Gb data unlimited txts and mins as well as spotify premium is very reasonable. However getting anything else sorted is an absolute nightmare. My mother switched the account into my name when I was 18, that was 6 years ago now and they are still billing her £4.17 every month for 6 years, on her credit file. But when they search her on the system there is no account in existence with her name to it. it's an absolute joke. So she can't even pay this supposed fee. There call centre staff just have no idea. Therefore I would suggest avoiding vodafone their billing system is an absolute mess.",1
"I have been with Vodafone since 2015, all was well until 2 months ago when they started changing me for using my free data, after wasting hours chatting with them they sorted it out. And all was good, until now, for some reason they charged me double for this and next month. I spoke with them again, even went to a store, in the end thay said it was a glitch in the system and that they have fixed it. I am still waiting for my bill to find out. After my contract ends I don't know what I will do, I am disappointed with all the Asian and Indian people I have to talk with who don't even live in England... 3 stars go for the 1 and a half year of no problems",1
been with them for 11 months now and been good but didn't like how they charge to use phone in europe but three dosnt charge at all which i find really good,1
My husband rang  to upgrade my mobile phone contract as  the account is in his name. The first person he spoke made no effort to make a good deal. So my husband ended the call.He rang back 30 minutes later and got a more interested person who managed to find a deal for no upfront charge and over £8 per month cheap.Ring back if you don't get the deal you like is my advice,1
Been a loyal customer for many years - had many bad experiences but today was good. I felt the gentleman I spoke to was very understanding. Guess it's a little bit of luck who picks up the phone!,1
I have been with Vodafone for years. The network coverage is very good but they are quite expensive and when ever I try to call them the service is not that great,1
"I had to go into my local shop in Basingstoke recently. I was met by someone who turned out to be the manager. His attitude stunk. I would have cancelled my contract and gone elsewhere, it was that bad.In the end i spoke to a young man, (think his name was Jo and he was quite new), who took time to listen to me, helped with the problems I was having and restored my faith in the store. He was fantastic.Because of Jo you've retained a customer. If it had been left to the manager, your have lost me and I'd have made sure I spread the word about appalling attitude.",1
"I have used Vodafone for years, always finding their staff helpful.  However, since moving to a new area the reception on my phone has been poor.  It seems more and more these days other networks give better reception.",1
"Been with Vodafone for over 20 years now , had 5 lines with them and although I have had issues ( some pretty ridiculous to be honest ) they have usually managed to sort me out in the end . Recently had problems ending an iPad contract . They disconnected the wrong line despite several contacts webchat and calls to make sure the error was corrected . They then didn't carry out the reconnection process and it took a call to the uk complaint line to get some decent action the operator was very helpful competent and efficient .the line was reconnected in 30 mins with. Thank you for that Vodafone ,please why can't you provide that service all the time .",1
"Tricked into signing up as the salesperson promised me a discount that didn't materialise.Despite providing a transcript of our conversation I still had to jump through a 100 hoops to get the discount, which I now have.I do have an excellent deal and good coverage so I'm happy with vodafone itself but the customer service experience was a nightmare until finally resolved.",1
