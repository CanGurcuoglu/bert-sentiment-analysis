"4 calls with Customer Services - maybe 90 mins in total - to fix a router VOIP problem following an upgrade in our Fibre contract. 16 days with garbled incoming calls.The third Customer Services agent was the first to properly listen to my narrative, check what had been tried previously, seek more expert input, and do what she promised to do.Would Vodafone please consider a small gesture of compensation for the time, inconvenience, and inability to provide a proper landline service for 16 days?Edit 19 Jan:With reference to Vodafone's generic reply, the landline issue was resolved after 16 days. I can't pursue a rebate of charges, since I don't use fB, X or Instagram. What do you propose?",1
"I purchased an 8 day euroroaming bundle recently on a trip to Italy. Data and texts worked fine, but calls…..no. I could call the uk but could not call any Italian numbers without incurring extra charges. Calls from Italian numbers to my phone didn’t connect. This made life difficult with Italian friends and family and ordering pizza etc etc.",1
"Mobile broadband service (Gigacube). Well, the good thing is I now sometimes have Wi-Fi as being in the countryside makes it difficult to good Wi-Fi, hence the 3 stars. Overall, the signal is patchy. But, during one of the windy days a pylon that gave us signal got damage and our Wi-Fi stopped working. We were without Wi-Fi for 3 weeks! My partner works from home you can imagine the inconvenience this caused having to balance the 1 car between us to drive to and from a library or cafe every day to get Wi-Fi and just about be able to work and at the same time drive to my office as I work there 5 days a week. After 4 phone calls and hours on the phone, I got a refund for some of the days we had no Wi-Fi (10 out of the 21 days). This came to £16.67. What. A. Joke. So stingy it's unreal. To be clear, I pay £50 per month for my Gigacube contract. The people on the phone were nice don't get me wrong. But damn, their slimy policies and inability to fairly treat customers will kill this company. I'll be switching at the first opportunity.",1
"I generally don't have an issue with Vodafone..calls are generally answered quickly and efficiently with politeness..which is fine..HOWEVER...Call handler put me on hold but didn't turn his mic off..to quote what he said..""We have online another complaining White trash Mother Fu**er""...THAT call has been recorded....",1
I ordered a new phone and used the click and collect service... I had a email to say my phone would be ready for me to collect 4th January 2025 - however I had no notification that the phone I had ordered wasn't in stock in the store.. I've tried to find out how long it would be for you to have the phone delivered to the store and how long it would be until my order is ready to collect and haven't been successful... Could anyone help please??,1
"First two visits were generally very positive.  In general, I get good support and service when I go in with any issues.  Today's visit was, sadly, far from satisfactory.  The person I dealt with seemed very uneasy.  The system was down, so I couldn't process or confirm what I had found online.  My salesperson used his own phone and gave me a quote which was around £10 more than my cheapest online quote.  So I did the same process on my phone and came up with my original price.....This visit certainly didn't come up to the standard I'm used to from this store.  I know it can't be helped if the systems are down, but to get quotes that conflict by such a significant amount doesn't exactly encourage a spirit of optimism.....",1
"Vodafone UK's Eltham branch has some friendly and helpful staff, like Mike and Montana. They assist well with data transfers and explaining broadband options, ensuring I felt informed rather than confused. Demi also provided great advice and support for account setup and cancellations. Overall, while the staff is commendable for their service, there's room for improvement in overall experiences.",1
"After a disappointing installation and little help in setting up, via the App and instruction sheet, it's now performing well, with good, consistent speeds.If it carries on like this for a few weeks it'll be up to 4*",1
"Appalling customer service tools. Phone line cuts me off when trying to connect to an advisor; they did call back to be fair but they couldn't provide any help as it was an 'external' call.Online chat they don't answer or it automatically times you out; times out very quickly so you need to keep typing something very frequently (they actually advise you to do that - mad). Utterly useless.Finally got my issue (regarding PAC) thanks to a very helpful advisor called Christine, so that's one positive point to feedback.",1
"The telephone Internet get worse. I am at my home in York City centre and I have no Internet every afternoon and now on a Saturday Sunday very little in the morning  and evening always unstable,  the quality and reliability has drastically reduced in Poole  Dorset too.All the local shop can say is it when the network is very busy.  I have had a new sim card and my phone is a new samsung galaxy...I know many others are commenting too ...the service provided is not fit for purpose.I had no stable Internet until 21.00hrs on saturday all checks have been done just too busy on the network your shop tells me.",1
Ok but constant issue with phone calls dropping and 4/5g connectivity problems. Was with EE before and never had any problems at all. Certainly needs some improvement to make me sign another contract,1
"If you have the benefit of speaking to a UK support team the experience is personable and professional.However the website/app experience is dreadful.The painful experience of attempting to log onto your account is a real put off. Codes, usernames, one off passwords, PIN numbers and I could go on.As for the on line chat Bot, Tobi, it must be the most useless experience and waste of time. Don’t even bother trying to communicate with it, ring the call centre direct.",1
"They are expensive, do not reward long customers, deal with problems badly.After 22 years I am ending my association with Vodafone. I have been charged an inflationary price for sim only and mobile internet which I can save 30 pounds a month by switching. When someone hacked my phone and ran up excessive 0800 calls over my monthly contract, Vodafone dealt with it clumsily, restricting my phone access until they received payment on two separate occasions.No apologies were offered when I complained.",1
"Update!Having posted on Trustpilot about being charged for a phone contract that had been cut off, I had a call the very next day from Vodaphone saying that they would refund my money as clearly there had been a misunderstanding and I shouldn't have been charged. A great result.",1
"I've been with Vodafone since around 2011 when i got my first iphone and my experience with them has genuinely been good altough data signal has been bad this last year, my contract came up for renewal and i wanted to go to a pay as you go, they told me on the phone i couldn't switch and keep my phone number and offered me deals that were too expensive with either too much data or too little so i switched to O2, i now am paying less and i also get 5G ! i never got 5G with Vodafone even though i was paying for it for 2 years, i would only get it if i was in my town or a city. Happy i swicthed after all these years and disappointed Vodafone couldn't help out a loyal customer.",1
"The service I received in store was very direct and didn't have to wait to be seen.The shop assistant that served me seemed initially very uninterested and condensing towards my questioning. I felt almost patronised against because  of asking whwt he odvsiously deemed as silly questions made clear from his eye rolling and huffing. He even kept dropping my bank card on the table instead of handing it back to me as well as the receipt being folded and casually thrown across to me.He clearly picked up on my mood changed in reaction to this and clutched at some sort of small talk which frankly I had lost interest in. I just wanted to get the upgrade sorted and leave the store by this point.I will have to go back to the store in a few months for a device upgrade, but really do not want to be served by this staff member.He did do what was asked of him but I felt rather belittled by him.",1
"We have broadband with Vodafone it I cheap and drops out quite often but generally ok, don't expect the best.",1
"After one month of confusion in which I spent hours on the phone trying to prevent Vodafone from cutting me off, I give credit to their staff for trying to resolve the issue and offering me a generous compensation payment. I won't know till next month whether the issue has finally been sorted out but am keeping my fingers crossed. No problem with the technical side but the administration has been chaotic.",1
"Vodafone Blackburn Town Centre, nice and helpful guys but the system is rubbish. I waited a lot because the system was not processing the info correctly",1
"After 5 calls with various members over the past month, they failed to tell me that I cannot change my number from a pay monthly to a pay monthly.Looks like the company will only reply to 5 star reviews.",1
"Most of the time it works ok, I got a good deal on my top internet speed which is stable most of the time, however can't say much about their app. I put it on a new phone yesterday got it working fine then today I try to sign in again and it wants all my details again like a lost password procedure, I know am retired but I still don't have all the time in the world to be faffing around with sign-in procedures. I've taken the app off its useless. I wanted to chat with someone as my landline is not working, the phone works at my daughter's but not here. The issue is obviously with Vodaphone. Update: Thanks vodaphone I did try that but it still wants me to go through all the sign up procedure again. My landline is now working now anyway.",1
"Let's be clear, the operator in the shop was extremely attentive, several years of experience of the software, knowledgeable & helpful. Clearly the computer systems they are working with are old, cumbersome & slow, which hampers shop staff in handling enquiries & making sales efficiently & speedily.",1
"Well, I'm rather disappointed. I wanted to join Vodafone, but after less than 24 hours, I've canceled my SIM card. The coverage checker and my signal don't match up, and it's the same as my current provider, only twice the price. If they had reduced the price by 5 pounds a month, I would have continued with my 24-month contract, but I'm not paying double the price for a marginally better service! It is great that you offer the 14-day cancellation period, though.",1
"37 minutes to renew broadband contract, like for like.  How inefficient for both Vodafone to have a chat agent tied up for that time, but also poor customers who have to go through the painful process.If I can renew contracts elsewhere with just the click of a few buttons, why does it have to be so onerous with Vodafone ?",1
"Couple of weeks in and unable to make outgoing calls on landline at the moment ? In fairness, complaints are very quickly acted upon but having tried on several occasions to see what the problems is. I changed to Vodafone as they were offering a much cheaper service and faster internet, although I've since found out that the figures quoted are based on cable connection rather than wifi ? who connects with a cable these days ? very misleading but presume other providers do the same ?",1
"I bought a sim only contract. My worst ever experience with any mobile network. It’s 4g network. When I bought it I wasn’t aware that it is 4g. Unable to open bus app, bank app, YouTube and other social media apps. They keep increasing monthly charges. I’m just paying for nothing. Apart from all very poor customer service. Never helped. Thousands customer like me just paying these companies for nothing.",1
"I did not apply for £150 gift card in time because I received a no fault eviction notice and so I was worried about becoming homeless.  So I had to put all my time and attention for months on to finding somewhere to live and moving.  After several calls and speaking to a manager and they did nothing.  Even though I explained this is a lot of money for me as I’m not able to work due to health reasons.Also, I moved home and had a new line put in.  I had to stay with Vodafone because I had a contract.  I was without internet for about 5 days.  The engineer burst my heating water pipe.  After the pipe had been fixed, all the water had to be drained from my heating and then the heating had to go on maximum for an hour.  Then it had to dry out for weeks before the wall was plasterboarded and painted.  It took so much of my time up and took months to be resolved.  I received £3.90 of compensation from Vodafone!  AVOID VODAFONE BROADBAND PLEASE!Update it has since been half resolved.",1
"Decided to change our broadband to full fibre with Vodafone for a ""seamless transfer."". Two lads turned up on the day, on time, layed the cable, drilled the necessary holes and tested it - didn't work. An obstruction in the cabling down the road was diagnosed. We were told a man would arrive the next morning to sort it.Nobody arrived, nobody contacted us. Eventually I rang Vodafone (not easy!) and got through to the installations team. I was told that there was a problem in the cabling (we knew that!) and that someone would call to resolve it on 12 November (13 days later). That we didn't know! No amount of arguing could persuade them to do it earlier; they just blamed City Fibre. I ended the call very frustrated and not a little angry. No contact from them since, no confirmation of the 12 November, no faith in Vodafone. That is a ""seamless transfer"".  MORE - I have added a star as the Trustpilot review galvanized Vodafone into action - we now have broadband up and running. BUT the phone line doesn't work! I have phoned twice, received assurances, even called in a Vodafone shop, but still no telephone. Will contact them again later in the week but very frustrating.",1
"Spent hours trying to cancel my upgraded broadband.Passed from dept to dept and still no further in after hours.To renew or take out the contract was perfect but customer services seem non existent when you need to cancel! very disappointed with Vodafone.  Used to be amazing customer service.Updated, managed to get through to a really helpful advisor who understood and fixed the problem.  Need more guys like this!",1
"This review would have been no stars out of five if it wasn't for Jack and his manager at the Vodafone store in the Grand Arcade, Cambridge. Thank you to them my problem was fixed. Was left feeling frustrated by making a number of calls to 191 after i lost reception in mid December and numerous advisers trying to resolve the issue. Now waiting to learn what kind of compensation Vodafone will offer for being without a service for the best part of half a month.",1
"There seem to be plenty of areas where improvement would definitely help ratings!I recently waited 3 or 4 days for my new SIM to become operational,  due, it seems, to online customer service incompetence. However I would like to thank Sophie at the Basingstoke shop who sorted the problem in minutes :)One major point to address  I feel is the reliance of the customer having access to a 2nd phone to which verification codes can be sent! When you've lost your phone you don't HAVE a phone!!..........  Think about it Vodafone.",1
I have contacted Vodafone through the chat. During the 2h chatting to the Vodafone team about an hour and. Half was about security questions and connecting me to the right team. The other 30 min was just resetting the router and raising a ticket to the appropriate team. 2 weeks without internet and 2 hours lost. If you need to contact them do not use the chat.Update: I called the Vodafone team and my issue was resolved quickly and efficiently.,1
"Generally fine. Vodafone in general are a very difficult company to deal with. Spent four hours today trying to do a very simple task, so had to go into my local store to resolve. Got my issue sorted without too much fuss.",1
"Vodafone took over an hour instore with very helpful staff trying to change a sim only monthly contract to a different level.  I was told there is a problem with Vodafone's online system when a  phone number has previously been pay as you go and it's been a problem for several years.  I left the store without the issue being sorted with the promise of an email follow up when it's done. SORT IT OUT, VODAFONE, YOU'RE A TECH COMPANY.  STOP WASTING CUSTOMERS' TIME.",1
"Chloe who i dealt with was polite and efficient.However her assumed manager ( older male ?) Was less so. My phone screen was faulty and he insisted it was because I had damaged it although he agreed there was not any evidence of damage or any impact mark on the phone ( because there had been none). Seemed more bothered about been sat on his phone at the back of the store then supporting his co workers. Chloe, an asset to your store, him however not",1
"Good mobile coverage, fast, and mobile over WiFi are great, but website and app are dismal - it's like they've never been tested.  Both are confusing to use when managing your account, unintuitive, slow, and regularly crash or throw error messages.  Both are really poor - even trying to renew my contract today, both the app and website are hanging/throwing error messages.  Such a bad impression having these failures in a sales process!",1
"Efficient, helpful and friendly is how I would describe Dan, the guy who served me in Darlington. I requested that he add £10 credit on PAYGO 1 to my phone. He confirmed that I understood how PAYGO 1 works and then credited it to my phone.Later that day I discovered that Vodafone had actually added a bundle which would expire in a months’ time.I contacted Live-chat and the error was corrected by Erik.All's well the ends well.",1
"I moved my house back in November, had many conversations assuring that the old address is disconnected and contract was going to be cancelled. But they continued to charge me for several months, lost chat history. Just unbelievable.._Update_: After almost 3h in a chat, I happened to talk to a person who was able to find the disconnection request for 4th of December. Hopefully this will be sorted out now.",1
Broadband connection ‘engineer’ expected today between 8am and 1pm. No show by 1pm so called Vodafone to be told ‘engineer’ running late but will attend before 6pm. No show by 6pm so further call to Vodafone. Apologetic but offering unsuitable appointments a week hence. Finally offered and accepted a new appointment 2 weeks hence. The point is we had to make all the running with zero communication from Vodafone during the day. Not a good start to our new broadband relationship with Vodafone. On the plus side the Vodafone customer person did their best.,1
"I received great service from Vodafone throughout my 2 years, until my contract came to the end. Vodafone continued to take money from my bank account even though my contract had been cancelled and I had successfully transferred my number to my new provider.What a shame it had to end on such a bad note. And not even an apology from Vodafone when I asked for my money back.I did expect better service from such a reputable company.",1
"I would have given Vodafone more stars had I not moved to Spain, where I found their roaming charges ridiculously expensive. It’s cheaper to pay the basic monthly contract charge, to which I’m tied for two years for no service at all and use a Spanish Sim for my telephone and 4g/5g needs.",1
Been a customer for 2 yrs - broadband and landline. Connection was easy enough to set up and received router promptly. Speeds very consistent and got what I paid for 37mbp/s.However disappointed by mid-contract price rises above inflation. Also upon termination mandatory 30day termination notice despite coming to the end of the contract. For this reason Im unlikely to return - there are better value providers.,1
"Purchased a new Samsung Galaxy mobile on the 7th Dec from Vodafone store in Sunderland , travelled back & forth numerous times to get mobile working without any success . even the Store manager tried but no luck, Finally decided to return the mobile on Fri 29th Dec for a refund , Sales Advisor DONNA asked if she could sort out the problem & HEY PRESTO she did , so DONNA well done , the rest must try harder , Cheers Ann",1
Had Vodafone WiFi provider since 2020 and it was bad at first. Connection is absolutely amazing for a 4 bedroom. Before you get onto me… yes I’ve seen the reviews with customer service.. but when is customer service these days any good? Anyway back to the point. The WiFi signal was outstanding and is quite good for playing stuff online and can have multiple devices using it at once. Had things like PCs PlayStations alexas etc and never had a problem with laggy or slow WiFi with a lot of devices connected to it.Overall if you’re looking for some good WiFi I’d go to Vodafone but I wouldn’t rely on customer service.👍🏻,1
"I have no issue with the home broadband service provided by Vodafone UK. It is pretty reliable and offers the speed advertised. Their broadband hub isn’t good, but I use my own WiFi router & APs behind it.However, if you do need it, their customer service is as bad as it gets. The people you can chat to are perfectly pleasant. But they are under-trained and clearly have minimal system support. The result is that they can achieve nothing to help their customers. It is almost like they are being paid to waste both their time and the customer’s time. I also note that their TOBi pre-chat system is a prize example of ‘Artificial Stupidity’ – carefully designed to waste customer’s time. Even when you manage to connect to a person, TOBI is still waiting to get you. So, for another account security check, it will ask you for the same information again and again, because it only looks at your last reply.",1
"Do your research as vodafone mobile sim only tariff for £10 with 100GB data. It isn't  that good as it don't include ""roam like home."" So you have to pay a minimum of £7 to use your phone in Europe.I will stick with my £8 tariff with o2  with 50GB and 25GB data in Europe include at no extra cost.You would only need 100GB if you want to also use it at home as your broadband.Vodafone need to check what other mobile companies are before coming with something that isn't that good.So make sure you check what is included with your tariff.still Vodafone don't bother looking into it and come with lame excuses as usual, so be careful with Vodafone mobile tariffs as they probably are not a good deal.",1
"Why is it ( I am sure not just Vidafone) difficult to leave these companies.They make it diificult to leave. Threaten of charges which can be heavy.No one contact or tell you to contact during the day , which never have time.I have been with Vodafone for many years . Now paying far too much for the service reception has become bad on mobile data which I know it is noty phone causing this.I am considering Voxi which I believe is part of Vodafone. Nothing so simple.Vodafone - why dont you help your customers.I expect thix womt get to Vodafone but feel better writing this",1
"Bruno was great upgrading my phone to the Iphone 14 + and transferring my information, thank youBruno did do a great job at updating my phone BUT he wrote this review NOT me ! Presumably while he had access to my phone. I am not pleased that while Bruno had access he chose to write his own review without informing me. I would have happily given him a good review but this has somewhat annoyed me and I find it disrespectful.",1
"Jamie bent over backwards to help with my broadband issue.  Although not resolved in store he walked me through instructions to rectify this at home. Very impressed!However, things did not go so well at home. The online chat was tortuous and crashed after an hour - I then started another chat for another half hour only to be told to call a number.  I spoke to a lady in Egypt who was helpful but it took around 3 hours to resolve. I spent a total of 7 hrs trying to get this sorted - not acceptable!",1
"Difficult to ""score"" my experience as the individual who dealt with my query was good, BUT the Vodafone terms and conditions not so good. My contract expired a couple of months ago and I confess I was late in getting new one sorted. As a result I overpaid by 2 months. Not a huge sum, only £28, but they do not refund any overpayments until you cancel the contract. I am happy with the network coverage so wanted to stay and negotiated a sim only deal. Vodafone will hang onto my £28 until I leave them and if I don't, I guess they will keep it? I wonder how many £m's of overpayments they are keeping??",1
I have been a broadband and mobile phone customer for 4 years. Received email clearly showing offer you might like and all information of Broadband upgrade to Vodafone ProII. I clicked the link and followed the instructions. Later I received the confirmation email which surprised me as it's just a renewal of my original Fiber 2 plan at a higher price and discount. I think that email and that way of promotion lacked the transparency and honesty. You don't mislead your customers this way and it would be better to send clear information saying the renewal of your same plan is that. I spoke with the customers service and the acknowledge it but can't do much. They advised to go to the store they might help ?!,1
"Seven+ years with Vodafone and I think I need to move providers ...........I've reached out to fix an issue with logging into MyVodafone app 5 times and not one agent has the technical knowledge to help.Once you [eventually] reach a human they log a ticket with their own backroom staff to reset account which is meant to happen in 2/3 business days but is just lost. No follow up on their behalf. They pass the buck of responsibility from team to team and your left in queues whilst they decide who's responsibility it is to fix the issue.TOBi is the most frustrating and glitchy chatbot everService is getting very expensive again too, annual CPI increases have me looking to giffgaff and lebara for exact same services",1
"Chris the manager was brilliant couldnt fault him at all. However, he was let down by the horrific computer software. For a simple upgrade it took nearly 3 hours. 3 hours i wont be getting back. 3 hours sat in a shop on god awful chairs and no toilets. Couldnt leave or else i would have lost where we were upto. Good staff typically let down by higher management.",1
"Checked before I came to Fort William for signal which said good outdoors, utter rubbish as I haven't had a signal since we arrived. I'm having to use the wife's hot spot on EE . Worst thing I have ever done is to join Vodafone again, so behind the curve with speed and signal. Stay well clear as even at home in the North East it's only average. Home broadband is C#&p as well.",1
"Vodafone customer for 30 years, went to Halifax store today to upgrade / renew.Eventually found a phone / data combo but I have a separate Vodafone data plan they couldn’t cancel in store so I needed to call 191.I now understand why the store wanted me to do this later, but not wanting to sign a new package until I knew the redundant one was definitely cancelled I called 191 while in store.The 191 handler then offered to beat the in-store deal I was offered by 10%, ~£100. As the store didn’t actually have the phone in stock it made no sense not to take up his offer to get the same thing at the same time but for less.I was then asked to leave the Vodafone store… leaving me and my 10 year old son in the cold outside the Vodafone store to have a 15 minute call with the Vodafone call centre to complete my new three year commitment to Vodafone.Is it just me that sees something wrong in the overall Vodafone model there??Also worth noting that during the call the handler believed the shop logged in and cancelled my order on the system while he was completing it, putting us back to square one again and wasting another 5 minutes - but I have no way of knowing if that’s true. If it is it crossed a spiteful line though.I can sort of understand the shop not being happy… but Vodafone’s pricing and distribution model isn’t my fault.I’ll likely be very happy with the phone, I’m ok with the plan charges and my son has a great story to tell at primary school about being kicked out of the store…. The guy on 191 was great too as an individual, but none of this saga is a ringing endorsement for Vodafone overall.",1
"I switched provider after 1 year with Vodafone because they just don't offer good value for money. There are a lot better deals for somebody like me who is just not a heavy data user. Their network was reliable and coverage was always good.However, when trying to renew my deal, the staff at various shops in London just showed very little interest in offering anything competitive, and weren't particularly helpful even though I was an existing customer.",1
"Bought a Vodafone Curve for the dog, it is pretty poor.  If it cannot find a GPS signal it reverts to a random location miles away which looks like someone else's tracker.  The app logs you out and you need to go through getting an SMS, AND an email, THEN ALSO putting in your password, to log back in.  I also cannot get it to show a map history, which is what I bought it for.  Overall it is not very well designed and not recommended.",1
Following a recent 14 day visit to US I found that I had incurred a daily charge for usage when in fact I only made a network call on one day. I queried this with the Taunton branch and it was explained that I needed to be in airplane mode otherwise my phone connecting to a mast would incur a charge?? They advised speaking to Vodafone direct which I did and they said that I should have set my phone to zero charges not airplane mode?? Neither piece of advice appears anywhere on their website as far as I could find. Vodafone are now investigating to verify what I have explained and will therefore I hope refund the amounts charged.,1
Fiber internet is excellent but. Customer service & online access to your account is demand of generation. Their customer service & mobile App is just a glitch. They call it security feature but now a day bank apps work with 1 click then why not vodafone app.,1
"The employees, Maria and Hula, were very kind and helpful. They answered our questions and we successfully managed to get the plan and phone we wanted.However, the service in general was very slow. They said it’s because of the computers loading slowly. If that can be addressed on a company level, that would be great. The whole process took 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete, which is way too long.It would objectively take less time to get a mortgage on a house.",1
Broadband seems to be ok been online with Vodafone since December last year very few outages BUT the Vodafone router is absolutely rubbish we had to buy an extender to reach all our house our previous Talktalk router was fine.Edit 17/4/23 No point in me reaching out as you put it you won't do anything about it I have tried all I was told I would have to upgrade which I don't have the money to do,1
"Initially, this ""WiFi"" enabled system was ribbish, sold as 100 mbps with a guaranteed 50 but struggled to exceed mid 30s at the router and much less throughout the house, excused by ""we dont guarantee WiFi speed"". Constant readings sent to senior CS forwarded to the tech dept resulted, although it took 14 days, a techie working with me to test  everything piece by piece. The results of reseting the router took some hours to work but we then had the speeds expected of this sytsem. SO - dont wright off the system as I did until you've hounded senior CS into getting a techie on the job. Had I settled for the first line of CS / support getting this sorted would not have happened.",1
"I would give them 5 stars if they offered free roaming within Europe. Their competitors offer free roaming with pay as you go bundles purchased, but not Vodafone. I was with them for few years because of great coverage and services, and sadly I decided to leave, after they had stopped offering free roaming. What a shame. They are the best choice if you do not need roaming.",1
The chat online and telephone calls are always a myth. Keep getting transferred to different colleagues as not one person can deal with all queries meaning I am spending hours on each time they put me on hold.,1
"Even out of contract it'll force you to pay for the full final month of connection.""Your 30 day disconnection notice will start from today, 14/08/2023.The number you are disconnecting is xxxYou have a fee of £0.00 to pay left which will come out on your normal billing date in the next 30 days.Your disconnection will be completed 30 days from today, 13/09/2023. Because of this, you will still have to pay for the final month. """,1
"It’s fine unless there’s an issue. They took 2 extra direct debit payments in April, yet to pay them back, cheaper offers for the same deal out there as they’ve decided to cancel my discount I had on, tried charging me £50 when a deal for new customers is £35. Their chat system closes itself when you leave the page on your phone, and their phone system sounds like it’s hanging up on you when you try to get through to them. They don’t care about your loyalty. 12 years I’ve paid them to be my carrier. Bit frustrating that the best they could do was the same deal as everyone else! And there are cheaper out there!Positives is if there isn’t a problem you’re fine, never bad signal or loss of data, always updating towers.",1
"Service is great.  Slow, but great.  Speed of service has nothing to do with employees;  it’s the system they use.  My only issue is gettin an appointment.  You can’t make one on the UK Vodafone number as they don’t have the capability.  You can’t just walk in and get helped because you have to be in the system for them to do so.  The number provided for the store by Vodafone customer service is out of service.  There is no published number for this store and it’s the only one within 90 miles of me.  So, I have to make a an hour and a half round trip just to make an appointment and then do it again once again for my scheduled appointment.  It’s almost like this tech company need to to hire a tech firm to sort out their issues.",1
"I organised the contract for broadband to start on 5th July and received the router a few days before. I contacted customer support on the 5th to check whether an engineer was coming to fit a new master socket since mine doesn't have a microfilter built in. I come to find out that the order failed for some ""technical reasons"" (despite receiving order confirmation emails, the router, setting up the direct debit etc). The contract now starts next week however the activation is simply a virtual button so I struggle to see what part of that has to wait until then. :(",1
"The internet is generally okay, nothing spectacular, but there are 2 main sticking points with them.1. Increasing the price before the contract is even half way through!!2. part of their introductory offer (to help ""soften the blow"" of increased prices AND shove the offer down customers' throats) they are in partnership with Giftcloud.Giftcloud? More like Griefcloud! This company makes promises but delivers nothing but disappointment and frustration. After completing a purchase expecting a gift voucher, all I got was radio silence. Their customer service? Non-existent. It's clear they thrive on deceiving customers and couldn't care less about fulfilling their promises.Calling Giftcloud a scam is too kind; they're outright thieves. They've wasted my time, caused inconvenience, and have the audacity to ignore my attempts to contact them. I demand compensation for their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. Avoid Giftcloud like the plague if you value your sanity and hard-earned money. They're not worth the headache. - I cant believe Vodafone would even consider partnering up with them!!",1
"The service today was excellent first and foremost but the store itself was FREEZING and I was there - as many people are - for over 20 minutes which was essential as i needed my phone sorting but very difficult to manage! It seems ludicrous that the doors can't be closed in baltic weather conditions, the staff must be absolutely freezing all day.",1
"Promised:Min. guaranteed: download 250.00MbpsMin. upload: 68.00MbpsReality:download 83.2Mbpsupload 57.8MbpsWiFi: The worst I had so far. Not even next to the router the mobile phone can run anything!The Wi-Fi of my neighbour next door (I was authorized to test it) is running stronger and faster than my internet using the Ethernet Network Patch Cable.Companies promised just to get you. Then, nobody cares about the service! But if you do not pay, they cut it in a blink of an eye!",1
"Gemima was helpful and gave excellent service. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the store manager, Waqar or assistant Praise who were unhelpful and came across as arrogant",1
"Absolutely unbelievable bad service. My husband took out a new contract with a new phone over two weeks ago. They told him as a reward he would get a payment of £150. He had to go back to collect his phone four days later. Trip one contract, trip two collect phone. Trip three to follow up on reward payment told we needed the receipt. Trip four to take receipt in,  only to be told it will be another 45 days before this is available. We have both had contracts with Vodafone for 5 years. Renewed the first one and about to renew the second one. Its costing more than the reward in travel and inconvenience and now we still have to wait. Would you like for us to pay in 45 days. I bet ""no"".",1
The broadband speed has not improved so far despite being a customer for 8 years… But the prices are steadily going up every year! The company has not invested to improve the broadband!,1
"Although my contract is with Vodafone,  I’ve posted this review for them (3 stars) and 2 stars for City Fibre.During the 13 months as a customer of City Fibre with Vodafone providing the broadband, there have been 2 periods of total loss of service (outages). Recent outage for 4 full days; previously 2 days.Regarding the latter 4 days loss of service:Negatives• Having a family member dependent on broadband for homeworking has meant extra costs, travel elsewhere, and a lot of stress and frustration.• 4 days to fix the problem seems excessive.• Very difficult to get a direct answer regarding the exact cause of the problem – no direct communication with City Fibre permitted.  I was informed by Vodafone that the line was damaged and needed replacing. Knowing the cause [of the damage] is important in assessing if this might be a recurring event.• Vodafone has limitations on Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme, i.e. no payments for the first 48 hours of loss of service.• Vodafone appear overly reliant on City Fibre with little influence regarding obtaining detailed communication, such as in this situation.• City Fibre’s website claims of a reliable and consistent service, is debatable. It is a subjective experience, and mine has been mixed; it has been made worse by no clear explanation of the cause of the disruption.Positives:• Vodafone did what it could in terms of communication, which was generally good and respectful, but ultimately they were reliant on information from City Fibre.• Vodafone has signed up to Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme.• When the broadband is running, it is generally working well.It seems to me some things happen that are outside anybody’s control, as may be the case in these outages. This doesn’t help in the frustration and disruption caused to those that rely on the service. However, a quicker fix of the problem and some clearer communication would certainly have helped.",1
"Although I like Vodafone, I was VERY disappointed that it charged me a £5 late fee when I had no warning from them that the DDEB had been reversed. Literally had no idea. A nice email would have sufficed with a warning but nothing.",1
"Vodafone, great deals but terrible service on resolving an account sync issue with the app and broadband quality.I had a device plan with the Vodafone for phone and broadband. unfortunately due to no-fault of my own the app wouldn’t work with my log in details.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was salvina I have probably spelt that wrongI called multiple times but spoke to a different person every time over a 2 week period.After spending the best part of 2 hours on the phoneThey were still unable to sort out my app issues with my account.Before I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to get the issue resolved. I’m not sure if she was aware of the app issues from previous customers?The other issue was to do with the intermittent signal of the broadband cutting in and out. This was detrimental to my working day at home. It would cut out on Microsoft teams around 4/5 times a day! Very frustrating!The outcome from all this was that I ended up switching both phone device and broadband to EE.This wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome and overall experience would be a lie hence the move.",1
I renewed my contract over six months ago and still can't see my usage or bills. Customer Service is a waste of time and get ghosted by their engineers email address. The app is not fit for purpose either!,1
Why is it impossible to log into Vodafone. Impossible to check speed of broadband or anything else.Well. Have tried four times to login with new passwords Vodafone has just texted. NONE OF THEM WORK! Surprise SURPRISE!,1
"I considered leaving Vodafone today, after several years.  They just increased my monthly fee by 25%.  I spent an hour and a half online with their Customer support team.They offered me Fibre 2 for £25 a month. If I was a new customer I would get it for £20.63 a month. Vodafone are poor to existing customers. It really makes you want to leave.",1
"5 Star for the actual service1 star for every time I try to access the app out of hours it's offline or unavailable. I maybe use the app once a month, and every time its when I need something urgently. How can such a large company not have a clustered enviropment so it's always up.",1
"I ordered a product from Vodafone on Saturday, choosing the ""collect from store"" option, as it promised I could collect it the next day. By Sunday, it wasn’t ready, nor on Monday. I contacted live chat on Tuesday and the first agent said the order had arrived at the store on Monday at 2:58 pm, but I hadn’t received any notification. I asked if I could pick it up, only to be told I had to wait for a notification.When I questioned this, I was passed to another agent who contradicted the first, claiming the order hadn’t arrived but was ""dispatched."" They couldn’t explain why their colleague said it was there, just kept repeating that I had to wait another 48 hours! This would be Thursday when it was originally promised for Sunday. They’ve taken my money, and no one can give a straight answer as to why it wasn't ready on time, or when it will be. All I get is ""wait 48 hours."" I needed it urgently, and the only reason I chose Vodafone was because they promised next-day collection. Absolutely awful service!Checking on the website for a fresh order (exactly the same phone) it says collect today. So if a fresh order for the same phone can be collected today then why can't I collect my order that I placed pm Saturday, now?Update: While the online support was terrible and gave me the runaround, I went into the store, and the staff were excellent. They sorted everything out quickly and efficiently. If only the online service was as good as the in-store experience!",1
"I upgraded to full fibre a couple of months ago, it was a great mistake!! The connection is unreliable, my signal is constantly dropping of. The very reason to upgrade was to have a strong connection while I work from home. My meetings constantly cut out, the signal strength cannot take a simple Teams screen sharing. There is also no way of getting support: i am directed back to signal check test by all sorts of bot chats where i am told that everything is fine with my service. Then when i go through the suggested steps proving that the problem is still outstanding the chat button conveniently does not work. There is no email address and the phone line is so busy that i cannot wait out while i also try working (on 4G!! as I have no reliable home broadband). I am locked in a 24 months contract from which I desperately want to get out of.EDIT: I managed to speak with CS, and they were very helpful so I am changing my rating. Only to 3 because I don't know yet if my drop outs will persist.",1

"New broadband connection installed by cityfibre (glasgow) on behalf of vodaphone, on 1st March 2024. It took 4 days to activate my account, and did not work for further 10 days. After 2 further fault finding visits by city fibre engineers to identify & fix the problem - it was faulty cable coming into the house - there are not many things that can go wrong so is it really difficult to identify and fix a fault ?. I also had at least 3 calls from vodaphone offshore rebooting my router and connection box in the house. I was told by vodaphone, the delayed activation and loss of service, I would automatically receive compensation, which i did not.I chased 2 months later and having got through to vodaphone support in India who were clueless and then to vodaphone in Egypt, I got someone to raise  tickets for delayed activation (4 days) and loss of service (10 days). I received the compensation for the delayed activation but not the delayed service , £70+ is still outstanding. To be fair, all working fine since it was fixed.",1
"I should probably do 2 reviews for this.  Vodafone would score 1 star but Harvey, the assistant manager in Winchester would score 5 stars.I have had a billing problem with Vodafone and despite hours trying to speak to 191 - when I eventually get through, they either can't help and just cut me off or promise to cal back and don't - I got absolutely nowhere.  I went into Vodafone in Winchester where the manager Alexei tried to help.  He discovered problems with the set up of my account going back years, spoke to Vodafone who again promised to get back within a week.  They didn't and next thing I'm receiving threatening messages saying my line will be disconnected and my number removed.I again went into Winchester Vodafone and was lucky enough to be seen by Harvey.  The first person who sat there calmly saying I will sort this for you.  Not only is he a whizz on the system, keeping on and on at it trying to find a solution, but is utterly charming with it.Harvey is now on the case checking everything is sorted and has promised to phone back with an update.  Vodafone - do everything you can to keep Harvey.  If it wasn't for him I would now be transferring our 5 numbers with you after being with you for over 25 years.  Thank you Harvey!",1
"Reputable, but old-school creepy. Hard sell marketing and ask way too much information on sign up. No pay by credit card.",1
My device plan hasn’t been paid because Vodafone havnt been taking any payments they kept telling me it’s because of my bank and my bank told me it’s Vodafone that keeps rejecting it. I have been trying to get this sorted since September and they wouldn’t help me and now they have given me to the debt collectors agency. I talked to Adele today and she wasn’t really helping either only said either I pay full amount or wait for the debt collectors to contact me. All I want is to set up a direct debit but they won’t allow it which just doesn’t make sense. I even offered to pay more than I’m meant to today and they wouldn’t let me. Before also someone was meant to contact me and they didn’t and when I talked to debt collectors they told me that the account is with Vodafone. It’s a big mess! Vodafone do not know what they are saying and I am really leaning to switch providers after this bill is paid because Vodafone are not helpful and I keep having problems with them . I have been a customers for over 10 years and they won’t even try helping me.,1
Voicemail gets locked you if you enter wrong pin one time. I've only tried from abroad so may work differently from UK. You then need to call a number where nobody's picking up the phone. So it's impossible to get access to voicemail...,1
"Update on my experience on 11th September.I was so disappointed in the lack of interest in my not receiving calls/no network inside my house, I called again to make a complaint.  I was put through to a gentleman called Abdul.  He listened, spoke with a manager and asked that I hold on while tests were being run.  He said if the call was terminated, he would call back.  It was, and he did.  He asked me to turn off my internet and try to make calls from different areas in my house and he would call back in 1 hour to see how I got on.  I cannot believe it worked.  Every room I made a call to my landline and I had no problems.  I started again, this time with my internet on, and after a little blip in one area of the house, the rest worked.  Abdul called back and advised he would call again on the 12th to check everything was still ok.  Really pleased it worked, so if anyone has a problem, maybe just go straight to complaints.  Everything is still ok, but he never called back on 12th.  If he had it would have been a 5 star review.",1
they have not bad phone sigal none in my village of corcce they have good vale contracts for my existing pone talk mobile but you have to ask for th cheaper other wise they just say £15 is the ceepeast when you go i instore  when they relly do one for £7,1
"Great, Vodafone is starting to turn off their 3g signal. What chance do most people have as their 4&5g is garbageMay as well go back to 2 tin cans and a piece of string if you are stuck on this network. Worst decision I ever made to come to this 3rd world company.Broadband is poor as well.I appreciate I get unlimited data but the speed is dire, most of the time it takes 30 second's to load a news page.Used to be on EE which was great and never had any issues, with Vodafone there is 4 dead spots on my way home from work along the A19 which sometimes causes me to reboot my phone to reconnect to 5hr network. to be honest it may also be partially due to the dire Pixel 6 phone as well. Either way I'm trying to get out of both contracts asap.",1
Can’t say I’m overly impressed after having very slow Internet for over five days their response is not adequate.,1
I bought a phone from Vodafone shop in Doncaster a week ago and paid £49 for the phone but I was walking out and on the stand it was priced at £39 does Vodafone no it's against the consumer rights law to over charges I would go back to the shop but the manager doesn't have any powers to refund I would send a letter but they never respond I sent a letter to the CEO 2 weeks ago about something else I'm still waiting for a response so I will just do a charge back to my card so please contact me Vodafone and it was missing the ear plugs for the phone and the charger you can message me here I have also texted your retail operation's manager Rebecca hessey on her mobile number,1
"I had ordered a mobile hotspot over the phone - took three hours and two days to get it all confirmed. My order tracker said I'd receive it the next day but I didn't and the day after, it said my order has been cancelled (!?) no alerts - i went to check my tracking updates! COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED BY DPD - POOR SERVICE FOR SURE AND THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO CONTACT THEM AT ALL!I called back Vodafone and the person told me they can't tell me why it was cancelled but said it happened at 4am ?!? I asked for a click and collect instead of delivery and they said they couldn't do that for me and asked me to replace my order and wait for 3 more days.I lost hope but I called back an hour later and got to speak with Sharu, who went through all my details with me calmly and was very empathetic all throughout the call. He was able to look into click and collect for me and had me stay on the phone for about 15 mins and got my order placed and my device ready for collection.",1
Very poor signal for calls and data in pevensey bay for me inside and out. I have spoken to their people many times and been advised to to the same things to try and rectify over and over again. I now manage to make calls over WiFi(indoors) but struggle to get two bars. I even boight a second phone to check mine was ok and had the same issue. Would not recommend them in this area. Also you would think they would keep a record of previous calls and advice so you don't have to go over the same ground every single time. Also I Don not have any media accounts so cannot conduct responses that way. PS I used my phone in London over weekend and it worked fine.,1
I was with vodafone for years.Most of the network providers monthly contract included free EU roaming. But vodafone charged £2.25 a day on top of monthly charges.Also price increases twice within a year.,1
"I’ve had a Vodafone contract for well over 10 years, probably close to 15 years. For the vast majority of time it’s been as any network should be in terms of network coverage. At any contract upgrade time I’ve always felt somewhat valued and had some discounts added for a new phone or if going on to a sim only plan temporarily I found it was a good deal. However this time I was offered a really poor sim only deal, no offers of discounts and no movement in price. I told the lady on the phone that I can see deals half the price online on Vodafone networks, why can’t you do the same? The answer was it was a 3rd party contract, now if I can get a better deal by going to a 3rd party why an earth would I want to go direct to Vodafone. Absolutely ridiculous! Since that last conversation and have my PAC code sent I have had no contact from customer retentions which means my 10-15 years of business had no value or the Vodafone don’t care about existing customers and are happy for them to leave. So after many, many years of using Vodafone I have switched to 3 network. I gave 3 stars as the network coverage is decent, customer services is usually good to deal with but this last interaction was enough for me to give 1 star but felt that it wouldn’t be a clear picture of the last 10+ years.",1
I spoke today with jay from customer office ! I lost a lot of time explaining what I want but the idi run away and not come back. I dont understand why Vodafone paying idio like him ! I just need a new contract. Just to give money to Vodafone !,1
"Signed up for fibre broadband and it wan't made clear how much disruption/ ugly wiring and ugly boxes would be involved outside and inside the house- plus I need to get a extra socket sited ( at my expense) so router and fibre box can both be plugged in.They have to be next to each other unless the householder organises and installs their own longer ethernet cable between the two.   None of this was explained by Vodaphone. City Fibre who did the installation were informative and helpful but pressure was applied by comments like "" copper lines are being phased out so it will have to be done at some time"". Ultimately I now have an unsightly brown box on the outside of the house  and an ugly set up on the wall inside with a large  freestanding white router in a situation that is not what I wanted but the alternative was running cables along the hall round 2 doors, across the stairs,through a doorway, along a wall, and round another door. I will also need to plug the landline phone into the new router which is not where I want my phone. Plus have just realised phone has a plug as it has an answer machine is I can't actually use it any more Didn't think of that one and no one explained it in advance. Very dissatisfied with outcome of switching to full fibre.PS trying to get through on phone is a nightmare- clearly set up to prevent every obstacle to speaking to a human being, including demanding aPIN which I have not been given",1
"Had rollercoaster rides when 7 days remaining in contract to finish. Wanted to retain the spending in control. Offer was to downgrade the package. Agreed and someone made it happen. Then it was cancelled and i was out of old contract by the time. Everytime i talk to them they pit new order and it remain open ... never activated and one brilliant advisor has just sorted it and my activation of new plan is now planned after x'mas.I have got nothing but anxiety and worry for piling up current bills and future bill was going to be double than what it could be. Also they have added unusual charge of ""purchase fees"" worth £16  in my next bill. Which was never been mentioned by any one, even though i mention to advisors. Billing related complaint has been raised but they never gave me answer about that fees and some explanation of future bill can be only found when it is generated.So i have no choice to wait till then and raise it again if not removed from bill. Average time of call with them was never been less than 90 minutes which do not uphold Vodafone reputation i have been praising for.Hope as promised new contract takes place. Like other providers are having multiple stars from trustpilot, Vodafone should do all for their loyal customers. I felt like i was and i am badly letdown by Vodafone till now.",1
Very difficult to deal with sorting out a direct debit issue.  Once my contract up up I’ll I think twice about renewal this time around.,1

I have just jumped ship with my mobile phone package to Vodafone from O2 after too many years to mention the mobile service is fantastic I sometimes even get 5G whereas I was lucky to even get 4G with O2.Now for the BUT I swapped over from BT WiFi and phone on the 17th  I’ve now been in the garden a few times and where I picked up broadband with BT in the garden? The signal had dropped out completely on Vodafone’s new 6E router. We also tried it within the property to find the broadband drops out in the bedroom furthest away. We had signal throughout the property and the hub is in exactly the same place as the BT 6 hub was. I called Vodafone on Tuesday and spoke with a lovely lady who was going to send out one booster to begin with too see how we got on with just one. She had to put us on hold but came back and said our router was the new 6E and the booster she was going to get sent out would not be compatible. But she said that the broadband guys said I would have to upgrade my package. I can’t understand why a more advanced router needs a booster in comparison to the BT router and also I cannot understand that one minute they was going to send out a booster then the next NO I would have to pay more a month or still had time to return to BT. Being unable to walk and in a wheelchair and on Oxygen since contracting COVID I cannot go through having to rely on people to set up everything for me I find that embarrassing.,1
"Would you think buying an inexpensive pay-as-you-go phone would take 10 hours!?  I certainly didn’t think so, until I had to interact with Vodaphone.First, I stopped by the store looking to purchase a certain phone SEVEN times.  Each time, the phone was out of stock.  Each time, I got different information about what the procedure was and what information I would need.  What the sales people I saw FORGOT to mention was that I could just go online and get one!  They incorrectly said activation could only be done in store.  Instead, they kept on telling me to come back in the next day, and the next, and the next.  I came back, waited in line, left, came back, repeat.  Seven times.  On visit seven, one man finally told me I could just buy the phone online.  By that time, I needed the phone the next morning.  (I had spent over a week at this already).  Then, they gave me the wrong information about the online purchase options.  I ended up speaking with someone via chat, and indeed, the purchase options I had been asking about were not possible online given my now urgent timeline.  So, back to the store, for a 30 minute wait at 10am all for a £30 back up phone!  What an unpleasant experience.",1
"The Openreach engineer arrived & got the fiber optic broadband line working, but no Internet. He said he suspected the router wasn't compatible & told me they won't return unless Vodafone issue a new one. I call Vodafone (great this non-joined-up service) and am refused a new router. Call center guy in India tries to ridicule the Openreach guy's findings, before moving on to patronise me and my 'confusion' with the tech (I hold advanced degrees & a Doctorate in Computer Science). Finally, told activation can take up 'til midnight to happen. Midnight arrives, sails by, nothing is activated. My landline phone doesn't work anymore either. The Openreach guy suspects the Vodafone router, but at this point I'm pretty sure it's Vodafone themselves who haven't got off their backsides to activate it. So much stress. They didn't even send the cable they were supposed to send to connect the Openreach box to my router (I had to buy one from a neighbour). Nor did they send the adaptor for my landline, so I'm cut off.I call Vodafone again the next day and speak to 'Marion', who is surely Vodafone's Star helpline person! She activated the line during our (long) call. She was helpful, knowledgeable, easy to talk to and a pleasure of a human being to deal with. She got everything working. Then she put in an order for the missing phone adaptor. Just perfect.It's 5 stars for Marion but 1 star for the company, so I'm averaging it out to 3 stars, because of the stress and because it was left up to me to chase this up with multiple long phone calls, rather than receiving a ready and working service, or I'd still be cut off now.",1
Chloe was great. Very friendly and personable. However finding opening hours or contacting the store is impossible.,1
"I signed up for 24 months contract. The price went up every April.What's the point securing a contract?Started with £16.00 contract just under 2 years ago and now paying £22.60, not fair !",1
"Vodafone currently supply our home broadband - I believe many of the issues with broadband stem from BT OpenReach one way or another, but Vodafone is a big enough company in it's own right to take some responsibility/not be bullied too much.Set up was a bit of a shambles - told the line needed installing even though the new-build house already had an active fibre connection with lights on(!) Waited an extra month or so just for a guy from OpenReach to come in and say 'yup that's fine' and leave.Connection is ok, has been a little flaky sometimes but generally fine for daily work and evening media streaming. On the occasion it drops though, router can take a very long time to regain a lost connection. Router is mediocre and app control is terrible... if you ever manage to set it up to your phone it chucks you out permanently at some point, and to reconnect the app you need to reset the router completely (even that didn't always work). Gave up on it.Again - OpenReach and many customer-facing telecom suppliers are doing it, but mid-contract, (over) inflationary rises in price is a dodgy practice in my eyes, however many companies there are that do it. If I sign up to a £30, 24 month contract I should be paying £30 in month 23, not ~£40. Else don't call it a contract - let customers leave whenever you change the terms (price).In all, absolutely no reason to stay at end of contract so will look to ditch and switch - as many services force you to nowadays - unless you want to sit paying more than you need to for being loyal/'lazy'.",1
"Popped in to Vodafone MerryHill to get some information on switching networks. Gup was brilliant and helped me choose the best contract for me, and options to transfer the family. Transfer happened today with no issues and already enjoying better coverage.Heading back soon to transfer the rest of my contracts now as it was so easy.Thanks Gup and the Vodafone Team.Updated 23rd April 2024Further to my initial positive review, I have had some issues with the transfer of the other numbers. Firstly, Vodafone have a restriction on all new customers to 2 connections to the contract. I have been advise by the credit team this is standard and you need three complete months billed so my initial discussion to move over 4 contracts would never have gone through. Which brings me on to the second issue, all of this is done by the credit team and rather than simply advising on the restriction, all communication’s suggest it’s a credit issue….. This stressed me out massively for 48 hours thinking there was something wrong with my credit score (which there wasn’t) until I finally got an answer, but this was only on the back of a “credit appeal” where the Vodafone rep advise on the 2 line limit…Vodafone really need to firstly advise on the 2 line limit, and then secondly be clear that it’s not a credit issue. For reference my credit score was 930 out of 1000 so the 2 line limit (sim only too) was clearly not related to my score….Be mindful if you have multiple contracts you are looking to switch…..",1

"I've been with voda for many years . Over that time I've varied my plan according to business and social needs and its worked well. Staff you contact are usually very helpful and their customer service system works well. Travelling the world their data and telephony connections were usually reliable and high quality.However when it comes to the hard core subject of cash they let themselves down very badly in several areas .Firstly they were very fast to remove automatic covered  roaming post brexit but even before that they were clamping down and becoming inflexible. They introduced a system whereby if you were out of the uk got a certain time your  roaming cost you extra even on an inclusive plan. It was a complicated calculation that they got wrong and started charging me a month early and would not back down for quite some time and did so just before the regulator was about to step in.We then move onto in plan price rises . Fair enough up the cost by the RPI , though it is a bit of a money gtab, but then to add a further 3 point something percent on for ""network investment"" ?? Surely ongoing investment is par to operating and development strategy and accommodated within the overall business plan ?Someone somewhere is being greedy and then shoots themselves in the foot by posting massive profits .To put all of that in context I have an EU plan too . Unlimited texts and sms . 8gb of data ( chosen by me) with EU and UK roaming . All for €9.99 with excellent service. Voda can't or won't  come anywhere near that.Update : whilst voda prices are on the up again my provider has put me on unlimited everything for the equivalent of Uk £10, still with roamimg. Voda are poor value.Goodbye voda.",1
"Vodafone are looking like they are doing all they can to counter what is presently taking place on the ground in the personal telecoms and media industry to all of their customers.I say this from the position of being a victim to the Three iPhone scam and I now realize that once they have scammed you that's when you look for somewhere to run to in my case it's Vodafone.No matter what the companies using the existing infrastructure try to do the engineers are wagging the dog now.When they come to switch you up you expect them to leave you with the same switches and cable as you always had but that's not what happens as far as I can tell they change your switch to a single slower Openreach Master Socket 5C not 5gz, face plate and there is no filter in the Vodafone Router box it's been removed in transit.So now I want to know where are my extra pairs now that I'm reduced to a single socket switch and one of my three pairs in the cable, with no filter, I'm setup without my knowledge or permission for sharing something I suggest you never doI'm paying extra for the privacy and the speed and to my way of thinking I'm getting neither the entire set up is to reduce speed to 3gz not 4 or 5gz.I want my speed back or come and remove your switches and replace my dual Openreach switch that was originally there.Who is personally monitoring our network and slowing us down.More to the point, why are we being monitored and by whom.Paranoid, you better be, if you're not a little skeptical in the UK these days then you're in a far worse position than I.",1

"**Customer Review:**I have been a witness to a very unruly and rude gentleman by name David George who is wasting everyone’s time and picking on the staff unnecessary and exhibits rude behavior and creates disturbances, demonstrating a lack of interest in Vodafone's services. This individual has a pattern of targeting staff members, leading to an uncomfortable and disruptive environment. Such customers should be blacklisted and never allowed to step in the store.",1
Where to start. Communication is absolutely terrible whenever I've faced any issues.My latest one being that I called and asked if the contract could be put in my own name (it's in my ex husbands but it's my phone/internet service) He is using it as a form of control and manipulation and I told them that. I begged them to swap it over and they told me they can't help me.I then asked if it could go into my mums name who is already a Vodafone customer. Bizarrely they said this was fine. I had to call my mum and tell her to call them and do the same with my ex. I had to act as this go between multiple times. It took 3 days of calls to finally get to a place where they said it would be done then we heard nothing.I called them after 3 days to be told the information had been lost and we'd have to go through it all again. My ex then refused.I had to flee my ex for domestic violence so for him to have this last piece of control over me is awful. Every time we have a row he says he'll cut my phone/Internet off.Yet Vodafone won't help me. I'm trapped until Aug next year.I certainly won't be going with this company again once the contract ends.,1
"Review for broadband set up. Switched from BT, only because of cost. Set up was great and can’t fault CityFibre at all, respectful, quick, clean installation and the supply is all good, I have no disappointment with regards to any of this. However when taking out the contract online I was informed that I do not need to do anything with regards to cancellation of my current provider, BT, and that Vodafone will inform them directly. After all was set up I contacted BT to inform them I would be cancelling my DD payments and was told they they were not informed. After a lengthy call to Vodafone I now have to take myself to one of their shop once I have proof of last payment to BT and the email showing where it says I didn’t need to do anything (this of course being an automatically generated email and likely to be what they send out all the time) and once showing them this they will refund me what I have paid to BT due to Vodafone not cancelling on my behalf. Being self employed and working six days a week I probably won’t have time to do this so I’m very disappointed by this situation. Such a shame for a simple task that I was informed they would do, which I could have as easily done had they just said to call BT and cancel I’m now going to be out of pocket….. A very disappointing start ☹️☹️☹️",1
"Had to wait quite a while to be seen (not staffs fault just busy and three staff on)When serverd Tom was very good,pleasent and got me a good deal.I wanted to cancel my tablet I no longer use but had to do it online would of been better to be able to do it in the shop. Again not the fault of the staff in the shop.",1
"My third time on here about this company. I tried to communicate with the Social Media Team through my partners FB Messenger account about my previously reviewed dismal experience. After numerous to and fros was I informed that (a) because I'm not on my own FB/Twitter and (b) I don't have a Vodafone sim card (I was supposed to get one for the back up dongle with both the first and second router they sent but never did), nor a Vodafone mobile number, they couldn't verify my account. Then I got this via Trustpilot:Hi Howard,After reading your previous review, I can understand your frustration. It's not good to hear the experience you're having.We do need to take your account details securely, so that we can then help further.Please get in touch with our WiFi Xperts on 08080 034 515. We've also a really useful help center that will help to run live tests on your line here: (link not permitted in reviews)Thanks,Vodafone Social Media TeamI didn't have that number so called and luckily a Customer Service agent named Huda (I asked her to spell it) dealt with the whole thing in about 40 minutes. Apparently the original agent was wrong and I can revert to my original package at the original price. It will take up to 24 hours and all will be sorted.The 3 Stars are for the efforts of Huda, a very friendly, polite and sympathetic lady who gave the impression she really wanted to help. I just hope she's supported by the upgrade team (she said they're sorting it out).So the blood pressure medication will stay in the cupboard for the time being. Although I still have no sim in my backup dongle.Watch this space !",1

"Called Vodaphone Customer Service this afternoon, to give 30 days notice of my wish to cancel my Home Broadband Account (moving home and will need to utilise another provider).  Customer Service could not action my request as they are undergoing ""technical"" updates, so none of their systems are working apparently!  Have been instructed to phone back in 7 days, where upon my 30 day notice will start (so I am paying for an extra 1 weeks service that I do not want)  This cannot be fair???  Welcome Vodaphone's response to this :-                                                           Visited a branch (Northallerton) to sort and the team where great, pointing me in the right direction and finally managed to speak to a human in the Retentions team today, who was really efficient and has sorted out my issue:- Thank You.

"Unfortunately I have to knock two stars off .I entered the shop to ask information about sim packets, while my son was checking the new iphone. The information given was very  useful and detailed.When I was about to go my minor mentioned me he took photos of himself, and was trying to erase them. Unfortunately it was not possible as the delete button on the iphone's screen was covered by the metallic frame that holds the phone in place. We tried to push it nevertheless but we weren't that successful. I politely asked a member of staff to help saying that my son took photos, could we please erase them. He tried to push  the delete button also unsuccessfully, due to the metallic frame blocking access. What I found very annoying is that instead of him removing the metallic frame and deleting the photos, he said to me in an apathetic way (at least in my understanding)  that I myself have  to push the delete button eitherway to delete the photos. This is of course understandable, but what about the metallic frame blocking the access to the delete button?? In conclusion we managed to delete the photos by squeezing our fingers in between the phone's screen and the protective metallic frame that holds the phone. Of course mostly my son as he had smaller fingers, and yes it was painful.I understand that I should probably supervise my son more, but such reaction I didn't expect. It makes me feel concerned about how the specific shop or the specific member of staff deals with GDPR issued such as this.So if you visit the specific shop and try the phones' front camera making selfie, make sure that you are ok to leave your photo stored in that device, cause it will be unlikely for you to delete it, at least without hurting yourselves...",1

"When I ordered the board band service I requested that the old phone number to be ported. It is vital in my case as my wife suffers from poor health. The phone line was the contact between us and doctors,Hospitals and elderly relatives. I ordered nearly two months in advance giving them ample time to set up as l required. The first time I was aware there was no connection was when a relative tried to contact us. I range customer services who stated it would take up to a10 working days. I told them that this was not acceptable for reasons stated. After 4 days  I rang and asked if calls could be redirected until the switch over was complete. The operator tried to help but could not achieve the results needed. I told the operator I was not happy and asked to speak to his manager. The manager could not even give me the time of day. Not impressed with the level of customer services. I'm beginning to think that I made a mistake in my choice. It brings into question why am I paying for a land line that is useless!!Yesterday 1th I spent what I can only call a merry-go - round for 1 hour Trying to resolve this situation. I was told the number would be ported by 3 pm today. 3pm came and went. Having spoken to 2 operators today,  the earliest they could port was the 21st. The operator  on the last call would have been better using two cans and a length of string. The line kept breaking up so could  ot understand what he was saying. I had to request him to sms the details. For a phone company I find that difficult to get my head round. I did manage to get his number in the sms.  I will be talking to them again, is the way I see it at the moment. PROVE ME WRONG !!!As of today the 22nd the line still has not been ported.it should have been competed  yesterday. We were not told on installation that we had a new number and didn't find out that until the 6th October. I reported to customer services. I was given assurances, promises and told that it would be put right ASAP.  THE COMPANY POLICY SÈEMS TO BE FOB THEM OFF  MAKE PROMISES GIVE ASSURANCES. THE WILL GEY FED UP AND GO AWAY. I informed them that I was not satisfied with their services and told them that I wouldBe sending a letter to Margherita Della Valle in due course. Again I'm still paying for a landline with a number nobody like doctors know.",1
"The broadband service itself is good, we've had two years of reliable internet, the 4G backup does fail quite frequently but fortunately never at the same time as the broadband so we don't end up disconnected. My bug bear has come at renewal time, I was given my upgrade options which were reasonable but I found a better deal elsewhere. When I tried to cancel I was told I could only do so through an online chat or phone.When I spoke to someone on the chat, in spite of providing my account number and personal information as asked, I was asked a further security question (a pin number) which I advised I had never set up so couldn't provide but would happily answer other security questions. After answering several (correctly) I was told I couldn't be spoken to further because I had failed security and I would need to go into store with two forms of ID.I went into store, waited 20 minutes to be spoken to, to be told they can't cancel my contract in store, I would need to phone their customer service from the store so the store assistant could verify my identity which he didn't do before starting to call them. He then asked if I was leaving to go to another provider and advised, I didn't need to cancel at all, the new provider would sort it out so don't waste my time calling.As it is, by the time I'd got this all sorted out, I'd missed the deal from another company so I've ended up upgrading and staying put but what made me laugh is that to upgrade, absolutely no security required whatsoever because I can do it through my account.I fully appreciate this is convenient for customers but it frustrates me that essentially, they are happy to take more money from me without any verification of my identity but when it comes to me stopping payments, no amount of convenience is offered.That's not the sort of customer service that leaves you feeling good about giving them your money.",1
I didn't really like Vodafone. I used it for three months. Tariffs are raised all the time. Bad internet. I wouldn't advise it.,1
"Honest review, I had a very hard time figuring out how to cancel my broadband subscription.

"I have taken out a device plan with the Vodafone unfortunately due to no-fault of my own my phone is now faulty. I’ve taken it to the Apple Store but as it’s not under warranty with Apple, they quoted me a price to fix it which I was not prepared to payI have only had the phone for about 4 to 6 weeks before the fault occurred. The phone is in pristine condition. There is no water damage. There is no cracks or scuffs on the device.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was slavina I have probably spelt that wrongI called At 8:12 am on the 7th of October 2024In regards to my faulty phone and I did my displeasure about my service with the chat box online and a previous attempt at calling,After spending 27 minutes on the phoneThey were unable to book my phone for repair because of a system errorBefore I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceI’m kind of 50-50 at the moment because I’ve never been overcharged and I like my contractThe service has room for improvement, but it’s not the worst I’ve receivedI’m going into store on my next day off to book a repair in person as I’m not confident the agent was able to book the repair for meShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to book it. I’m not sure if she was aware of the system error before.Why is my phone being faulty? I don’t have any complaints with Vodafone however whenever anything goes wrong, you’re going to be dissatisfied.Will update my review/post another once I return from visiting the store to see if I can get my phone booked for repairThis wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome would be a lie",1

"I have to start by saying that I had been with Virginmedia for 23 years and quite honestly had had enough. They constantly kept putting up their prices. I also did not like being put through to India, where not all of the people spoke good English. I looked on the internet and decided that I would go to Vodafone, also so did a friend of mine. We were being connected the same day. Her's done is 40 minutes mine over 6 weeks. Not really Vodafone fault since the internet said I had City Cable but there's the rub. Whosoever put this cable in didn't leave any markers for connection!! Well as usual all took ages for find the cable then digging a hole and putting in the connection then City Cable arriving for the box and connection. Not the nicest of workmen but perhaps I was just unlucky. The guy in the house very nice and tidy, Now all connected await 12/24 hours for the phone to be connected. Well after 24 hours no phone, back to Vodafone they explained that the number had not been called upon as it was 21 days from closing until recall. Ok so at last I had Broadband then guess what my printer was off line because everything had been closed down for days. Got that sorted and new inks and at last heaven be praised I had everything working after over 6 weeks. This is problem, three different companies working and it does not work. I do not work from home, had I been doing so it would have been a disaster. My friend is very happy she did not have the delay, why you ask? well she had a telegraph pole in her street and I did not. The moral of this story is ""if you are going to go to Vodafone make sure that you have City Cable in your street and that there is a marker."" Otherwise expect a delay. I would like to add that Vodafone have tried to help, they gave me a cash amount back and the villains really seem to be City Cable, Vodafone were slow in the telephone connection but in the end we got there, for me it was a nightmare but not the end as I do not work from home and so when you get someone to dig a hole please let them have the brains not to fill it in without leaving markers.",1

"Like others I have been with Vodafone for years, and have a number of contracts with them, and never missed a payment. My first moan is that a couple of my contracts were recently due for renewal, and I got the usual text/mail offering a nice new Samsung. Go through the renewal/upgrade, and get told I cannot have what I want as I have failed the Credit Check. I have no issues getting credit elsewhere, so just renewed SIM only, and purchased my phone elsewhere, and cheaper. So Vodaphone lost money there.Next thing I have a mobile broadband contract that I wish to cancel, it never gets used but costs £43.00 a month. It expired in December 22, and I still can't cancel it. Like others have said, the customer service appalling, worst I have ever come across. You speak to TOBI their automated crap bot, who is as useful as a Chocolate fire guard in a firestorm. First time I managed to get a number and spoke to a human, who then spends hours trying to convince you to stay, which I didn't want. They assured me they could convert my account to pay as you go, and I wouldn't have to keep paying, and would send a mail confirming this. Mail never arrived, and I'm still paying full whack, so total and utter BS.Today I tried TOBI again, and managed to get a live person on the live chat, immediately I start the chat I get kicked due to inactivity which was the damn wait in the queue.Went through the pain in the proverbial motions again, and... same thing happens a bit further in.Guess what Vodafone, I am going to go to my local store, and have a go there, and will create a scene if it can't be completed there. I am keeping evidence of everything I try, as if you do not sort it, I will consider legal action as you hold people to ransom.I see on other reviews on here you tell people to use Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, well guess what, I do not use such social media as I am over the age of 12!!! I have no interest in having accounts on those platforms what so ever, so how does somebody like me cancel the DAMN Contract. You used to be so good, now you are utterly useless. I will be leaving when all my contracts come up for renewal, as your customer support is the worst ever.Update: 19/03/2023Not surprisingly after the review above, which was originally 1 - Star I have managed to cancel the contract following the links supplied in the reply to my review from Vodafone. Why it couldn't have been this easy originally I can only guess it is to put people off of leaving Vodafone due to it being too difficult. However once I followed the links supplied it was easy enough to cancel the one contract I do not use, and therefore I have increased the rating to 3 - stars.",1
Paying for a 70mb+ link but actually getting 58mb!! Poor shoe,1
"Taken out a 2 year Broadband Service 500Mbs, changing over from BT 100Mbs service. Took about around half a day for the service to start but the VOIP transfer of the phone number from BT took somewhat longer. That doesn't surprise me and I wouldn't jump to conclusions the extra delay in down to Vodafone. Getting a mobile number transferred between operators  generally goes much more smoothly than transfer of landline numbers. I think it's a good deal at least for the contact period, even factoring in the ubiquitous April over inflation price increases that everyone applies.But whilst my phone number is now recognized the phone still doesn't work as they forgot to include a VOIP phone adapter in the equipment they sent me so they are having to now send through a  BS 6312 (BT) female to RJ11 male adapter separately. The order did include wired phone service  so I'm uncertain whether this omission was a mistake OR if they are just trying to penny pinch by excluding the adapter from the package. It's probably not a great idea to let people try to source their own VOIP adaptor, because there are various types with/without low pass filter and with/without ringing capacitor, and use of the wrong type could then lead to further issues.They did send superfluous adaptors for DSL which I don't need as I'm on Optical Fibre now and don't actually have a copper line any longer. In general I think they could save a bit of cost AND give a better service by matching up the equipment they send with the equipment needed for the order.The telephone  support for this problem was OK, but the link they sent via SMS for video call setup (so they could look at the connections on the back of the router) didn't work so well as the web page on the link  wouldn't let me grant permissions to use my smart phone camera whilst the ongoing phone call icon was still on screen in the foreground. So I had to drop the phone call first in order to grant permissions, and was then me on a video call for where I couldn't hear/see any one on the other end. It did the job though and I left the camera pointing at the back of the router and it became clear later that they had seen what they needed to see when they called me back (though the security questions all needed going through again). I've certainly had a lot worse support from other ISPs and was straight through to someone without waiting when I called them.The router they sent is a Technicolor THG3000. Comparable specs to the Sagecom built BT Smart Hub2 that I was using previously. Slightly more intuitive web user interface, I think. But still no 802.11ax (WiFi 6) or WPA3 security option. Would be nice to see movement from WiFi 5 as some operators are now gearing up to roll out routers with WiFi 7. I was hoping for a WiFi 6 based router, but not too surprised that I didn't get one.Update: The VoIP adapter arrived, but it still didn't have a ringing capacitor within it so everything worked apart from my phone not actually ringing when it's receiving a call. However I know the superfluous DSL filter I was sent will have a 1.0 - 1.8 uF capacitance across the 2 wire voice line side. So I connect the VOIP adapter to the router, the DSL filter to the VOIP adapter, and the phone to the voice side of the DSL filter and BINGO the phone now rings. Nothing like the diagram I was sent but it works. I have the advantage of having worked for GEC Plessey Telecoms in the past so I understood what a non ringing phone means and how to fix that. I fear that Vodafone don't understand any of it anymore because everything is outsourced in such a way that the left hand no longer knows what the right is doing and there is less and less technical expertise actually left in the company itself.",1

"To be honest I have mixed feelings with Vodafone and not entirely sure if I will stick with them, since day one having tech issues with my Motorola handset every occasion I go into the east Kilbride branch they look it over and because it works there and then they do nothing I find this poor for well over a year and a half same issues the phone freezes up or shuts down yet I'm looked at as if I'm making it up, the broadband also for few months persistent in losing signal, so I don't envisage a continuation in being a client at end of contracts have ran their course",1
"affordable, but not the best option i have had in Europe.",1
Helpful and but unable to fix what was needed,1
"I am not outright faulting Vodafone passé but I have been having issues with my handset for over a year pretty much when I have went into the east Kilbride store the phone on five occasions did work, the one time it never they did offer to inspect yet a courtesy phone was a no shot, I don't do Web chat I have tried to contact Vodafone on two email addresses yet my email comes back as undeliverable, this is highly tedious, does anyone have a correct email address for me to get hold of them?",1

No sign they are going to turn up any time soon. Vodafone have no idea what they are doing even if they say they do. Stick with the copper. Or use another provider that does not use city fibre stick with bt. Update - Broadband and home phone back up. Took 10 days and a trip to the shop. But we are back up now.

"I've used Vodafone mobile for the last 15 years or so, never had a problem.Just switched to their broadband and my goodness what a joke.Appalling download speeds, well under their ""guaranteed minimum"", frequent disconnects across multiple devices, the inability to download updates/apps from the Google Play store on my phone - meaning using a VPN or mobile data to keep everything up to date, even YouTube struggles to load.3 stars overall due to the non-issue of my mobile, but 1 star for broadband.In hindsight I wouldn't switch if they were paying me.",1
"Wow, I see that a lot of people are not happy with the price hikes. 10.5% CPI, 3.9% towards rolling out full fibre to more homes. I'm not even a full fibre customer so I will be paying this added cost so others receive a faster service. So in total, a 14.4% increase to me mid contract.Originally when I joined Vodafone, I was paying about £19 a month for 55Mbs, with the latest increase, its closer to £26.The price of my current plan is actually closer to what people are paying for full fibre, 500Mbs symmetrical download/upload. This means less value for me.I still have over a year of my contract left with Vodafone but it actually worked out cheaper for me to cancel it anyway and pay the cancellation fee.The cancellation fee is based on money that you would have paid Vodafone minus the costs that Vodafone have to pay as a result of you, being their customer. By this, I mean, they deduct tax, deduct line rental for however many months and then recalculate the tax based on the new amount.This meant that the cancellation fee for the remaining year of contract was about £82.I then found a company called Lit that would do me full fibre, 500Mbs download, 500Mbs upload for £27 a month.Based on me still being in a contract with Vodafone, they also offered me 6 months free service to cover the cost of my cancellation fee. They have also promised me that there will not be any mid contract price hikes.This means that I now have a new 24 month contract with the first 6 months free, followed by 18 payments of exactly £27. Total for 24 months, including cancellation fee is £568.Vodafone said they had a better deal as I wouldn't have to pay the cancellation fee and I wouldn't have to pay the 14.4% this April if I took out a new contract.They offered me 500Mbs download (250Mbs guaranteed) 68Mbs upload for £30 a month. Taking into consideration that CPI will be added April 2024, I estimated that my bill would increase to £35 a month for approximately 12 months. In total, it would have costed me £780 to take another 24 month contract with Vodafone.I explained the numbers to the Vodafone advisor who still insisted that their deal was some how better. A lot of attention was focused on the cancellation fee that obviously I had already allowed for and factored in when comparing what was on offer.The advisor then proceeded to try and discredit Lit, saying they have never heard of them. I forwarded a link to their website. The advisor then said there wasn't any reviews, so I forwarded them a link to trustpilot where Lit score 4.9 out of 5. The advisor said that they didn't think I would get 6 months for free and to be careful incase it's a scam. They then said that the 6 months free is probably offered because they are a business that knows its going under. I explained it was to compensate people for the cancellation fee when switching mid contract. He then said that my contract will definitely still go up with Lit as all companies have to increase contracts based on CPI. I had to send a screenshot to the advisor to prove that Lit do not hike prices mid contract. This is also true for companies like Tescos mobile who also don't increase their prices.I feel like a lot of what I was being told wasn't strictly correct, so do be careful what you believe. The chat also went on for several hours despite me originally only contacting Vodafone to give my 30 days notice.I am, however, still suprised that Vodafone have a rating of 1.3 out of 5 on here. Despite my moan above, my service with Vodafone has been fantastic over the years that I've been with them. My speeds were always where they should have been and the service was very reliable with next to no drop outs. If there ever was a problem, Vodafone were quick to get it resolved.The low rating on here is quite harsh and not really a true reflection of them as a company. I would definitely consider moving back to Vodafone in the future if they have a good deal on.Unfortunately, being loyal to one company doesn't really work in the consumers favour and quite often results in prices continually increasing the longer you stay with them. As consumers, it is up to us to shop around for the best deals.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for a long time  6 months  ago they notified me they were carrying out works on the local mast nearby where we live , we are located in a rural area ,when we moved in 4G was the only way to get broadband we invested initially  in a Vodafone router but this wasnt suitable  , we used a tp link brilliant 15mb download  23 upload , now we barley get 1_2 mb even our mobiles  only show 1bar , despite emailing  phoning  all the same response nothing wrong in the area , complained on line no response , yesterday i emailed Vodafone  GH they responded in less than an hour suggesting I contact the uk sector but sadly their is nobody  that will help all you get is Vodafone technical says its all ok , so i purchased an o2 data sim well what can i say O2  30mb download speed ,update finally  they have confirmed the service is not as expected , they have provided a new sim in the broadband unit,this increased the download to 4mb we can live with for the next 12 weeks  as that's the date when Vodafone believe the service will be back to expectation.",1
my router dropps connection few times a daynot really happy about that,1
"Good service, very helpful",1
Not happy with them. I have managed to move away from them to a different phone company.  I can't wait to do the same with my internet.,1
Broadband is good enough but I haven’t been charged since renewing my contract months ago and getting hold of a customer service agent is impossible! Why should I spend hours of my time repeatedly calling them?,1
"I rung customer service to enquire if I could use my Internet outside EU, bare in mind that I have only basic package, sim only contract.Lovely man Fauz(apologies in advance if I have misspelled your name) answered the call. He was extremely helpful and understanding. He done all he could to help me to set up my phone to be able to use roaming abroad and to receive notifications of the usage and charges, I had a very pleasant experience dealing with Vodafone customer service.But after my trip to Latin America, I must say that it was pretty horrifying to discover that there was no use of any of that at all. My phone wasn't usable abroad.  No roaming was working, I had no data of what so ever, had no signal, couldn't call nor message.  Luckily enough that I have been spending time with my friends and I have been able to use their data and WiFi in hotel.I am still very happy with the person handling the call, because he was asking for advice on my query of his manager.  But the manager who ever it was should have done his homework before misleading people.",1
"For querying a cancelled broadband order, online chatbot is hopeless, human customer services is superb.",1
"An excellent service again from Staff at the Vodaphone store in Spalding. I had a problem accessing my phone.I visited unannounced, received a warm welcome, explained the issue to them in non technical terms and they immediately started to work on the problem and resolved it. I could not fault the service. It is so much better than the stores nearer to me in Peterborough and Stamford.",1
"2 days ago I tried to put £10 into PAYG.  The site kept crashing.Yesterday I got it to accept the £10 but failed to credit.I then spent ages on the landline to get it credited.  It then showed £10.46.Not trusting it, I checked to day.  It invited me to pay in again.  When I declined the £10.46 suddenly changed to £0.46.Edd: since I wrote that, a helpful Indian assistant on Vodavone (chat) sorted it out.  So I've upped it fo 3 stars.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for almost 25 years (!)In my experience, they have been the best network in terms of reliability for signal strength. Maybe I've just been lucky with the places I've lived but others around me on different networks have often struggled...On the downside, customer services has mostly been poor to infuriating. If the reliability of the network signal hadn't been so consistent, I would have left them years ago. Vodafone have absolutely no interest in customer retention. They've never given me a deal or discount on any contract. Business is business I suppose!",1
Vodafone offering new customers Deals at £22. Loyal customers zilch. So much for caring about your current customers!!!As to your reply why do you not say this in your advert??,1
"I spent the best part of 2hrs on the phone trying to merge two accounts into one. If it wasn't for ""Amy"" then I would have probably considered leaving. Real credit and was very helpful.",1
"Recently moved to Vodafone broadband. I was not informed that I would lose my pstn line as part of the move except for the dial tone. This means I cannot use any of my telephone extensions.I raised that with them but they are not able to offer any solution. I asked to cancel the service as this is useless to me but was informed that I was out of my cancellation period. I wish I had stayed with plusnet, they offer fantastic service.Update. Vodaphone came back and offered me the opportunity to cancel at no cost . They still need to be clear on the 60mbit product that people lost the old phone line.",1
Appalling .My broadband speed has dropped to unacceptable levels compared to service i pay for . I have spent nearly an hour going round in circles going nowhere trying to rectify situation. The app is useless and trying to contact someone to speak to is impossible . The chat bot is a complete joke . Im having no choice but to cancel contract and sign up whereelse with a provider that wants to offer some level of customer care and a decent reliable service.Following on... an hour later... the bot chat kicked in and actually managed to help escalate issue with engineers. Awaiting further tests but a little more hopeful than an hour ago.,1
"Joined vodafone in may 2021, the only complaint i have is that the vodafone  coverage map is totally useless,i go to places that have no coverage but according to the coverage checker its excellent.very misleading",1
"Poor service:  I Purchased a mobile phone via Vodafone I was told there would be a slight delay then got a message item to be delivered tomorrow. When it did not arrive after three days called customer service to enquire about my phone delivery. I was told oh the warehouse have not been notified! of your order we will inform them.When I asked will I get it for next week? the customer service agent dodged the question!! TWICE,  Still Waiting!!.I will not be ordering any other goods etc. from this company.Update on the 5th day the item was delivered I was eventually notified of delivery fortunately I had made no arrangements for the day of delivery. Accordingly I have made an amendment to my Review. When enquiring/purchasing I was not informed that the phone comes with no charging plug this has to be purchased separately!.",1
"Called in to upgrade and asked for price match with EE for my new contract as the current one is expiring end of the month. I am being told I need to pay an early termination fees for upgrade, when I asked if the new contract can start straight after my current contract ends the answer to that was no.I dont understand why they cant start my new contract when the current one ends, waste of time and money.Requested my PAC code to move to EE as they are offering same deal but without extra charge for ""early termination"". Shame that an existing customer of close to a decade is being treated like this just so they can make an extra £35 when my monthly bill is £70+.Edit: Received a call from Voda representative and they were able to settle this for me without an issue. I understand what early termination fee is for but customers should be offered the ability to line up another contract straight after current one expires. Issue resolved but shouldnt have occured to begin with.",1
"It's a mixed bag with VF. When I first came back to VF there were some issues with setup on my account, namely WiFi calling and VoLTE. I was surprised to get a call from a UK representative to follow up but the accounts/network team had actually fixed the issues already. This was a pleasant surprise after past experiences.Why have I marked them down? Simple, there is far too many times, not even in ""the sticks"", where I get a good 4G signal but no data throughput at all!! There are also too many times of dropping down to 3G as well with incredibly slow speeds. It is very clear after testing that VF are relying far too much on Band 20 (B20) to give coverage but it is being swamped too easily. Unfortunately they seem to be concentrating on 5G in cities where suburban and rural areas continue to suffer dire coverage and speeds!",1
"How can another company do a cheaper tariff than Vodafone can do, on same phone, Vodafone network, 6gb data, £9 cheaper",1
"I've been with Vodafone for mobile and home broadband for years and never had any issues. I always found support efficient. However, my recent experience has wiped out any confidence that I had with them. Broadband upgrade to full fibre went off schedule when open reach didn't install the fibre optics in time.Not vodafones fault, but I was assured by vf that the install would still go ahead as planned. Waited in all  day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that the Installation date had moved by 3 weeks. Waited in all day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that it had now been moved by another 10 days.That's today.Contacted vf to find out what time today, to be told that the whole order has been cancelled, My adsl is due to be terminated this evening as part of the fibre upgrade.So I've no fibre and no Internet as from tomorrow.I'm stubborn and ordinarily I'd tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine, however the compensation due will be huge. Maybe pay for two years internet, so I'm sticking with them just for the fun of the compensation claim.edit 24.03.23:Vodafone did eventually complete my install, albiet about 38 days late.As they are signed up to the automatic compensation scheme, I was due compensation, to the tune of about £250.I did have to fight for this, however got there in the end.So whilst initially it was stressful, the compensation did end up paying about 15 months worth of my contract, and the connection has been great since.",1
I have been a vodaphone customer since April 2021.  Never a problem then in December 7th my internet stopped working. I work in care and due to Covid was working every day due to being short staffed so no time to call.I eventually called on the 18th December and had a video call with a lady. She was very helpful looked at my modem and everything but could not see what was causing the problem but confirmed my internet had been down since 7th of December which was day I had new carpets fitted. So she said an engineer would be out on Monday 20th but he didn’t turn up. My son was here on 3rd of January and fixed the problem in minutes.I then received a bill for 2 months so I called again and the caller told me engineer had called me on the 20th to say he was coming but had not missed calls on that day. She then sorted my bill so I only had to pay 1 month and insured me I would recieve compensation for all days after problem was reported. So far I’ve heard nothing. Very disappointed in poor service. Only giving 3 stars as the girls I spoke we’re really nice and as helpful as they could be.,1
"I have been with Vodafone broadband for 4 years. I have never had a problem. I moved house taking Vodafone with me and had no problems at all, although it was a hefty fee to move them with me (£60) and a month wait to get it installed, which I was told was normal across all companies?The speeds have been fine. Have had drop outs a few times a year but they are short lived and back to normal within minutes, nothing to get frustrated about. My husband says the internet is slow (we have the super fast fibre) and prefers to use his mobile data but I honestly do not notice the speed being slow, maybe because he doesn’t use it relieving the pressure of demand? All in all I would probably recommend Vodafone broadband. At the moment we are out of contract so our monthly payment is more than if we were in contract, I haven’t renewed a contract as I like the fact that I have the option to just leave if I want to, but so far I haven’t needed to. On the other hand I have had no end of trouble with Vodafone mobile contracts in the past but no problems for over a year now so fingers crossed 🤞 it stays that way.",1
Vodafone contacted me and finally removed the information from my credit reference. Thank you,1
"Eventually customer service sorted my issue, but before that it was a merry go round of speaking to different departments.My contract with Vodafone transferred to me in the middle of the month. I'd been with them for over a decade and never had problems. I'm on a plan with 25GB data per month. Then suddenly, two days into August, I get a text saying I had only 2GB worth of data left. Which made no sense as I was constantly using wifi at home and I work from home.The first person I spoke to said it was a glitch and that she would renew my data amount. Nothing happened.The second person said it was the 'transition period' of the contract transition, and that it would renew properly on the 8th of August, today. Nothing happened.On my third call, I spoke to someone who knew what they were doing and did a deep dig into my daily data use and summarised that I had used 9GB instead of 22GB when travelling the prior week, which made sense. However a colleague then told her that the day-by-day data wasn't accurate and that 22GB was correct, which also made no sense. He wasn't helpful, and reiterated it was on my end and not theirs.Under family advice I called up Retentions threatening to leave and got an extra 2GB for free as a good will gesture. Doesn't explain where 13GB went, but it's better than nothing.I will be doing better research into other providers next year as a back-up.",1
"I've been with Vodaphone for several years (phone contracts). I can't say the connection has ever been bad (so 5 stars for that) but it is hard work to call them. Is anyone any good at customer service??? On price, I have an issue. I'm way past my upgrade date and I get occasional offers 'just for me' (not explicit, but this is implied by the wording). The price has been no different to anyone else asking (i.e. via website as a ""new"" customer). Moreover, other suppliers are consistently cheaper, and by a lot. You get a £29 up front fee even for a PAYG contract on an iphone with Vodaphone, not so in other places, and it's £15 a month cheaper elsewhere for identical phone and terms. I phoned them to try to avoid the small amount of hassle to transfer my number elsewhere and offered to show proof of a better quote for the same contract. They wouldn't budge.They've largely ignored me for the best part of 10 years and within two hours of requesting a PAC code, they're phoning me! Too late, you made me feel as though I was inconsequential and not worthy of a comparable deal to your competitors.So overall, five stars for reliable phone connection, but 1 star for not making me feel like a valued customer, hence 3 stars on average.",1
June 2022:The Vodafone network has been down in postcode SK13 5DP for nearly 3 weeks. I received a text saying maintenance complete but the Vodafone network is still down in this area. There have been problems for 3 weeks now and no one at Vodafone seems to know what the problem is or when it will be fixed. Even their website shows the network is down. This is a rural area and people rely on their phones to keep in touch. Total shambles.July 17th 2022:After some investigation I have discovered that at the end of June 2022 Vodafone upgraded my local mast as part of maintenance program in preparation for 5G. The upgrade failed and the mast shutdown. My device then  connected to another mast further away greatly reducing my service (2 bars from 5 bars). The Vodafone website stated there was a fault for a few days and then said service was back to normal which it wasn't. After a coupe of weeks my service has improved and I am getting excellent down /upload speeds so it seems to have been fixed. Vodafone clearly had a problem and I just wish they would have been honest. Their contact centre and the TOBI app just lied to me or disconnected me when I tried to investigate the problem. Vodafone have provided me with good mobile service over the years but they really need to improve their contact centers who do not seem to have a clue when their is a major network outage.I have increased my rating as I am now getting excellent speeds. People on the Vodafone Forum were very helpful.,1
"Not the best service I have received, was left for too long with no response!",1
"customer service were just ok, they are expensive but not the worst out there",1
"One star, because this is the 3rd time Vodafone have screwed up causing chaos due to their clueless, incompetent and dishonest call centre staff. With her no longer needing it, I cancelled the line on our late mother's Apple Watch that has been a safety line for her. Vodafone forgot to cancel it leading to continued charges that totalled, wait for it, £12 or so. As a matter of principle, I refused to pay it and call centre staff said they would cancel and write it off - twice. A year later, they have raised the debt to £38, and it has appeared on Experian wrecking my otherwise good credit, causing chaos in my life. I wish to sue Vodafone for damages being it is impossible, even via Twitter messaging, to communicate with a real English first language human being. Their Twitter account says to use their useless online chat service! It's useless!(The other two instances: Despite arranging it before leaving for mainland Europe in 2014, Vodafone forgot to switch on travel roaming, so I was billed many times my actual call/data costs. They did refund the money/credit it, but error caused me much stress. This happened earlier too on a different trip.)Update - Sept 26 2022: Unbelievable, so Vodafone have pinned the blame on us, despite fact the account was closed and NO debt was due. What you are doing is fraud and dishonest. I spent ages on phone today to try and resolve this, but your staff needed 5 of 7 security questions answering, some of which were rediculous being we have no way of knowing dates of events long ago, forcing us to visit a store. Don’t forget, YOUR error is costing US money and inconvenience. It is unacceptable that you do not keep suitable records.Update - Matter resolved. Sad that I had to post here to get attention. Store staff v helpful. However, the confirmation email promised by call centre lady never arrived. As per my other reviews, all these issues will end when companies return to in person engagement and scrap chat bots and overseas call centres. We’re human.",1
Did not like how they managed my cell plan. So overpriced,1
Worse service out of all UK providers in my opinion.,1
Fairly average service and not cheap either,1
"Today after 7 and a half years, I received my PAC code from Vodafone. I'm not going to write a dramatic 1 star review. My signal with Vodafone is generally strong and I've had no issues with customer services. But this company has consumer ethics problems.However, since COVID, the signal has not been as strong. I used to be the only person in my group of friends who used to get a signal at the football and now I'm not, it's as bad as the rest. So when I get e-mails telling me my prices are going up because of the cost of living, I expect to see my service being excellent. But unfortunately it went backwards.My bill has gone up and up and the cost of living raise was, I'm afraid, unfair, exploitative and the final straw and the reason I am leaving today. This is from the e-mail in March:""The monthly cost of your plan will go up from your April 2022 bill. As set out in the terms of your agreement with us, this increase is the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 5.4% (as published in January 2022) to support the rise in our running costs and keep up with increased demand, plus an additional 3.9% to continue essential investment in our network as we expand coverage.""This is frankly predatory and I will not support it. So I am off to Lebara - they use the Vodafone network and will charge me about a quarter of what I currently pay with a superior deal. I am sad to be leaving, I have been with Vodafone for the best part of 8 years. But the SIM only tariffs are no longer competitive, there was no real effort to keep my custom (not that I was ever going to stay) and I cannot emphasise enough how much I dislike that 3.9% rise. My coverage has got worse, not better, so previous rises are obviously not being spent wisely.In terms of coverage and overall experience, I have had few issues with Vodafone. In fact, they're pretty good. But the time has come to seek cheaper pastures elsewhere because a 9.3% rise when cost of living is out of control is predatory, exploitative and downright unfair.So you will get good coverage and friendly customer service experience, but you will pay for it and it will be outside of the amount you agreed to pay every month.Goodbye Vodafone. It's been fun.",1
Expensive tariffs I think they could do better,1
"Whatever happened to Vodafone? Having returned after over 10+ years its very clear their customer service has diminished beyond any hope. Whilst buying a new contract via the Vodafone website store was a very straight forward pleasant experience - that I'm afraid is where the pleasant part of the buying experience ends.Speaking to anyone regarding an order afterwards is near on impossible, (waited over an hour half on hold..) live chat is as much good as a chocolate fireguard (when it working that is!) Vodafone seem to think its perfectly acceptable to fob off customers with ""DPD will be touch when your phone is ready for delivery"" while you simply wait...& wait....& wait....hardly no communication on whats going on at all? Tracking provided just sits there with no movement. Twitter support, although friendly advised my order was taken off back order & shouldn't be too long, but zero movement on my tracking.The whole experience has been totally dreadful & I really regret it. I very much doubt I'll get delivery before Xmas Day now, but I have ceased caring if honest.The whole buying process has been a pointless, time-wasting & completely frustrating experience.Whilst I appreciate when things go great few people actually give good feedback, but when its bad they are quick to criticise. I give feedback on my own personal experience (positive & negative) but honestly, do think twice before you buy from Vodafone, worst experience ever (and many think Three UK is bad, oh no..Vodafone is far far worse - I should know I've been with Three for like 10+ years)My feedback to Vodafone would be to sort out your disastrous customer care, non existent communications & false delivery promises. Sadly I expected better from Vodafone. I dont really care anymore when my order arrives as it will be promptly returned back to you for a refund.I'm no longer interested in any further interaction with anyone from Vodafone, so please dont bother with a ""copy n paste"" generic reply. The main purpose of this review is to simply give feedback to other prospective customers.Edit: Since found out via my official complaint my order didn't even exist even after taking £100, receiving all contract docs & a hard credit check on my file. They want me to cancel & re-order? Amazes me how you manage to keep customers, shocking!Edit: Resolved via Exec Office, I have increased my  score rating purely based on how exceptional my complaints case manager (Andy) & an amazingly helpful Sales advisor (Sarge) resolved this today. Be thankful you have these guys @Vodaphone they restored my confidence that ""some"" people DO care about customers within your company. Give them a medal on my behalf.",1
"Signed up for a SIM only contract and got the SIM within a couple of days. All the packaging said it was already activated but it still didn't work 24 hours after installing. I also couldn't log onto my account using the temporary password I'd been emailed. This would only ever give a message that an error has occurred and to try again a moment later.I used the webchat to complain and was told my account hadn't been activated and would be sorted within 24 hours. It wasn't so I tried again the next day to be told it would be done by midnight. Again, it wasn't so I contacted them again and got told 24 hours once again. This time I waited another 2 days before contacting them to be told it would be done by midnight. A day later and I still have no mobile.From what I can see, Vodafone are utterly useless. I've had enough and since I'm still within my 14 day cool off period I'll be ringing up to cancel later. My hopes of Vodafone actually managing that without charging me again are slim.18/03/22 A further update. I just had the most painful conversation ever with someone presumably in India when attempting to cancel the contract. The call seemed to be on a 10 second delay the whole time and mostly consisted of her saying ""Hello"" over me repeatedly. She couldn't find my account for the first 15 minutes because I couldn't give them a mobile number I didn't have. Then when she did find my account, I was told my contract couldn't be cancelled because my account wasn't active and I would need to ring back in 24 hours. After venting for a while about why I wasn't going to do this, and how this was in breach of consumer rights, she said they would ring me back on Monday between and 1 and 2.  I couldn't take any more and reluctantly accepted. This level of service is so poor it beggars belief. I'll go straight to complaints when they presumably don't ring back on Monday. If that doesn't work, next stop will be the ombudsman.22/03/22 I didn't get a call back and the account still isn't activated. I got a reply to this review from Vodafone suggesting to contact the social media team via Facebook/Twitter. I had to sign up to Twitter specifically for the purpose but finally got a clear answer that they apparently won't activate the SIM and account until the day my old number is due to switch on 1st April. This isn't how a switch has worked for me in the past but they also confirmed my cancellation period won't start until then so I'll give them a last chance. The moral of all this seems to be to avoid Vodafone's call centres and go to their social media team if you want any help.06/04/22My account activated as promised above and I've had no problems since. Still not happy with the state of the service I received or the contradictory communication about how the switch process worked in the first place but I'm revising up to 3 stars since they did at least get there in the end.",1

"When I first ordered the Vodafone deal, I was explained the discounts from my work place were applied, it wasn't and for almost a year I was paying the full contract price. Until I lost all three careers I had in a month, I had to pursue the deal to help me out of debt. It took me like 3-5 calls to customer service in Egypt to resolve this matter. The hassle and time it took get my discount reinstated was seriously out of order.Finally managed to speak to a really good customer service agent that applied the discount and 1 month free. He provided excellent customer communication from Egypt. He was smooth, understanding and delivered results. The reference of this call was (K24YBOVQ).3 stars given because I went through madness to get my entitlement by then what was the point, if all my receiving calls are going straight to voicemail. Even though my silent mode and do not disturb mode is off. This issue was raised over 2 months ago and again I was told it was resolved. But it wasn't and were back to square one again, customer agents spitting false promises. I have missed so many important calls this past year and the contract is still effecting my life other ways.",1
"I bought a mobiphone for £11:00 and had problems using it. I could not go to the shop because of the loony lockdown nonsense. I had to phone ""customer Service"" they were as much use as a chocolate Teapot.  I went back to the store in time to find out the idiot in some Asian country had changed my package by cancelling it and given me a new one and lost my  initial £10.  I was in the Harrow store and it was ""sorted out"" by some person and without telling me my new £20 on the phone was going to cost me £1:00 to send a text with 4 charactors in it!  Today customer service confirmed I was on the package I did not want nor was told about the disgusting charges.  they could do noting and their english was APPALLING! So I have destroyed the phone and gone to another provider who is simply going to charge me 5p when i send a text which is about twice a month.BEWARE OF VODFONE AT ALL COSTS.  Whatever the Sales person says make them put it in writing or walk out of the shop.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Don't bother VOdaphone you have lied too many times.  I have switched to 1p mobile who ACTUALLY do charge 1p a text rather than £1.00 a text like you swindlers!Oh and with a PAC code I can keep my numberSo GOD bless1pMobile they do let you keep your phone number and only charge 1p a text or 1p a minute for a call, and you only HAVE to credit £10:00 every 3 months A BETTER DEAL THAN ANY VODAPHONE PACKAGE.GOOD RIDDENCE!!!!!You can thank the liar at HARROW for you losing you yet onother customer!!!!!",1

"The deals aren't the best on the market. I never really had an issue with them, swapped to them from EE (really disliked EE) stayed with them after my contract ended, changed to sim only contract, and when my discount on my account came to an end over a year later. I called, online chatted multiple times, got passed onto someone else, and no matter how many times I asked for the discount to be added back onto my account, they weren't arsed.They just wanted to give me less, for more money. I even quoted other companies deals that beat theirs and still didn't budge, said I'd leave and theyd lose me as a customer all together meaning 0 money at all to them.. Again not bothered.Left and went with Lebara for half the price (permanently. Not a temporary deal)",1

I upgraded last September to the IPhone 12 (I moved to EE) it took countless phone calls to get them to finally cancel my old contract even though I had finish the 24 month term.They finally cancelled it in January. In June my credit score now shows 2 missed payments from them.They never contacted me about this.Not only did they basically refuse to cancel my contract for months, they then never told me they still wanted money after it was cancelled.They have completely screwed me and my credit score which will hurt me when I need a loan or mortgage etc.An utter disgrace of a company I will never use again.I want to add a P.S. after a few phones calls and a long call they took the arrears away, I wrote this review when I shouldn’t have, in the heat of the moment. During my 24 month contract they were a great company, but between last September/October to now (June) it’s been horrible, but they did take the arrears off saying mistakes were made by them in reference to contacting me about a payment etc. So fair play to Vodafone for doing it. I want to leave my review up because it really has been horrible trying to get away from Vodafone but I’m not too big of a man to realise that I wrote it when I was angry.",1
"My bill is apparently £10 but I’m being charged £17, and am unable to get through to customer service. Avoid.Edit: called 191 and eventually got through to a customer service rep.",1
I had a problem with Vodafone UK.  This has now been resolved  in my favour . Well done Clare Wilkerson from media services at vodafone UK.,1
Just upgraded but wasn't given a free Amazon voucher as offered.Dissatisfaction is the result.,1
I've had pretty good service over the years. But the process of negotiating a fairly priced upgrade is getting harder and harder,1
"Asda have transferred fron EE to Vodafone so it was either accept it or go somewhere else for my PAYG.  And there's less and less choice.Asda were 8p a minute for mobile calls with a Customer Service call centre in the North East, with great staff (who, as it happens, are employed by EE). That's all changed now. Asda Mobile Customer Service (i.e. Vofafone) are in Egypt and whilst they seem to know what they're doing and are polite and as helpful as they can be the lines aren't great (poor reception) and there isn't the same ease of conversation that there was with UK based staff.However calls are now down to 4p per minute (or they are for the time being) and you just need to make one, six monthly, chargeable text or call to keep the account active. No obligatory top up every six months.'Three' used to have something similar but their rates went up recently and their customer service was patchy. So it's all change - and it's likely to keep changing.",1
"""Reply from Vodafone UK2 hours agoHey there,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

I'm not on any social media, only a few internet forums.My previous supplier has since contacted me to resolve their previous issue and i've decided to stay with them. I contacted your web chat to cancel but I can't cancel by web chat or email. I have to cancel through the 0808 0034515 phone line. Web chat did give me a 17 digit reference code and put a note on my account so the person taking the call could understand it wouldn't be me, (the account holder), who was phoning to cancel. We've tried this once so far but were cut off after 14 minutes. I'm not criticising Vodafone staff or their product, but it is frustrating.",1
not good service - very expensive and little help,1
"A bit painful overall unfortunately, but the customer staff were as great as they could be.Saw a great offer online in March for Samsung S21 5G, Unlimited Max plan. With a guaranteed trade in of my S10e (subject to meeting conditions), £44 per month (24 months). Great deal!Placed order Wed 31 Mar after 10.00pm, so too late for next day delivery. Fine. It's Easter weekend so can wait until the following Tues.Received email confirmation 22.31 for delivery on Tues 6 Apr. Nothing delivered.On inquiring, response was that the order was cancelled due to a 'technical issue'. No reason for error given, or why no follow up email to tell me. Passed around from initial complaints to upgrades to customer care, back to upgrades, etc.... Upshot - I can upgrade but only at today's (7 Apr) rates (which, shock, are not as generous); not the one I thought I signed up to (when I got my last phone, the following month the plan price went down. I had no recourse to ask for a better rate though...)Small print online states the contract only applies 'when the product is dispatched'. Not when you click that button to purchase. Not when you get the confirmation email. Not when you get it in your grubby little mitts. But only when dispatched. As such, it appears that if the courier loses it, or it is delayed... you are still liable to pay the prevailing rate (until found or proved stolen, I assume). If the order is cancelled by Vodafone (for any one of a number of reasons - or none, just a 'technical error'...), unlucky, no contract stands. The risk is transferred to you, my friends. Tell me I am wrong, Vodafone. Then I will show you your own terms and conditions.If you order online, get a confirmation and take a day off and get no email to say it is cancelled. Unlucky as no contract. And you cannot then ask for the original terms to be honoured as the 'deal is no longer available'. Those good old T&C.What was good was the attitude of all the customer support staff I engaged with. They got it. They listened. They were obviously limited by company policy. After putting in a formal (email) written complaint since the phone system just wasn't working, I got a response very quickly and the guy was great. The key thing was the confirmation email I received, that proved I had made the order - it was the only evidence as 'nothing was in the system' (don't delete those emails, folks). Complaint upheld in terms of cancellation made without my knowledge and no confirmatory email sent to me. Nonetheless, the 'technical issue' won through and those pesky terms and conditions (weighted in favour of the company) won out. Legally right; morally...?I have to comment I did go ahead with an upgrade, after being offered 25% discount on another monthly plan; it would be wrong not to disclose this. The deal was decent but not anywhere near as good as that which I thought I had committed to.In short. Customer service were actually really decent and I truly appreciate their attempts to help. But the company-level T&C element leaves the customer in a weak position if things go wrong. You takes your chance folks!",1
Good service but needs to be more efficient when dealing with customer billing problems.I called and the representative was helpful and kind but had to keep putting me on hold to find things out.Overall happy and thanks for the refund for over charge on retail index review.,1
I have been a customer of vodfone mobile it not to bad but I would not go with the broadband it not good but ha I’m with by on broadband and there staff are really bad there made 54 bill and Service scissors people not come to fort thinks out I fand vodfone mobile are better if only the people in the mobile time work with the broadband side it mite be better but any how EE STAY CLEARE IT LIKE Jumping in front of a bus really bad I mean bad it bad talk talk we’ll I have been with them not bad but you pay for what you get slow speed lol 02 mobile stay clear as well I’m staying with vodfone yes there do make mistakes but there do sort it out in the end much but then o2 BT talk talk EE  hope this is help full 👍,1
"I recently inherited a locked to vodafone iphone, the customer service was excellent (when I finally got through) and the phone was unlocked in 24hrs. The main problem is the price and coverage. I have been with Vodafone for 20 years in business and private use. They are great if you live in a major city or only travel on motorways, in the countryside their coverage is poor and the pricing is high unless you haggle hard. Piggy back companies like Lebara offer great deals using the Vodafone network so why can't they offer better prices themselves. I think it is a stagnant company and will continue to lose private custom in favour of business clients",1
"I recently reviewed Vodafone & subsequently added an update, in both posts I slated the company both for keeping me waiting around seven weeks for finally connecting me to broadband & also for the poor customer service. Since my update things have improved a bit so I thought it only fair to also let others know they can do some things right (eventually).They admitted that the service I had received was not acceptable & for that they are giving me an £80 credit, additionally it turned out that although I had signed up for superfast 2 which is up to 63Mbps with a minimum guarantee of 55Mbps, after further tests it seems my line will only support a sync speed of 39.8Mbps, however I was prepared to accept their offer of a reduction in my monthly charges from £23pm to £19.50 as the speed I am getting is ok for my particular needs.It remains to be seen if I continue to get this speed & hopefully don't suffer any disconnections or any discrepancies with my bills.Overall though if it all stays as it is now I will be satisfied with what I have ended up with.",1
"Vodafone set us up quickly, and we had a much faster line than advertised. However, we came home one day and our Internet wasn't working. Contacted support who advised us our account had been cancelled, so they setup an engineer to reconnect us 2 days later. Still no Internet from then so phoned again and was told that the exchange was broken and that in 2 days open reach would be out to fix. Phoned back again 2 days later and was told that the open reach appointment was never scheduled and that in 2 days it would be fixed, surprise surprise no Internet 2 days later and this time told he didn't have the right materials to fix the exchange. Asked for a 4g dongle to keep us connected and were told no as we are not moving house so we asked to cancel and move to another provider, after cancelling we were transferred to customer service who offered us a 4g dongle but were told that the 18.50/month we had agreed to would be going up to 23.50/month. This all happened because apparently we are supposed to phone Vodafone and tell them that our Internet is working? Would avoid at all costs. Just spend an extra couple of quid a month and go to a better provider",1
"I've been with Vodafone for 11 years. 11 years. Now generally that means something for a lot of companies but not Vodafone. Their loyalty discounts are offensive.Anyway, it was that time to renew again. I have had sim only contracts for the last 6 years as I don't care anymore for the latest phone. I was sad to see that I could either get way more than I needed for more money or way less than I needed for the same money. Why can't I just stay on the same plan?This time I considered a phone because mine was on it's way out and thought in the end that I just couldn't simply afford it. Until I went to carphone warehouse where if I started a new contract with Vodafone I would get the latest phone (S21) cheaper than what Vodafone themselves were offering me... what a way to feel valued.I love vodafone I always have. Their signal has been amazing in my area and I love the nostalgia I feel as unlike o2 (once upon time one-2-one) they haven't gone through a name change or anything in the 30 years I've roamed England. Just why disrespect the loyal customers? Don't pretend to be offering me a deal when really I'm being ripped off.My reason for writing this review is due to the odd system I had to go through to change my mobile number from a vodafone sim only contract to my new vodafone contract. I had to order a pay as you go sim, transfer my number to that, then transfer my number to my new vodafone contract sim. WHY?! Please Vodafone, if you can - SORT THIS OUT. Along with your loyalty offers. Either genuinely offer a good deal that you cannot get ELSEWHERE or don't bother. I didn't bother calling to cancel because I don't like the Non-UK based call center.This time you keep my custom, but next time - you may not be so lucky...",1
Kinda disappointed,1
"Online contact doesn't work, automated phone help machine is useless. Help is good when you actually get to speak to someone.I can't log-in to my Vodafone online account as it's sending the access code to my landline via text message, which doesn't work.I try to contact Vodafone using the ""online"" function, but this opens a webpage that never actually loads - great.I call Vodafone, and battle an automated help machine that repeatedly tries to tell me that I can do anything I want via my online account settings (failing to understand that I can't log in), before eventually (and I mean eventually) telling me it will transfer me to someone. The phone rings a few times and then hangs up.2 minutes later, I'm about to leave a scathing review, when my phone rings with Vodafone customer services there, who take me through security and then fixes my log-in problem.So, 5 stars for calling back and fixing the problem quickly - 1 star for the online contact not working and the automated help machine.",1
Everything is slow - why does it take 1hr + to do anything with them - renewing a contract shouldn't be so painful. They also made my contract worse than before - only 100 mins in Europe instead of 500 - dont feel this was clear and appealing this so difficult. Gave up after 45 mins on the phone on a Saturday - I have better things to do!,1
Assured it was a simple process to port my number into vodafone. Its now a week and I still cannot use my phone to dial out or send messages or use data. No timescale on when it will be fixed. Unfortunately now in a position that I have ordered a sim with another company and lost my number as I don't trust it will ever be resolved.At 15:09 5 mins after posting my initial  review on trustpilot I got a message saying my port in is complete. Dont know if its a coincidence or not but changed to a higher rating on the basis its now sorted.,1
I really believe that it is the most value for money company. Very low services still though. Better for family packs.,1
"the chapest of all, but the signal is very low. good packs, especially the students packs.",1
"My broadband order was due to go live on 10th of December, but this failed and the date was stealthily moved back by 4 days, leaving me unable to work from home.Vodafone have at least tried to help though, by offering unlimited data on a SIM card so that I can continue to work. So thanks for that Vodafone, but you really should have completed my broadband order on time.",1
"Back on today after 5 days no serviceEventually sorted out ,and rectified amicably.If you contact the right people ....... it gets sorted 👍 ceo by email 😂",1
"After happily using Vodafone for mobile for years I recently moved house and got their broadband installed. To be fair, surprisingly easy to get hold of customer services via chat or on the phone, but had to speak to them SIX times just to get the router sent to the right place - not one agent I spoke to did what they said they would do until the sixth person. Systems between Vodafone and their delivery partner DPD (useless company) clearly do not work at all. Even when the router was eventually delivered over a week late ('typical' according to the BT installation engineer) the DPD guy came back later in the day to ask for the package back! I refused, obviously, and now all seems to be working fine. Pure chaos, as usual with DPD. Three stars as service eventually seems to be good, but setup process unnecessarily hectic and stressful during a house move. Vodafone you desperately need a dedicated process for people moving house!",1
"My dealings with them have been ""fine"" so far, a little expensive on mobile broadband with few options, but supposedly no throttling and truly unlimited which is nice. Would be nice to have a cheaper option for those of us in areas that don't get 5g and even very bad 4g signals.I'd be happy for a cheaper package on pure 3g but with still unlimited data. Currently I pay £33 a month for around 15mbps at best which is very expensive compared to wired/fibre broadband. It's acceptable though since I have very few choices of networks that actually serve me out here in the country.",1
Not as bad in my experience as most of the reviews. I mean fiver a month 4 payg wiv 300 mins n 3gb data plus rollover to make it 6gb! Dat is better n most cheap sim only dealsJust need better customer service loggin cuz man is always havin 2 explain imself ova n ova again....like a stuck record lol,1
"Went from 1  to  3 been completely messed around so much inconvenience ringing, emailing, online etc. Didnt bill me in the end but they need to look at their app sliders and barsMade a mistake on their app. Used the bars and sliders and couldnt work out which one was yes/no. Really confusing.Got charged £46 instead of £12 and they lad i spoke to tried to remove the charges as i hadnt used any of the data and records showed i was having problems.  Offered 10% off so i closed my 3 accounts with them. £429 a year theyre happy to lose for £36. Shocking middle management.  Ill never again use vodafone",1
"I need a replacement pay as you go SIM card and went online to order one. No facility to do that. Have to chat  to an advisor. Can't, because they don't have any. At all. None. No advisors at all. Because of Coronavirus. So I give them a ring. No advisors. At all. Because of Coronavirus. Go into a store? Nearest is 20 miles away. And why should I?Suffix: I did finally get through to an advisor, who was excellent. The new nano-SIM to replace my mini-SIM is arriving within a couple of days. So a good result.BUT come on, Vodafone, by now you should have this all sorted with advisors WFH if necessary. 'Coronavirus' is no longer an adequate excuse for under-resourced customer services.",1
Been with Vodafone for a good few years with no problems but now I think is a Joke of a company when all I want is to add the apple watch to my account.UPDATE after 5 days of emails and a big fat headache I have finally got an email saying I can have the watch that I wanted but it's now on back order which it was not the first day I tried to order one. So really I will have waited 10-12 days just to get an apple watch which is a sad amount of time messing about3 days have passed and still Vodafone has not sent a stock up like email says this is getting beyond a joke. A mate applied for the same item today and is getting his apple watch delivered tomorrow. Joke joke joke,1
Vodaphone treats Channel Islands as an International Destination and charges accordingly which is ridiculous or a deliberate rip-off. For £3/month you can have 100 free minutes to 100 international destinations around the world but the Channel Islands is not included in this list despite being only 150 miles away - this tends to confirm it is a deliberate policy to maximise earnings.,1
"I got my phone+sim plan on Carphone warehouse. Vodafone was the one I picked and during 2 years, I never had any complaint, to be honest. Good signal, very clear bills and internet speed was good.But after 2 years, my contract ended and I received a phone call asking if I wanted to renew.Since I wanted the Samsung S20 but the price was higher than what I could afford, I was told that I could do a SIM-only plan and upgrade after 3 months to add a phone. Note that the employee didn't mislead me.The problem is that now, I went to check the upgrade plans for a new phone (S20 for example) and if I do an upgrade, I will pay more 200 pounds at the end of 2 years, compared to if I got a new plan.The problem is that I am stuck in a 2 years contract...where I am losing, and any new customer for Vodafone gets better deals than me that I am a customer for 2+ years.Loyalty not only means nothing to Vodafone, also it seems they laugh at your face by having awful prices for ""loyal"" customers and great prices for whoever is a potential customer.Once I finish the 2 years, I will change to another operator that hasn't played me around like this.So people, you know it, is your first plan? maybe accept. Renew? Don't be a fool like me....",1
"So this review is really just to warn Vodafone and their customers, my wife ordered an Ipad with Vodafone and it was delivered by DPD and their driver left it lying on my front doorstep for anyone to steal. I was lucky that a neighbour took it in, but it made me wonder how many other parcels he left on peoples doorsteps. Totally disgusting.",1
"After giving Vodafone a bad review last time, they have been very helpful with a problem with intermittent broadband, which is down to a fault on the line,its obvious as the phone doesn't work!!!I just find it stupid when you ring up to speak to someone about broadband not working you get a recorded message to say its quicker to go onlinewhen you cant go online GRRR",1
I bought the sim card advertise 15 GB Data and 250 min  sim card arrive late even than they give 500mb data a day and daily usage £1 its a joke someone legally selling online sim card display 15gb data and 250 min for £10 month  once you buy they put on sim plan only . and even than they overcharge on daily plan . than they refund after long argument.very bad companythat is ripe off in day light . this complain will fwd to offcom .cusservice people hang the phone once i call them in first call . they promise manager will call you in 24hrs 48 hrs gone no one call so far  again call they put request to speed up and someone call you still pending .Know they call me and give me bundle as i paid for.but gone through lot of issue once it actually arrive finally.,1
"It has taken months to get my speed problem fixed, though I realise COVID and OpenReach should bear a lot of the responsibility. Even so (this accounting for the 3 stars), their service personnel are excellent, friendly, efficient, apologetic!! I was particularly impressed by Kirsty and Mohammed Saif -- their service skills are outstanding.",1
"pretty good broadband and mobile contract, useless customer service.had a problem while switching broadband, they prosponed connection date by 2 weeks then the offer i was signing up for expired. they put me on a contract that was 50% more expensive including the bonus i got for being an existing mobile customer. after 2 months i was refunded but most of the customer service people could not help, then by strike of luck i got through to someone who did know what they were doing. None of the previous conversations were noted on account but im just happy its sorted.the broadband is exactly what i now payed for and never had a problem with the mobile side of things.",1
"Ehab was so helpful! I’ve been having problems with bringing my phone number over from an old sim to my new one (hence the 3 stars due to delays and previous customer service experience when calling to ask how to swap it). I called the complaints department and was put through to Ehab, the most cheerful, patient and helpful person I’ve ever spoken to on the phone. I called looking for actual help not to complain about the problem which I’m sure they get a lot. The problem is not yet solved but hopefully will be in the next 24hours. Just wanted to let the company know what an asset they have in him.",1
"I can say i'm a fairly new Vodafone user, and their customer service has been good so far, with one exception of an incident.. that was mostly due to a misunderstanding. Still, gotta be cautious with my rating.",1
"I mean, not that bad...",1
I have been frustrated with my signal in London for a while now and no matter how many times I call the helpline nothing changes.,1
So far on accepting order seems good will review when service active surely they cannot be as bad as a BT company rep saying BT equipment and company crap,1
The broadband is incredibly unstable. We had no issues with previous supplier so really regret switching to Vodafone now. They're also not responding to my complaint. Avoid.*Update: to be fair to Vodafone they've since kept in weekly touch with us to try and resolve this for us.  Matter still ongoing at the moment.,1
"I have been a Vodafone customer for the past five years. It's ok, but not great. Customer service could be better especially waiting time. But overall ok service.",1
"Been with Vodafone for 14year (mobile). Just upgraded, the rep gave me 40% discount which was a mistake on their behalf. But they tried to get me to pay for their mistake. After a lot of phone calls and telling me customer services would phone me back at a certain time, they would phone me at the wrong time, eg at work the next day. In the end they gave me 30% off and the difference for the 24 month contract. So got to thank you. Because it got sorted hopefully will continue with them as I have never had a problem with them before. Their fair if you set your case.",1
"Website has been trashed, can no longer easily set up payment methods, i cancelled 2 mobile broadband numbers and nothing actually happened their side, had to call up again a month later and ask the same thing again. The customer support needs sorting out or self service online website like before.",1
Recent great customer service from a Melissa.  She had gone way beyond expections and due to me being a penisioner it was very hard.  Warmst regards from myself and Mrs Jones.  Just wish there was a easier way to get through.,1
"Used Vodafone broadband for two landlines. Similar experience with bothThe Good:No problems with router and broadband service was reliable throughoutThe Bad:During activation, messed up the landline numbers for numbers I've had for years. Why ?  I've switched between BT, EE, PlusNet and TalkTalk before with no messing up of landline numbers. But Vodafone seem to do it :-(  To their credit they eventually restored the old numbers but I spent several days with a different landline number which means friends with your old number cannot call you and two factor authentication call back services (e.g. HMRC) are non-operational until the old phone numbers get restored. Other providers simply don't cause this hassle - why do Vodafone when they also use the BT OpenReach networkBilling system charges for services that Vodafone no longer supply. In two cases Vodafone generated bills for services that were already out of contract and had already been switched and transitioned to another supplier. In case #1 they said the next bill would credit the overpayment -- it didn't, it simply carried on billing for the service no longer being provided -- so more complaints. In case #2 the exact same story -- the next bill will be a credit -- except it is not a credit, it simply carries on billing. This billing practice is shocking -- I wonder how many other people are simply being billed when they switched away long ago ?Complaints line only seems to handle mobile complaints. Broadband is ""another department"". Took 5 phone calls and 2 disconnections to get through to make a complaint and various tall tales were provided about me having to request refunds from my new broadband provider and having to provide Vodafone 30-days notification when switching despite OFCOM rules clearly saying otherwise. Again, simply shockingSummary: Broadband OK, but initial setup and billing when you move away are sub-standard. My goodness you need to watch these supposedly reputable suppliers",1
"I have mainly enjoyed saving more on their rewards system than paying in bill, but my personal win aside they are just ok Tobi inside their app is just useless and don't bother with one of there advisors as they won't tell you anything useful. Was given three different pieces of information on whether my plan had roaming inside the eu but they have not been as bad as some other companies I have dealt with recently.",1
"I have to say, as being “tech-Savy” I am appalled at how firstly, customer service is and secondly, why you won’t return my call or reply to my emails about my bill. This is now 2 months bills that I’ve gained extra charges for abroad (when haven’t left UK since Oct 2019)Disappointed as I have been with your provider since I was 19.",1
"Data is good everything is good except from the call quality, the call quality is really vague and not crisp quality compared to other networks",1
"Latest Review (three-and-a-half stars)The company answered my questions forthrightly over the phone and also put the price down from what it was, which was a nice surprise, the service now being (substantially more) worth the monthly cost.Technical-wise, the internet has been impressive, able as we are now, to stream without interference, the BBC at best-quality, sometimes, and (not a fan of...) Amazon Prime at best-quality.Am hoping to implement call-forwarding, in attempts to try out different routes for connection, and if everything goes as well as it currently does, am thinking it might work.No reason to change company as-of-yet and am pleased to have stuck around for the long-haul.The deficit in the star-rating is the issue of mobile-phone protocols: on 3G-only phones, you cannot be on the internet and a call at the same time (why I am trying call-divert), which does not allow for the fact that some people use older phones.Older Review (company had two stars)In trying to think of positive things to say about the public sector and PLCs and communication companies of the private sector, have found it immensely difficult.This particular mini-dictatorship does at least provide fast enough speeds behind the hype. And as such, am able to stream live-TV using Mobile Hotspotting.However, those who take up the helm in the handling of customer queries (in particular, those higher up the ladder-of-ambition, snugly buckled into their Imperial Fleet seating arrangements), unfortunately do not seemingly have any business training, personable skills or sense of ethics under their belt to undertake such bouts and in doing so deliver way under an acceptable standard in these areas, whilst making efforts to conceal attempts at enforcing the dark-side.The company does as such:They advertise Unlimited Mobile services and yet the services are very much limited -1. Wildly fluctuating downloads speeds - down to minimal speeds (they do pick up as well; hence the two-star rating)2. Huge latency figures (a known issue)3. Bandwidth that is so narrow that one cannot make a phone-call and be on the internet at the same time4. Dystopian rule (we are not sons and daughters of their clonèd regime)Personal experiences:When asking for a 'letter of deadlock' was told that a gratuity they had GIVEN and of which I made sure - in writing - was a gift-of-no-clauses, stated they would retrieve the fifty-pounds (already-banked) by force if I requested a 'letter of deadlock' in order to take the company up on the bandwidth issue.They came up with the resolution, to grant a piece of equipment that might help to widen the bandwidth and after I checked with their technical team as to whether this equipment would actually sort out the problem, and to which I received an affirmative, the offer was retracted, Vodafone continuing to refuse making satisfaction.Their advertising does not stipulate that Mobile Hotspotting will consist of poor performance but instead makes out that one is getting a super package for the price when in fact the amount is approaching the price for a broadband and phone deal that some (other) companies offer.I am fairly convinced that there is deliberate and secret capping of services as the company tries to push customers onto broadband deals instead of the monthly sim-deal accounts because line-broadband deals make more money, i.e:- instead of being an all-inclusive phone and internet deal, customers that are paying for a line-connection (with Vodafone) would have to pay equal to monthly mobile phone and internet prices for broadband-internet alone...plus...whatever else for a phone-line. Many-a-time told there would manifest some kind of resolution, advertising literature for broadband would instead be thrown at me.After having been kept in an online chat for about five to six hours, any ideas whatsoever as to some kind of resolution were voided, except for the (repeated) solution - not initially linked with this complaint - put forward in particular by those representing the company's CEO, to leave the contract free of charge.The problem comes down to the fact that these companies do not respect the duty in their hands to deliver a high standard of service because they do not value the technology that is in their hands at the outset - wrong people in the wrong jobs.Essentially, we are talking about professional advertising that masks back-street trading.",1
Okish the best and customer service is average,1
"3* for broadband but 0* for all else!Warning: Vodafone deny all responsibility for missing Amazon vouchers!I applied to Vodafone January 2020 because of their well advertised £100 Amazon voucher offer with the claim that I'd receive an email after 120 days for such a voucher.120 days have passed and whilst the fiber broadband has been acceptable (not really surprising because ultimately it's BT that provides the connectivity infrastructure and so that's not physically changed from when I switched from Sky), no Amazon voucher was forthcoming.This was despite it being clearly advertised on the first page of the Vodafone application journey.Having queried this initially with Vodafone they were initially very helpful and indicated the date at which 120 days is met.This however came and went, so my subsequent web chat with Vodafone resulted in them effectively denying all responsibility for the missing voucher - despite it clearly being shown as part of **their** application process; instead trying to suggest that because the offer was provided by the website *from which** I clicked to get into the Vodafone website!In fact they also claimed the offer was non-existent at the time!I don't think that just because the deal was shown on the MoneySavingExpert.com website from which I clicked though to the Vodafone website to apply is at all responsible for honoring the voucher code somehow!Either way it is completely unacceptable for my to chase a voucher that formed part of the original application and thus my contact with them!UPDATE: 06/06/2020 - After getting in touch with Vodafone, and writing this review, and also then chasing the 3rd party voucher provider Vodafone mentioned during my complaint, surprise surprise I received an email from the 3rd party company within hours! Not sure what happened to resolve this, apart from my frustration in having to chase this up myself, but I have increased this review from 2* to 3* as my complaint is now fully resolved; still - I shouldn't have had to complain in the first place (hence no higher rating!)",1
I am grateful that there are people like Masry (a person who works for Vodafone). We just signed a contract with this company and we had two problems that he was very good at solving. Happily there are still people like Masry doing their job properly.,1
"Nothings ever straight forward with them, never get signal, horrible customer service, only reason I have left 3 stars is that they are very cheap",1
"I've been with vodafone for a couple of year now. Great service for data and text's, had a few issue's with calls in the home. not always working.My Main gripe with vodafone is that there customer service has no empathy when you can't pay your bill due to the on going crisis that the world is experiencing in which my job was no longer available and i ended up on benefits. After contacting vodafone if they could reduce my plan and help me to manage my bill's during this particular time, all i got was upselling me with new products. Now for me i'm struggling to pay my phone bill, why would i buy more products from yourselves.On top of this, constantly getting daily SMS's after i have spoken to Vodafone customer service with a 'Promise to Pay'.I believe Vodafone customer service needs work to keep there customer's happy and loyal.",1
"Absolute nightmare. I went for a simple upgrade via chat and they placed the wrong order. Since January I've been trying to fix it. Contacted them several times. I've spoken with at least 15 customer services representatives and spent at least 10 hours. Every time they say ""don't worry. I'll fix it"" and every time they fail. I was suppose to pay £17 a month and I ended up paying £27. It's all in the chat logs that I saved. And every time they agree it has to be fixed but they don't fix it.Update: June 2020. I've been contacted by a complaint team and they provided a solution that is acceptable. This has been fixed for now but it took me months to fix.",1
"Overall my experience with Vodafone has been pretty good. The service is great, and the prices aren’t too bad.However when it comes to telephone customer service, there is much to be improved upon. For instance I phoned up to enquire about why I had additional charges on my bill and the person I spoke too could barely understand let alone speak English... honestly. Some staff who are not completely clueless and actually understand what is being said would be a great addition.",1
"After reading some reviews about Vodafone I thought I would share my experience with you.I have been with vodafone mobile for 15 + years as they are one of the best in my area all thou I have had signal issues over the most of those years even in my house,after lots of calls to vf over the years they supplied me with a sure signal box free of charge and that made my phone calls from home better,still have issues from time to time around my local area.How ever after years of being with EE broadband I decided to try vf as they was doing a decent deal.Set up was pretty easy and all went well to start with then ,things started to change after a few months the broadband speed and connectivity was good but wifi issues started accruing wifi keeps dropping and it will not reach my garden,(never had any issues with EE ). I have phoned vf many times about it and all though the staff are very helpful  it is some time a nightmare to get hold of,they have talked me through a few changes to my settings to try and sort thinks out and they seem to work for so long and then back to drop wifi issues and sometimes I have to re-enter my pass word to reconnect on numerous occasions it keeps telling me I have entered my password wrong, sometimes I have to enter two or three time before it excepts the code,the last time I spoke to vf they advised me they they don't guarantee wifi signal which was a bit of a blow as I have never had any problems with EE. Roll on to the end of my broadband contract with vf so I can try someone else.If I get a reply from vf team please do not ask me to contact them on social Media as I do not use any of these platforms.",1
"Contemplated between 3 and 4 stars and would like to explain. Originally myself &hubby took out mobile + internet for 18 months which ended in Feb 2020 and they did't contact us to discuss extension. Original set up of broadband and billing was a nightmare (what was agreed vs what was billed) and some friends had same experience, but sorted our eventually but ONE GREAT thing was that for 20 months we didn't receive silly post every 6 months stating our bill will go up by 10% (as it was with horrific Virgin Media). ONE BAD thing is that my husband doesn't have work phone and had to use his phone for work in March (during pandemic) forgetting he had 500 minutes/month in phone calls he never came close to using! One day he receives a warning text saying he exceeded his normal £10/month bill by £90!!! After some persuasion (and calls) they reduced the bill by £50. This unfortunate experience brings us to ANOTHER GOOD THING is their customer service who were working from home (disjointed broadband and mobile departments) after a long call managed to pull it together and get us a renewed contract for further 18 months at a bargain price (broadband + mobile). TalkTalk and NowTV have problems with answering to customers and don't have people working from home it seems! THIRD GOOD THING is that we got my 91-year old father-in-law a SIM ONLY (UK only) unlimited minutes on his mobile for only £8/month. The cheapest deal and perfect to know the price is fixed! GOOD overall, but need some improvement on initial account set-up and more collaboration between mobile/broadband departments.",1
"Their phone service in terms of signal and 4G reception is very good.Their business retention model is awful however. My contract came to an end and I tried to negotiate one of the packages they offer through third party agents but was told that I couldn’t do so and only got offered their standard packages with a 15% discount.I turned them down and asked for my PAC number so that I could take my number elsewhere. That part went smoothly.I signed up to Asda on a 30 day SIM only deal that was much cheaper and provided much more data with the same service, home or abroad as offered by Vodafone - but for £5.00 a month cheaper than Vodafone’s best discounted offer to me.I considered trying their cheaper sister company VOXI but the reviews were off putting, especially if you were porting a number. I also cannot understand how VOXI can provide a roaming service abroad, but Vodafone basics doesn’t. Work that one out - they are fundamentally the same company after all.To summarise; I got more data, the same call and text limit - international roaming etc, plus an efficient UK based Call Centre, all for £5.00 a month less than Vodafone’s best bespoke deal  - with a 30 day contract and even kept my mobile number.",1
"They're alright.Seem to have one of the mobile best networks in the UK - can get decent signal even in the middle of nowhere. But their prices are simply more expensive than their competitors, you only get a decent deal when you threaten to leave, and even the guy that was meant to try and convince me to stay agreed and owned up to also having a contract with the provider I was switching to.Their support isn't great, but it's no worse than their competitors.",1
"Decent customer service, one person did straight up lie to me, but other department were very good at keeping up communication.Service itself is subpar, found far more consistency with o2, but still the service has been much better than EE at least in my experience in the UK. Prices don't help this out any.",1
"As a family we have had mobile accounts with Vodafone for many years.  We spend a great deal of time in Turkey and the fact that the country was on Vodafone's 'roam free' list (and no other UK provider does this) was the principle reason we had been loyal to them.  So when they announced in March that they would be removing Turkey from the list it came as a bit of a shock.  A quick calculation showed that it was going to cost me up to £1500 a year to stay connected when abroad.  I rang Customer Service in disgust, adamant to let them know how cross I was, before moving all my accounts.  The gentleman was very calm and understanding.  He said that because I was a 'long standing' customer they could place all my phones onto some form of 'special account' that meant I could keep the free roaming in Turkey.  Oh here we go, I thought, he's trying to sell me a bolt on.In fact it's actually worked out cheaper than before!  Why they couldn't have just done that automatically without me having to get enraged I don't really know.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for 8 years but I am now moving to another mobile network.My experience with Vodafone has actually been quite good. I have no major complaints.I would say that the monthly phone contracts on Vodafone with a handset are slightly dearer than other networks. However, the RED bundle is great value for money as it comes with a choice of various entertainment packs (Sky Sports, Spotify, etc).I was also given a substantial discount on my current contract which I would not have been able to afford otherwise. I felt extremely valued as a customer who had been with them for so long. Unfortunately, I do not believe they offer this kind of discount anymore.The mobile phone coverage has never let me down. As I have no first-hand experience with any other network, I am unable to give a direct comparison. But e.g. at concerts, my friends' would often be unable to get 4G but I never found myself in that situation. Extremely reliable from my experience.However, the only minor annoyance when I was told that I should wait until or around the date of my termination to transfer my number over to another network, otherwise I may get charged an early termination fee (ETF). I was told this around 3 weeks before my contract came to an end. I had my eye on an extremely good mobile phone deal at the time but I did not want to risk having to pay the ETF so I waited. Unfortunately, the deal quickly disappeared. I called Vodafone again 2 weeks later only to find out that whoever had informed me about the ETF was wrong and that I would be okay if I transferred my number at any point as I had already paid all that was due.A slightly disappointing end.",1
Last night I received my PAC code from Vodafone and they said if I stick with Vodafone I can get up to 30% off and gave me a link to chat. I clicked to chat and went through security then I was told that I needed to speak to another department so I was passed on immediately and spoke to someone else after going through security again I discussed the offer I had off sky mobile and the discount from Vodafone so we discussed that and I was told I needed to speak to another department and could take up to 20 minutes to get through. 35 minutes later I finally got to talk to somebody. She told me the best she could offer was £49 per month (despite speaking to of of their partner companies earlier in the day and I was given £43). After a lengthy discussion and being told she couldn’t do any better she said that there is another department who can possibly give be a better offer. This was 2 HOURS after I started speaking with them. I was not happy but eventually I agreed to speak to the other department. The 4th person I spoke to was called Rachel and within a few minutes after going through security for a 4th time and over 2 hours of chatting with them I was given the following offer:iPhone 1124g dataUnlimited callsUnlimited texts12 months insuranceCan upgrade after 12 months1 year subscription to apply TV£42 per monthTWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER I ended the chat after speaking with 4 different people. I got a decent offer but it should not have taken that amount of time!,1
Terrible customer care unless you speak to a human. I tried to cancel my contract but took nearly an hour on the 'chat' service and they were useless - I got nowhere. So I tried to get hold of someone human and she was great. It was concluded quickly.So my tip - speak to a human.,1
"Disappointing! As a long-term customer Vodafone mobile there was little incentive to get broadband with them. The offer was not attractive including having to lose my  landline telephone number and hanging around for an engineer to call. TalkTalk could just do it directly, so I would be able to keep my landline number and would have no need for an engineer to call round.",1
Disgusting service. They eventually admit they made a mistake which has marked my credit file and have spend the last 12 months chasing them to fix it and pay the compensation they promised. Now I have just been told since my account is closed I cannot be given any compensation at all. What a joke they were happy to send my information to a debt collector twice and not even attempt a call to me when their mistake made them think I owed them! Not so quick to cough money up when it’s the other way round. They’ll happily take your hard earned money with any excuse but put barriers up when giving it back. Hypocrites-- Update --I forgot all about this but it did eventually get sorted once through to a complaints staff member based here in the UK. This team seemed a lot more willing to help and a lot less shrouded in processes. took them two 15 minute calls to sort and then confirm they had corrected my credit file. so I've updated my score a little to reflect the good staff that they do have. I suspect its more a case of process being crap rather that the people,1
"I have had a Vodafone mobile contract for years and years and my package works well for me (sim only).Staff at my local shop our helpful and pleasant.Where it all goes wrong is in customer services and accounts.Talking to someone in India is potluck if they understand your issues with phone and/or account.I was tricked into automatic payments when they asked on line if I wanted my card details to be saved. I asked for that to be undone, but to no avail. Then I got a message this month that my bill was not paid, although on the bill it states that it will be taken from my account. Totally crap and annoying.",1
"Positives:Good 4G speed & respectable roaming countries (not as many as 3 but better than the other networks)Good PAYG rewardsNegatives:Customer service is never in sync, they don’t seem to log the important parts of a call so you always have to explain the issue all over again to another person!Indoor service is hit and miss",1
Home wifi is seriously not good enough. Sort it out Vodafone.,1
"Been with Vodafone 12m, leaving as they are increasing the tariff inside the 18 month contract I originally took out. It's not a big price increase but the service has dropped dramatically in the last 4 months and there are much better offers out there at the moment. We stream Netflix and have our mobile phones connected to the wifi for the baby monitor, no gaming etc so nothing really hammering the resource.Netflix (via amazon firetv) repeatedly cuts out/freezes/disconnects and when it does come back on, can be painfully slow to reload and results in a very pixelated picture. The signal has also seemed to decrease in range - cuts out in rooms where it was fine.Wifi on the mobile phone can cut out throughout the day and also the TV so it's not an evening/heavy use period problem.Customer service (via chat) on the occasion I did contact them were relatively helpful. I've generally had no issues up until the service getting so much worse. Quite glad to have the tariff increase to release me from my contract!",1
not a bad deal. spoke with 3 teams to manage my switch. got there in the end.,1
"My experience with Vodafone Customer Service both in the UK and off-shore was poor. From scaremongering tactics regarding the life of handsets to a very uncaring attitude towards a loyal customer of many years.All that changed when I contacted the CEO of Vodafone, Nick Jeffrey, whose email address is easily obtainable on-line. The matter was handled really well by Caleb Schofield of their Executive Team. He actually cared about customer retention and went above and beyond.You shouldn’t have to go to those lengths but clearly it works.",1
"I have Vodafone broadband, phone, mobile, ipad... that is it!  They usually deliver good service.  Their customer care is a sad, sad case though! Barely any indoor signal, yet they argue with me that miles away on a little computer they see I should have good phone signal...not gotten through to them as yet",1
(Irish Customer) (POSTED HERE DUE TO NO REPLIES FROM IRISH BRANCH) Paying 55 euro a month for 250 gb mobile broadband and over the last few months speeds have been dropping like crazy up until a few days ago the network was just about usable. Now im getting speeds as low as 0.09 mbps. And ive reported it to support every other day and im told your problem is being forwarded to out technical team. And there has still been no improvement. Reason for the 3 stars is due to there being the odd 2 or 3 support workers that were genuinely nice and tried to help as best they could. Which is a lot better than i can say for the rest. Service needs to be improved in areas where 4G may not be so easily accesible and customer support needs a complete re-do. (WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD REPLY VIA E-MAIL ETC...) And thank you for your time.,1
Mediocre phone company that add too many hidden extras.,1
"I like Vodafone for some points and I hate Vodafone for other points. About over month ago I was disconnected ( few min after I paid my bill, and I have 4 items so pay a lots ). All day I was calling 191 and been promised that they will connect me back in 2 hours in 15 minutes. Non of agent was helpful. They said technical problem . Next day all the same I called 191 over 10 times and nothing happened. Eventually I upgraded me plan what make me connect again so I done myself as they was to stupid to doit. They give some compensation apologies for being useless and unhelpful. Anyway 2 weeks ago I placed order for iPhone 11 and iwatch 5. Day after I desited to cancel order iPhone but keep watch and change watch from trade in offer just to normal without giving my old watch back. Women on the phone, well not just her because I called few times as I did not received any email confirmation, so they all guaranteed that iPhone 11 order is cancel and watch will not have to be trade in. I was shocked when week later iphone 11 arrived and week later watch with envelope for old watch to trade in. So all upside down. When I called man on the phone was yawn and can’t help. Anyway I think Vodafone are ok but all these agents from 191 are pathetic lier and don’t know the job. I rather go to shop then talk with these horrible agents. Even while they talk they not put interest or any attention and do everything wrong . How bad customer service how agent ca yawn or other was eating I can clearly hear . Is so bad .",1
"They falsely advertise their broadband speeds, speeds might be 15-40mbps although they advertise 55 minimum guaranteed. Their money back guarantee is only a discount of 15%.They can’t even keep their paperwork in check, I spent half day calling them going to Vodafone centre to prove that my contract says that I can cancel 30 days after my installation. Still don’t get it why I had to prove them that because they should have a copy of my contract.Long story short their broadband is **** their customers support is even worse and they can’t even get their paper work in check.Edit:ill bump it up to 3 stars because of  their Directors office response to my online complain, where they understood what was the issue and that it was an unusual case due to my contract setup date and instillation date being unusually far apart in which time they changed their return policy",1
"I had to wait almost 40 minutes on the phone for just a simple enquiry ,but they did eventually sort things out. I just think they need more people manning the phone lines!",1
As long as you don’t have a problem Vodafone is a great network. If you have a problem it will take ages to get through which is seriously annoying. Then you either get a fantastic PERSON or someone who doesn’t have a clue or gives darn who or what you want.,1
"I've had a decent experience from their supply of coverage, but when coming to upgrade their costs are just far too high in comparison to others. Should value their existing customers more than simply trying to bring in new ones.",1
"not good, not bad. was in Europe for a trip and use this one. I think this kind of service must be cheaper",1
"So I have two mobile phone contracts and a home broadband contract with Vodafone and I'll start with the first mobile.Mobile 1 for my son was due an upgrade so we called to see what could be offered as I spend quite a bit with vodafone. No offer of discount was forthcoming to match EE prices so we took out a contract with EE, there was a little more time on the vodafone contract to run which I was happy to sacrifice when moving over.  Note: corporately I can get 20% with EE (previously my employer was with vodafone and they too gave 20%) but I've been a loyal customer for more years than I can remember so have stayed with them.I recently called to give the 30 day notice to cancel the contract foe mobile 1 and there was the retrospective offer from the cancellations team oops too late for that now new contracts signed and out of cool off period .Over to mobile 2, I see you have another phone, do you want to upgrade? I'm not quite due one yet, that's ok said the operator we can sort that out for you. A variety of plans were mentioned and then the unlimited plan along with a 20% discount was offered which was very interesting indeed.  I gratefully took this offer up.I'm now two weeks later and the whole area that i live in has home broadband connection problems.This is not normally an issue as I would tether from my mobile. This is where what I thought was a fantastic deal, was far from it. My mobile speeds have dropped at least 30mbs making working from home ridiculously difficult. After being on the phone for the faults relating to the home broadband I then spoke to the customer service team to discuss hope they can rectify the speeds, 3 teams later and my options are1. Upgrade to the max unlimited plan, current discount will not be applied2.  downgrade my plan to what I previously had, this has a discount applied and will be retained. No mention of returning handsetor3.  return my handset and go back to my old contract.I will be returning my handset and when the appropriate time comes along will be cancelling all my contracts with Vodafone.I'm not asking for much  just a reasonable speed on a phone contact that I still pay quite a sum for. Returning the phone will also mean I have a branded, new case that is of no use to me, for now.So a phone call that took more than 40 minutes to a customer services teams, with no willingness to retain a customer, is 40 minutes I'll never get back and Vodafone has lost another customer. Whether this is a result of their systems being inflexible or  the people being inflexible I'll never know.23rd July updateI went in my lunch break to The Lock, Swindon with the intent on handing back my phone, the assistant listened to my experience over the weekend with Vodaphones customer service teams and to cut a long story short, with authorisation from the regional manager, I retained my original 20% discount and my speed upgraded.  So credit goes to the assistant that actually listened to me, sorry I do not know his name but thank you very much. The team over the phones really should take a leaf out of his book on how to treat loyal customers. If I could give an independent score for the assistant in Swindon he would look get a 5 star rating.",1
Phoned to enquire about changing to another provider once this contract ran out as they had better offer. Agent said he could give me a quote to see if I would stay. Okay and he quoted me a deal on the phone I wanted for 45 a month. More then the other provider but close enough I said ok for loyalty sake. Within 20 minutes I got confirmation email saying phone works be sent out for contract at 53 a month. Phoned to point out the mistake to be told the agent gave me the wrong price. They checked the phone call and yes I had been quoted 45.... Got put through to numerous different teams with each time the story well get it sorted... Almost 2 hours later.... No we won't honour the quote...I shall take business elsewhere...Update - The complaint team phoned me back and a very nice man offered his sincere apologies for what he could understand was not great customer service....very nice man as said....then he suggested he put me  through to their resolution team to see what offer they could make on back of this experience....ok.....waited in queue to then get a person quote me exact same price i was complaining about....give them their due...they stick to their guns and will not budge an inch ...i'll go elsewhere where cheaper offers from Vodafone abound for 3rd party suppliers...but not for 'valued' customersUpdate  - ok got a phone call from another sales team person.... Apparently not connected to my above gripe.... Anyway he offered me a much better offer on a new phone... Not quite what was offered before but very near... Person was very polite ... To be honest they have all been very polite... So I have accepted and updated my stars to reflect my restoration in customer service given.....Update...after a few months i looked at the details of my package on phone app....turns out the packaged offered by above was not what i was given....yet again they lied about what they could offer...Update - Eventually got through to someone who listened to my story and fixed there and then....updated my account to what was initially offered and added a discount for my troubles....if only all experiences were like this.....from sound of it call was offshore (i guess India??) but the lady was top notch and so helpful...so i update stars to 3......shame it took so many attempts to get someone who bothered to take the time to help and knew what they were doing....which other staff  clearly didnt.,1
If you have a problem with Vodafone Broadband or mobile and you mention it here it looks like you have to be on Twitter or Facebook to get an answer from Vodafone. I'm not on those two platforms and I have no interest in signing up to get what probably won't be an answer to a problemUpdate:Hey yourselfIt would be nice if you could mention some of the more old fashioned ways to contact you going forward. (in the future),1
"I had broadband with vodafone for a couple of months. Then I was moving out so we used the transfer of ownership. Apparently, we had to fill in the form a couple of time, give them multiple phone calls, and even then they charged both of us. After that, they told me that the money is now on the vodafone acount, so that's all sorted. But I could not get it back. I had to wait another month. After many chat online, phone calls, around 5 redirections, I finally now was told that I will get my money back by the end of the next week. Just imagine.EDIT: I've updated to 3 stars to reflect the stability of the internet when I lived there. The internet was always meeting its minimum of 52mb.",1
"Unfortunately I just changed Broadband and phone provider to this company. The Broadband switch website reviews were quite positive, so stupidly I ignored Trustpilot. Thought I was going with a quality reputable brand - my god I wish I'd stayed with BT no issues there. Wifi is SLOW, their router/modem poor, I can't link up my TP Link powerlines and can't use my TP link fast modem/router - they will not let you use a third party router/modem - despite telling me you could pre purchase and a couple of 'technical support' giving details of how to setup. Their lamentable support stops at 9pm and is based in Egypt (which is fair enough if it was actually open). Basically a totally incompetent provider.I have updated this from 1 star to 3. Having put in two complaints and posted on here they got in touch at work to resolve. However today I just phoned TP Link  who were brilliant in terms of setting up the router. On the Vodafone box things did improve a little but it is poor quality, I could not get our TV's or TP Link to access it at all and the signal was weak / less than poor.I understand the approach of not supporting a third party router - its pretty obvious ship instructions for third party routers if a customer opts for them - even if they need to setup with router company. They should have 24/7 support in day and age and make sure their staff actually are trained on the product/options.",1

"I went into shop asking for a simple payasugo sim, the saleasman said I could have one for free, he then added a contract to my account for over £21 a month, I have lost count of the diferent deparments I have been passed too, they promised to cancel it, but I still get bills, I will stick to a simple payasgo infuture and would not sign up with vodaphone again, the lied to tie me into a contract I never ordered and nothing but aggrevation trying to get out of itupdate after reply, complaint has been resolved, I did not sign anything though, but thanks for reply, had been happy with Vodaphone up until then",1

I would like to update my review. Since writing my review and spending over an hour speaking to the sales manager and writing a letter and HAVING TO MAIL IT THROUGH THE POST CERTIFIED I received a call from Vodafone and I think the problems have been solved. it was a nightmare but hopefully thanks to the amazing Sales Manager things should be good now.Thank you!!!!,1
"Generally if you call other mobiles in UK within the bundle is cheap ( like I pay10 GBP for 250 min a month + unlimited text and 2 GB data).if you want to call a landline or a line that starts with 02 then they start charge you additional and is not part of the minutes you already paid for. the charge for that call is very high and if you got additional credit like 5 or 10 pounds in your account you can make barely one call as they charge over half pound per min for such calls which is absolutely ridiculous, more importantly, they don't tell you that these calls are not covered by your monthly bundle.However there are solution to that , unfortunately not through Vodafone, I bought JustVoip and through that you can make free calls to number that starts with 02there coverage here in Medway is gooddata speed is good as wellroaming in Europe is very good as its considered as moving in UK",1
"Fairly new customer, had some bad experiences with o2 and 3, so hopeful Vodafone will prove better. Feel it was a bit rogue to hide my line rental, when I was led to believe I would be paying £20 a month all in. Suppose all companies are out for your money, perhaps they will prove to be the best of a bad lot.",1
"Product is good, communication can be better.",1
Really difficult to engage with from a rural location. However once you get through to the right person it's an okay service. They wont use email which is a big down point,1
"One of the best UK providers, been with them over  6 years and have had good experience except when it came to upgrades and price matching its contenders. Today as I write this my number is being ported over to O2 because nobody at Vodafone retentions wanted me or three of my other family members to stay with them. Not saying they did not try to retain us, they tried really poorly.After 6 long years leaving on a bad note is probably thier only negative. Their customer service is ace and beats anyone else out there. Stick to it if you can find pocket friendly options. Service for data and call quality are way better than other providers too.But once again loyalty with them DOES NOT PAY so be prepared.",1
Would be 5 stars but their pricing is high. Love that I can use my phone globally,1
Good:Network works fine.Price for the whole contract.Bad:Technical customer service was poor.Not able to set spending cap on app.Useless additional services switched on by default.,1
"TBH i have been a loyal VF customer for many years but i see none of that loyalty reflected back? I do see new customers getting much better deals than me, which really grates on me and makes it feel VF are taking me for granted...do not!.I am due a 'scheduled' upgrade right now but the deals are in no way rewarding, small data offers show little respect for my prolonged loyalty. My actual contract expire in 10 weeks, it is likely i am  leaving VF and i have already requested my unlock code. Give me a Huawei P20 lite (Blue), 1gb data and whatever mins and texts for a 'valued and well  deserved' loyal customer price p/m.Now balance is mitigated but here it is, to be fair, respect where it's due, coverage has never ever been a concern and having lived in a small village, only VF worked out there, so well done VF.I have encountered staff/service difficulties in-store relating to setting up my partners new VF contract phone, costing us 4 visits to the city centre store to finally have it resolved.Make me feel respected and valued VF?",1
"I'd been with Vodafone as a PAYG customer for many years and wanted a SIM only monthly contract.  Despite Vodafone's best efforts and mine they couldn't match one from Virgin so I asked for a PUC and switched.  Because I was in credit when I left Vodafone I asked for a refund after switching. I went through various levels of Customer Service only to be told it wasn't possible, often for a different reason each time.I'm a great believer in Trustpilot so I initially left a damning review on here.Within a day I was contacted by them and through social media messaging and a few phone calls, a refund was agreed and made.I'm a fair man and give both credit and criticism when due.  Vodafone got it wrong in the first place, but through tenacity and determination, common sense prevailed and Vodafone got it right in the end.",1
"One star is too generous.What an absolute shambles of a company.Called up on the 10th Aug to cancel my existing contract.  Member of the cancellations team enquired as to why I was cancelling - explained I wanted the Note 9 - they offere to do a flexi upgrade on my account and for £79 upfront I'd more or less be on the same contract.  A little bit more expensive a month but yes ok fine.  As a pre-oder bonus I would also receive the handset on the 17th Aug, a week ahead of the official release date.  Great.  I get a confirmatory text explaining these details and the specifics on the new contract and date of delivery.No email comes through and during the week I get in touch through vodafone live chat on no less than four occasions to enquire why my order number isnt coming up on their tracking system.I'm told that pre-orders dont work on the tracking system.I'm told that not to worry sir we can assure you the phone will be delivered on the 17th.  You will get  DPD tracking number. Some examples below:You : ok no problems - just to confirm the delivery date?Sunil : The deliver date 17/Aug/2018Radhika : Thanks a lot for waiting.I have checked the details for you and i can see that you have upgraded your order with the SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9 - 128GB - OCEAN BLUEHowever, as this is pre-ordering will get the handset 1 week before release date which is 24th August 2018, Delivery will be made to your home address on the 17th August 2018Radhika : DPD will message you beforehand with a time slot and will be delivered in the times of 8AM - 6PM.No phone came, better yet - after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes I'm told that no-one knows anything about this pre-order bonus.The vodafone representative acknowledges this and refers me to Complaints.  I call the complaints number and I just dont understand what the functionality of that department is.  They offered no explantion, reason or any kind of remuneration for the mis-selling of this 'offer'.I then called 191 about cancelling my order.  I'm told that I cannot cancel the order as its still 'open'.  I now need to wait until next week to receive the phone (despite it not being dispatched yet) before I can cancel.I am lost for words.An absolute shambles.Update - after contacting the social media team I called 191 to ensure my preorder was in fact cancelled. I spoke with a very helpful chap called Colin who was sympathetic with the situation. He was able to get me a great deal on the phone.  I have updated the rating to 3 stars as at the end of the day I was mis sold, but looking at the average rating I'm clearly not alone with my experience.",1
"We've had mixed experiences with Vodafone. We had a £200 bill rack up on a completed contract and the first time we heard of it was when a debt collector contacted us. Eventually, with alot of investigation Vodafone end they put it down to an Admin error. That aside, when we have had the need to contact them we have had quick service.My advice is use them wisely, if there's a good deal going then snap it up, just make sure your contracts are ""CLOSED"" at the Vodafone end.",1
"Vodafone are great when you are paying them for a contract, but as soon as you ask for something in return, it's no.  I am going away for a year working where I cannot use my contract, so will be paying for it at £24 a month but not using any of the features.Basically vodafone will be getting this money and I won't be using anything in return.  I understand that I have to pay for the phone, and accept this, but I thought they might give me a reduction on my monthly payment as I won't be using any data, minutes or texts.  I need to take my phone to use with a tourist SIM card.",1
"I signed up to a Vodafone plan through mobiles.co.uk because of a cashback offer on a high data allowance. My company also offers an employee discount on 12-mo Vodafone contracts. So I decided to give it a go.Vodafone have the best network in the UK. The Ofcom network coverage maps demonstrate it pretty well, and I did my own independent testing, and Vodafone came out on top in every place I've visited - 79% any coverage during my regular commute. I get fast speeds and general reliability is more stable than O2 and far superior to 3.There are many issues with Vodafone though:1. Some settings simply cannot be changed without getting in touch with customer service. For example, voicemail was completely inaccessible for months and only by ""resetting"" the voicemail was it resolved (not sure why it was not setup correctly in the first place, perhaps as I transferred numbers). Other settings also just show errors when trying to change them such as the age restriction bar.2. When changing limits and settings on the website or app, sometimes it ends up changing other settings unintentionally back to their defaults, or, the setting you actually changed reverts back (as if it never applied in the first place).3. Sometimes when trying to access the website just to get my bills, I'd just get an error saying come back later, which happened for a month - whereas the app was able to make changes without issue.4. If you sign up for a new contract with Vodafone with a new SIM card, even if your old contract has already ended, it takes 30 days to transfer your phone number to the new contract. Whereas moving the number to another provider would have taken at most a couple of days. I've managed to get it down to 7 days through threatening to leave, but this is still unacceptable.5. I previously wanted to leave shortly after my first contract ended, and I asked for my PAC code, and received comms about it many times, but never actually received the code. My online account was also unintentionally deleted so could no longer get to my bills or see my plan.6. When I cancelled a retention plan, the comms said I had to return my phone. The phone that I had actually bought myself and was not part of the contract. This is very misleading and other users could end up believing this.7. My experience of in-store staff is mixed - sometimes they were attentive and sometimes not. Though I don't blame this on the company per se.Overall, I'm very pleased with the coverage and data speed, on the fence about price changes, and not happy about customer service. I would be hesitant to recommend.",1
Customer service is good but u will never get promised broadband speed.,1
"Love the chat feature much easier than calling and listening to hold music constantly.Been with Vodafone for 20 + years and there ""deals"" are no where near as competitive as the new providers.  All they want to do is SELL you more- more date more talk time and every year I call about my contract I ask the same question - what is my ACTUAL usage. I don't want to pay OVER my requirements and with most places with free WIFI and whatsapp who needs huge data packages unless it's for businesses?  My contract gets agreed with a price and no sooner this happens and ""additional % cost"" gets added a few months later - do they think we won't notice.Just wish they'd stop selling my details onto 3rd parties.",1
Customer service not bad... but not great either,1
"I have had a few problems with Vodafone from delivery problems and connection which was frustrating but i have to say how ever annoyed or anary i was going onto a phone call to customer service I found it very hard to remain angry as the level of help and professionalism from the sales, retentions and complaints team was extraordinary they are a credit to the company and I don't think vodafone would be operatingreat without them",1
"it is not even the speed of 2g, the price is good compared to other profile companies",1
"Be careful with the Europe global roaming. This allows you to use your bundle minutes and texts while in Europe, so you could call the UK from France or send texts to the UK from France. However, if you send a text to France from the UK, you will be charged international rate! Even if you take on the option of international saver for an extra £3 or £5 a month, you can then call from the UK to Europe but you will still be charged international rate for sending a text to Europe.... Pretty unfair considering that texts are a lot cheaper to handle than call for the mobile operator.",1
"I have broadband - they're too expensive for mobile plans and would never use a landline. The broadband is good enough for the £21 that I'm paying. I am not sure of its reach, as, in a two bedroom flat, it loses connection in one of the bedrooms - only two walls between the router and room. Very weird. But through only one wall (to the other bedroom), my laptop is well-connected to the WiFi. My phone loses connection sometimes. It's a weird signal, I guess. Their customer service was fine with me, had to talk to them quite a bit to ensure that everything runs smoothly before deciding to take the package. Then when it should've gone live - it didn't, so I phoned them. A fine solution, it was because of my plug in the wall - oh well. But they're good for broadband. Good enough. I've never actually had fast and well-working WiFi, not with Sky (and they have terrible customer service), not with EE, nor with TalkTalk. So I guess Vodafone is good enough.",1
"Could be better. Can't fault the signal and strength of the network. Never had any problems. Been with them for at least 10 years now and trying to get a better deal out of them come upgrade time is like trying to squeeze blood out of a stone. Very reluctant. Unless you tell them you're going to leave instead. Then you might get a slightly better deal. And the range of handsets on offer is very very poor. If you want something other than a Samsung or an Apple, no chance.I went to Carphone Warehouse as I wanted the Google Pixel 2 but had nothing but problems with them. Fair play to Vodafone who have advised me and helped me deal with CW's mess up.",1
Extremely long waits for customer service 40 minutes +0.3 Mbps speed on my Superfast 2 broadband which was guaranteed to be 55MbpsConnected directly to master socket with LAN connection to router.My internet was faster than this 15 years ago!Edit March 2021: Increased star rating as internet speeds have been reliably fast (50Mbps) for well over a year.,1
"This is one of worst singnal in my location. They give 1.4GB per day but we can't use it full. They are smartly remove our signal and save their money. If we was call cus.care they said your connection is good then clear your searched files from your website. This is too waste. I got more angry but what will I do against them, they consider me as a 10 to 11 people only.....",1
"When the 4g wi-fi network is good it's really good however when it's bad and you can't  get online, complaining to vodafone gets you an extra 250mg of data allowance to use in seven days BUT you can't use it because you have no network connection - thanks for nothing vodafone",1
"Very quick to say you haven't paid, even when you have and can prove it. Disappointing response to chat.",1
"Leaving after 3 years - all down to lack of communication. I have a sim only contract which is due to expire next month. I called up this week to renew it for another 12 months and was told I’d be on the exact same contract. Happy enough, I went online straight away to apply my EA discount (30%) only to find it was showing as 15%. Called them back to query this and was told that recent changes have seen the discount cut in half. Why wasn’t I told this to begin with? Tried to haggle with them however they point blank refused to budge on a £17 a month deal (for which I’m currently paying £14). Only a couple of quid a month I know, but why would I want to pay more than what I currently am, especially when I only use about half of my monthly data allowance?!Anyway I asked for my current tariff to be reinstated and gave 30 days notice of leaving them. Got on the blower to EE who offered me the EXACT same deal for £13 a month. No brainier...Vodafone called me back a few days later asking why I was leaving. They then offered me the same deal I’d declined just a few days prior, despite me telling them about EE’s superior offer. No thanks!As if that wasn’t enough, they text me this morning telling me about changes to the EA discount applicable from 4th February... erm hello it’s now 18th February! Perhaps if they’d sent this out earlier then we would’ve avoided this debacle and I may have considered paying the extra.This isn’t the first time Voda have messed me about. I took out broadband and home phone with them 2 years ago, only to be fobbed off and charged more than they promised! Promptly cancelled and took my business elsewhere... EE to the rescue again!",1
"vodafones service on the tube is not v good, unlike ee you cannot connect to the internet, is it just me?",1
"As a mobile phone company they are about as good as it gets (which isn't too marvelous anyway) and their broadband works where Talktalk failed miserably. However... when renewing my contract I was offered free NowTv. It seems though that to use this I need to enter my payment details and then remember to cancel my 'subscription' in 12 months. This is an old technique used to rip people off (Brittania music anyone?). Not impressed at all. Shape up Vodafone! This is sneaky, underhand and not how I expect to be treated as a customer.",1
I've given up trying to solve my problem. They owe me just over £20 due to billing issues and after ringing up several times over the last two months I've lost the will and not going to bother.The call centre staff are friendly but have no knowledge or power to solve anything.EDIT: After seeing this post I was contacted by a UK customer support office who had a lot more technical knowledge than the usual call centre staff and solved the refund instantly.,1
Average customer service. Best network though.,1
Trying to end my contact by phone. Always busy. At lest 40 minute wait. Still unable to get through. Will have to spend an afternoon waiting in the shop at this rate. Poor customer service. Extortionate contracts that never remain the same.,1
I have had many issues with Vodafone over the past year. However my credit check passed successfully with them and not with other providers so I thought I'd go ahead as at least I have a new phone! With this contract I won't be paying by Direct Debit. Instead I will do it manually to ensure that the bills are correct and to ensure that no overcharged amounts are taken from my bank. I agree with the reviews here on Trustpilot and personally I wouldn't have chosen Vodafone a second time. However at least I have a new phone out of it! So I can't really grumble...,1
"It took time to sort out the broadband before it actially worked (days). Part of the problem was the lack of technical knowledge at the call centre and an inability to do anything but follow the computer screen prompts at their end. The gentleman that solved the problem was great but even he was annoyed with the mess.Re the free gift.... the marketing company should be sacked and never used again. There are problems in getting in contact with them as there are a lot of unhappy customers without gifts, in particular a speaker that has now lost a quarter of its value before I've got it. Added to that an inability to communicate the correct information to me I now feel the whole gift thing was a big con.If Vodafone is offering the best deal for you then great. Any gift offered is a bonus if it arrives.",1
Very good signal most of the time but they are more expensive than other networks. I was with them for a while but I then had to change,1
"Average service, slow",1
Vodafone's Internet broadband is a bad choise.Continues failures and lower speed than i had with BT.,1
"Reception ok, but dubious charges on the bill when I went abroad to Spain. Have complained and waiting to hear.",1
"Spoke to agent on live chat reference upgrading my phone, I asked for a good deal as I have been a customer for shy of 10 years.  After minutes of hagling with the agent, a deal was struck, was I happy with it... sure.Order was put through and chat ended.I decided to check Vodafones web page to see how much I'd saved......LOL the same special offer given to me was staring me in the face, apart from the upfront cost of £30. So no special offer for a long serving customer,  I guess my loyalty wasn't really of interest to the agent. Thanks a bunch.",1
"After lots of haggling and lots of misinformation from the call centres in Egypt, they did put me through to someone in the UK and they have given me the best deal I could find, so in that respect i'm very happy. £22 for 40Gb data unlimited txts and mins as well as spotify premium is very reasonable. However getting anything else sorted is an absolute nightmare. My mother switched the account into my name when I was 18, that was 6 years ago now and they are still billing her £4.17 every month for 6 years, on her credit file. But when they search her on the system there is no account in existence with her name to it. it's an absolute joke. So she can't even pay this supposed fee. There call centre staff just have no idea. Therefore I would suggest avoiding vodafone their billing system is an absolute mess.",1
"I have been with Vodafone since 2015, all was well until 2 months ago when they started changing me for using my free data, after wasting hours chatting with them they sorted it out. And all was good, until now, for some reason they charged me double for this and next month. I spoke with them again, even went to a store, in the end thay said it was a glitch in the system and that they have fixed it. I am still waiting for my bill to find out. After my contract ends I don't know what I will do, I am disappointed with all the Asian and Indian people I have to talk with who don't even live in England... 3 stars go for the 1 and a half year of no problems",1
been with them for 11 months now and been good but didn't like how they charge to use phone in europe but three dosnt charge at all which i find really good,1
My husband rang  to upgrade my mobile phone contract as  the account is in his name. The first person he spoke made no effort to make a good deal. So my husband ended the call.He rang back 30 minutes later and got a more interested person who managed to find a deal for no upfront charge and over £8 per month cheap.Ring back if you don't get the deal you like is my advice,1
Been a loyal customer for many years - had many bad experiences but today was good. I felt the gentleman I spoke to was very understanding. Guess it's a little bit of luck who picks up the phone!,1
I have been with Vodafone for years. The network coverage is very good but they are quite expensive and when ever I try to call them the service is not that great,1
"I had to go into my local shop in Basingstoke recently. I was met by someone who turned out to be the manager. His attitude stunk. I would have cancelled my contract and gone elsewhere, it was that bad.In the end i spoke to a young man, (think his name was Jo and he was quite new), who took time to listen to me, helped with the problems I was having and restored my faith in the store. He was fantastic.Because of Jo you've retained a customer. If it had been left to the manager, your have lost me and I'd have made sure I spread the word about appalling attitude.",1
"I have used Vodafone for years, always finding their staff helpful.  However, since moving to a new area the reception on my phone has been poor.  It seems more and more these days other networks give better reception.",1
"Been with Vodafone for over 20 years now , had 5 lines with them and although I have had issues ( some pretty ridiculous to be honest ) they have usually managed to sort me out in the end . Recently had problems ending an iPad contract . They disconnected the wrong line despite several contacts webchat and calls to make sure the error was corrected . They then didn't carry out the reconnection process and it took a call to the uk complaint line to get some decent action the operator was very helpful competent and efficient .the line was reconnected in 30 mins with. Thank you for that Vodafone ,please why can't you provide that service all the time .",1
"Tricked into signing up as the salesperson promised me a discount that didn't materialise.Despite providing a transcript of our conversation I still had to jump through a 100 hoops to get the discount, which I now have.I do have an excellent deal and good coverage so I'm happy with vodafone itself but the customer service experience was a nightmare until finally resolved.",1
