Scam artists. Called to get Internet. Lady told me they cover my area. Find out they don't. Customer service representative took a 100 bucks knowing at&t had no coverage in my area! I'm filing fraud charges with mank! YOUR NOT GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!,0
"Be aware of their AT&T promotion. I have been  customer individually for almost 4 years and business customer for way longer. I decided to use their promotion $1000 for trade in. They offered me $1,000 promo trade in for my 13 Pro Max 512 GB for 3 year contract. Today I got message they give me only $350 for the phone in a perfect condition without any scratch (always had screen protector and case on) that I could trade in to Apple Store for $350 without any contract or sell privately for about $650. I consider that to be a real scam and I do not want to be customer any more and want my old phone back. Customer support is useless and they even don’t see yet  that my next bill would be adjusted and I would be paying way more.",0
"My daughter got a phone on payments plus unlimited phone service, 1st month phone bill was $211, 2nd month $86, now in her 3rd month it’s $113, why is this not consistent pricing? They told her the first month would be a little over a $100 well it was 211, her phone bill plus phone payment is supposed to run $86 a month total, not $113 like this month.. Very inconsistent and I would definitely not recommend.. I’m not sure if it’s a problem with all att stores or just the one in Berea Kentucky.. Not pleased, fixing to return phone and go with different carrier",0

"worst service ever !! Im in Thailand all my friends either had a ESIM card or their Carrier  gave them either free days or signed them up for a one month international plan at a very good price .AT&T Does neither ! You can NOT get a intl plan you have to pay 12.99 a Day! You can NOT use a SIM card, AT&T  Carrier will not allow it unless your phone is paid off and even then only certain ones .. so I have to pay 190.00 for 2 week vacation. And they said today counted because I called THEM!! would not even credit me for calling them .. They just want you to give more money to them!!I’m a Realtor in Washington and since I switched , I can’t tell you how bad the service is , literally showing a house in the city and No service !! embarrassing to clients  !! switching carriers as soon as I get Back !! Horrible Company!",0

They are doing everything illegally. I cannot even move to other service as they made me to stay with them for 3 years. Made a very big mistake moving from Verizon to AT&T. I wish AT&T go bankrupt soon. They are losing customer confidence. Their billing is most corrupt in the nation. Please don't believe Costco AT&T sales people are any sales and move blindly to AT&T. Tmobile has a better service than AT&T in NJ. Lets all sue AT&T for the illegal business practice they are doing.,0

The store that I purchased this at was very accommodating and tried to help in every way they could put their hands are tied too ultimately I returned the iPhone 16 and of course, lost my iPhone 12 and feel like I was taken, I’m going to discuss this situation fully with the rest of my family that has my other three lines besides mine and we are going to go a different direction.

AT&T fees are excessive $45 plus $10 they offer you discounts and they never give them. Look for other options that offer better service. I would never recommend to AT&T,0
Bought a new phone as trade in 17 months ago and discovered that at&t auto pay and the line from old phone was still continuing so was charged since then. They never bothered to discontinue the line when switched to new phone and just let it happen. Place is deceitful and wouldn't even bother to refund hundreds of dollars lost from this and will never use At&t ever again. Would recommend same to not use for others who use them.,0
"unacceptable in everyway $70 a month for complete trash that doesn't work.

"We were quoted $30 a line. The first bill was over $1,000! We were on the phone for 6 hours trying to correct it. Finally it was corrected and we were sent an email, because we had to request it, of what our monthly bill should be. Seven months later we still are not billed correctly. It constantly shift from $500-$800. We then call and spend hours on the phone to get it to $450.00 were it belongs. This company should be out of business.",0
This people are real thief’s  !  They sent me an email with an offer and their representative told me to wait a few days to take up on the offer ( maybe he didn’t want to do it at that moment) and to call back on Monday to get that taken care of. I spend all day Monday calling ATT and just kept getting transfer from place to place to than be told that the offer had expired  and there was nothing they could do about it. Even tho I missed the offer because their own employee provided me with the wrong information. This company does not look out for the long time costumer all they care about is the money. This will be the last month I spend with them.,0
"AT&T's service has been disappointing for me. I've experienced frequent outages and slow internet speeds that have made it difficult to work from home. Customer support has been challenging to reach, and when I do get through, the solutions offered don't seem to resolve my issues. Overall, I expected better reliability and responsiveness based on their reputation, but my experience has not met those expectations.",0
I started using AT&T prepaid a few months ago and it is the worst service I have ever used. I have to change. Logging in to pay is so ridiculous due to the switching between code and password and due to pw requirements. They try to force you to pay without signing in. There is no way to see payment history. My own mother can't even call. Customer service is terrible. Now i have to change providers AGAIN because of the issues.,0

NO LegsNO CarNO FamilyATT used to be a good place to do business.  I guess it's a direct reflection of this country.  For 6 weeks been begging for a way to return my old internet hardware only to be mistreated again and again.  Only trying to upsell me more service or lies.  Yet it sits with a threat of a $150 fee and sitting on my $35 credit.  On disability $35 is a weeks worth of groceries.  Nobody cares they think it's a joke to be disabled.,0
Spent an hour on the phone with a technical support rep Jospeh trying to troubleshoot my apple watch cellular plan. After not being able to resolve my issue he gave me the wrong phone number for advanced technical support. Spent a total of 4 hours on the phone with multiple different reps in an attempt to do a simple activation of an apple watch. Most masochistic experience of my life. I was respectful and patient the whole time and had a rep put me in hold purgatory.,0
"I have a landline, high speed internet and Directv. I can't do anything on att.com because no matter what I select, I am immediately redirected to directv. So if I wanted to pay the landline or internet, I can't. I've told them a hundred times for several years, they acknowledge it, but never do anything about it. This company must have the worst web designers and IT people on the planet. I pray that the cost of removing the underground lead cable and pension obligations puts them out of business. They do nothing to maintain infrastructure and their fancy fiber cable is coated in a peanut based material the squirrels just love to chew on. This is hands down the absolute worst American Company. Shameful and overpriced to the extreme for terrible customer service.",0
"My experience with AT&T has been nothing short of a nightmare. It began when they accessed my backyard without permission while I wasn’t home, and during this time, a laptop was stolen. Despite raising concerns, nothing was done about the theft—no compensation, no accountability.Fast forward about a year later, when I attempted to deny AT&T technicians access to the utility pole on my property due to a lack of easement. Instead of handling the matter professionally, the technician refused to leave when asked, and the situation escalated alarmingly: I was threatened with a gun and bullied on my own property.The police were contacted, and a report was filed. However, even after AT&T conducted an ""investigation,"" no meaningful action was taken. Their resolution? Terminating my service. This response felt more like retaliation than a solution.AT&T's handling of these incidents demonstrated an utter lack of accountability, professionalism, and respect for customer safety and property rights. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this company to anyone.",0
"rude employees who are not helpful in any way, shape, or form. i always make it a mission to be kind to any service employees but the associate in their mount pocono location might be the rudest woman i have ever encountered. i gave her no reason to speak to me in such a condescending tone.",0
Canceled the cell phone within the 30 day Costco period and is in collections for a 2 month service period. AT@T does not care and it shows,0
"With what was a good company has turned into a horrible one.  Five agents and five issues later, nothing has been resolved.  Having one agent ignore this customers plight and decide to place him back in line, really says it all.  No thank you, onto their competitor.",0
AT&T/Direct TV- Tried to cancel after my husband passed away and I could not afford it. They continued to charge me and added a third more on my next bill.  Many phone calls to try and correct it.  Then they called me offering me more deals.  Not listening to me and up charging me when I am already struggling.,0
1 star is too high. when you have a problem with A T and T's service and it is clearly their fault the solution is to say they are correcting the issue but it will result in you getting a higher bill. I thought Verizon was bad but this has gone to a new low. I have NEVER regretted using a service in my life as much as signing up this total rip off of a company.I would rather use smoke signals to communicate than pay them one more dime to get less than what I have paid for. I'm guessing data breaches and over charged accounts for services not rendered is their new norm.I Hope They Go Out Of Business,0
"5G is a SCAM. You’ll be lucky if you even get 3. I’m in the middle of the city and it RARELY loads anything. If you are deciding which service. DO NOT GO WITH AT&T!! They have spent more $ on marketing then actually improving their services. STOP PROMOTING 5G if we don’t get 5G. I have $ to spend so I tried each different plan. The only difference is hotspot/unlimited data into the bundle, but the speeds are STILL THE SAME. They lie and say they’re able to support 5G.",0
"I don't know how they still have customers. AT&T allows their reps to lie to customers. Our bill was astronomically higher than what was promised. We were charged for a phone that was supposed to be free with trade ins. Even with proof of all of this, customer service did nothing.They are perfectly fine with lying, scamming and stealing to get that contract. On top of all of that, the service is a joke. All that money and the phone barely works.I wish I would have read the reviews before taking that leap. Don't make the same mistake. Stay far away.",0
"AT&T has locked my cell phone and refuses to unlock it. Salesmen in-store and customer service failed to disclose to me their policy of requiring service for 6 months until after I purchased service with another carrier but couldn't use it because my phone was locked. This lack of disclosure about the 6-month service requirement has caused me significant distress and financial inconvenience. I meet the requirements listed on their website to unlock it. I requested an unlock but the male tech support refuses, was rude and he yelled at me. The store employees said I will have to purchase another wireless phone. I have a family and have been without cellular service for a week and customer service knew my intention to end prepaid service with AT&T and I've paid for service with another carrier but can't use it. It took hours to reach anyone and I had big problems initially starting service which should have been a red flag.",0
The promotion I used was to trade in your old phone from another carrier and get the new phones with At&t for free.  I did just that I even had to jump through hoops to send in my old phones.  I am on my 6th bill and still paying for the new phones.  The excuse is they are still processing my return.  I wish I never switched over.  I am now paying  $350 a month for 3 phones and the service sucks as well.,0
"The worst customer service from store managers to call center.  I have been attempting for months to get a billing issue resolved and they will not even allow you to speak with anyone that can help.  They claim that a case is created for a manager to review, however no one ever follows up.  Very disappointing service.",0
"I have been trying to unlock one of my cell phones that I purchased at AT&T. The unlock was entered incorrectly and there is a network lock. I have been waiting over 5 days for this to get fixed only to find out today I will need to get to an at&t store to get a sims card to enter the unlock code. they could have told me that on Monday but waited until now. I have canceled my account with them. And I will be billed a full months service + a cancellation fee. This is a very bad company to do any business with. They are ruthless, unelthical, immoral and shameless. Once they are in your pockets ... it takes a lot of patience to remove their hands! One important piece of advise: never ever take a sales persons information as having any credibilty from at&t or any other provider. They will lie to you and find excuses - I think they provide the staff with a list to use.",0
"I submitted a warranty claim on 11/21/24 for a replacement phone. The phone was shipped and lost during shipping.  I called Asurion again on 11/26/24 to check on the status of the shipment. They told me it was lost and shipped a replacement.  I called back again on 12/3/24 to check on the status of my replacement.  Asurion told me once again that the shipment was lost during shipping.  I finally spoke with a Supervisor who finally got me my replacement device.  However, I learned that I had been charged a $250 deductible on each of the previous replacement shipments.  The Supervisor advised me that I would only be charged the one original deductible and the other two deductibles would be credited to my account.  I get my Nov-Dec bill and it turns out I was still charged the other deductibles.  I call Asurion and they say I have to call AT&T for the refund on the refunds.  I call AT&T and they say I have to call Asurion.  This back-and-forth has been going on since 12/3/24.  I called Asurion and AT&T on 1/8/25 and they said they would issue a refund. It should only take 7 to 10 business days.  I call Asurion on 1/19/25 to check on the status of my refund and they state that AT&T can only issue the refund.  I call AT&T on 1/19//25 and they state I can only get my refund from Asurion.  I tried to speak with a Supervisor for both companies and each one disconnected the calls.  I was billed over $700 on my bill.  AT&T refused to transfer my call to a Supervisor on multiple attempts on 1/19/25.  First attempt I held for 20 minutes and was disconnected.  Second attempt, I was holding for 40 minutes before being disconnected.  On the third attempt, the agent refused to transfer the call to a Supervisor and hung up on me!  Do NOT get a warranty from Asurion and /AT&T.",0
"I cancelled the company's business phone service with ATT April 2024, then saw a bill for a credit of $6k. Instead of receiving a check, I later received another bill for $2k. Turns out, they switched the account number from my old one to a new one, and were paying the bills with the credit that was left over. Now, not only do they not want to refund the credit but they want me to pay $3k. They are claiming that number was tied to our account, but if it was, when I cancelled, why didn't they cancel it as well? Why did they switch the account number from the old phone number to this new phone number. I was speaking to customer service, and when I made that statement, the lady hung up on me or something because she was no longer on the line.",0
"I was lied to be a ATT&T employee at a store when told about a promotion. He said we would not have any additional lines added to the bill, and it would only be a few dollars more a month for new devices (apple watch/ipad that I didn't even want, I went in to upgrade my phones). When I saw my bill and called the store even confirmed he no longer worked there because he did this to other people. Anyway, they debited $500 from my account in additional fees, and my plan went up over $100 a month for lines I don't use. Now I've spent hours on the phone trying to get a refund and cancel the phone lines and they are sending me in circles without correcting anything. I filed a fraud complaint that was denied because the representative helping didn't understand the situation either. Huge waste of money and time. Not mentioning details is one thing, but to lie to my face with no accountability is insane. Very bad business & customer service.",0
"Setting up as a new customer and transferring from another carrier, I selected a plan and ordered a phone. Order was confirmed, $$$ deducted from my bank account (set up auto-pay for additional discount), yet no correspondence received had any information on how to set up a way to access my AT&T account, therefore no way to log in, etc. Numerous emails and jumping through hoops attempting to initiate the Signature Program through my employer, a major university where I’ve worked over 15 years, which discount was denied, I called AT&T customer service and was transferred numerous times, finally landing with the rudest rep I have ever encountered. They insisted I must have set up an account with a passcode  for the order to go through, despite my insistence I did not do so - I only provided my email, phone number, SS#, address, etc., online on their website. I have a MacBook which saves every account and password created and have nothing stored. They continued to berate me when I requested the order be cancelled stating they couldn’t since the account wasn’t active. All the red flags are going off and I will not be doing business with this company after this frustrating experience.",0

WRONG. My bill ended up increasing by over $50. Representative straight up lied to me about the plan and bill charges…I guess to just get the sales. Anyhow, I have since cancelled my ATT internet and now have ported my number over to a new company. Paid off my $1500 iPad so I could move that service as well to the new company. Money is not the object, it is the principle of what happened and how it was done.

Very poor company standards.",0

AT&T’s Internet and service is horrible.  We have had off and on service since before Christmas and today it’s off again.  According to them it’s a fiber issue and they’ve be working it since December 23.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable AND they decided to give us a $5 credit.  We work from home and this inconvenience is far more than $5 and over multiple days.  I’ve been with AT&T well over 30 years and it has significantly declined over the years.  Their service is horrible and unreliable.  I’ll be looking into another service today.,0

"BEWARE of AT&T bait and switch tactics are becoming infamous for if you read on Google. I have twice now been bait and switched on two different promos. I’m a long-term 15 year customer with multiple lines. i’ve noticed there’s recent lawsuits on this bait and switch tactic also recently so I guess I’m not the only one who’s experiencing this. One was an advertise special in an AT&T store for $20 for an additional line which they didn’t honor and ended up after I went to the BBB speaking with their so-called office of the president. What a joke to resolve their reason for not honoring it the store shouldn’t have been advertising the promo. It was not going on, but yet they take no accountability. Number two promo was upgrade your iPhone with trade-in, my spouse and I did this. They honored mine and not my spouses continuing to charge him full price every month, not giving him the credit that he was supposed to get for his turned in device. I have fought with them over this for over a year through the BBB and the so-called office of the president again it’s a joke this office of the president reps have lied to me each time I talk to them about the resolution there never was a resolution, and they lie in states there were. any problems with your AT&T bill can never be handled with customer service at AT&T because every employee is not educated and tells you a different story and tells you they can’t handle it. You then have to go to the BBB who is very good about submitting the complaint with them and AT&T contact you back right away through the so-called office of the president which totally lies to you and tells you they’ll resolve it. It has been a nightmare for over a year and a half and they have cost me thousands of dollars taking advantage of hard-working people who only take advantage of the promo. and then our bait and switched this should be illegal and they have no accountability. I’m now being forced to take them to court. i would suggest steer clear of AT&T as they literally lie to make money off you.",0
The absolute worst. Inexplicable charges and fees constantly. I am so glad to be done with this horrible company.,0
"Att store at costa mesa3711 S Bristol, Ste 104, Santa Ana, CA 92704We recently opened a new line and specifically requested that AT&T Next be added to the account. Unfortunately, it wasn’t added as requested. I called the store spoke to Ana who initially helped us and assured us to that if we came back to the store, look for the store manager Edgar, they would take care of it.On New Year’s Day, we made the hour-long drive, only to be told by Edgar that it was now past the 14-day window and they could no longer add it. If he had properly addressed the issue in the first place, we wouldn’t have wasted our time and effort.This manager displayed poor customer service, refused to take accountability for the mistake, and left us deeply frustrated by the lack of resolution. We switched to at&t for this poor service. It’s so sad!",0
They don't look out for there costumes it's all about the money be paying for 2 years on time lost my job out of work for 3 months they don't care please don't go to them they boss don't care either been on the phone with them all day,0
"If I could pick 0 stars I would,  but it isnt available.  Their customer service is terrible.  They dont listen when you tell them you have issues.  I plan to run,  not walk away from AT&T for good.  All they care about is the almightly dollar.  BUYER BEWARE.  Their current rating doesnt surprise me.",0
I have been going through this with AT&t home service and my phone service at my home -NO SERVICE!  my landline it has been out since August of 2024 and today is January 19th 2025. When you call at & t keeps coming up with different excuses stating that it was restored but some customers are still not restored they refuse to send anyone out to your home to investigate. And on top of that they have the nerve to send you bills as if your service is still remaining I have no wireless service I have to spend more money to go do my job elsewhere I'm not being compensated about this I've contacted corporate who does not care this is a billion dollar company and if people are still in copper are you really trying to tell us in Los Angeles that you don't have the money to prevent this this is absurd I'm very disappointed and would like everyone to know do not become a new customer of AT&t because they don't care about their customers they'll give you a date and then they'll call you back if they call you back and push the date back and back and back and back and then you have to call to be recompensated for the money that you have on your books as a credit already because they're taking it as if I'm getting service do not use AT&t they're disgusting despicable in the world needs to know this. I still do not have service and this is 2025. No internet no wireless no home landline service AT&t you are a disaster! Living in the urban community perhaps that's the reason is it racism is it that they don't give a dang what is it are they trying to get us to buy a different brand to manipulate us with no service there's many questions but no answers all the copper has been stolen that's you know it's it's too many excuses we don't care about that at this point we want it restored or there should be a lawsuit in the near future!,0
"AT&T has been installing fiber in our neighborhood for the past few months. They were at our neighbors and installing service for them. THEY TRENCHED IN OUR YARD AND CUT OUR INTERNET CABLE!! We have Xfinity. I called AT&T and was told they can not come out and fix since it is not their equipment!! WTH!! So now we have no services! NO INTERNET, WI FI, TV, SECURITY CAMERAS!!! I had to take action MYSELF and call Xfinity to set up a tech appointment so they can come out and fix. What type of INCOMPETENT AND CARELESS techs does AT&T have working for them!!!!! And to think, we were considering switching services from Xfinity to AT&T fiber. Hahaha!!",0
Constantly telling me I’m grandfathered into a plan but that while it is still the same I pay significantly more than I originally agreed to with no actual benefits.  Service is getting progressively worse with dead spots all over the city and support can’t even answer basic questions.  After over a decade of decline it has finally reached a point where I’m actually looking into the very few other options seriously even though moving carriers is a hassle.,0
"For the love of humanity and god, Do not ever choose ATT. They are open criminals and will do anything to siphon money from you. I thought ATT was a big company and they had millions of cell towers so they must be good. But I made the mistake of not checking trustpilot.. They have 1 star overall review which is INSANE. Do yourself a favor and go with Usmobile, mint mobile,redpocket, or Tmobile. They would not let me cancel my port request, wouldn't let me cancel my service, and they ship you out a ESIM instead of emailing you it.",0
They will rip you off stating they never received payment then you show proof and they still want to hit you with a late fee. You ask to speak to a manager because the first agent is being rude then the manager Julia is also rude and smartallic. Do not go with this service. Metro has a better plan.,0
"Absolutely garbage phone service and the customer service is way worse than anyone could imagine. Have insurance on our phones and were told we still have to pay $200 to have the glass fixed.No point in doing business with this company based on what I've mentioned and when you add in how many data leaks they've had, it's beyond comprehension how they are still in business.",0
Beware of this company. They are not secure in anyway on their MyATT app. Mine got hacked and a double payment was made. One being authorized and another not. They will make you pay for their mistake. They will not correct it either. Their customer service is pathetic. They don’t care about their customers they didn’t through Covid either. I received a letter in the mail about my information being compromised and that they believed no personal information was stolen but explain to me how an unauthorized payment was made. Done go to T-Mobile for service they are by far AMAZING,0
AT&T has horrible customer service-wait times 1-1/2 hours. Can u believe an agent referred me to their Spectrum competitor? Have chronic problem w 3-4 technicians out and STILL not fixed. After being a 25 year client we r thinking of switching. What a bloody and stressful mess. Horrible!,0
Att waited till brother passed away and sent a bogus bill to collections. He cancelled his service after paying his bill went to TMobile to get better charges and after a month he passed away. Att never sent a bill or nothing. Then sent a bogus bill to collections and then sent a letter to lawyer to delay probate. This service is not professional or caring. Would not recommend Att to anyone!,0
I have to gave att one star or less. Don’t trust any of them from sales representative when they ask you for promotion from att to get discount from current bill. The sales representative was cheating me. I did call att to ask them why my bill higher last couple month bill after sale representative told me att had promotions discount to customer if add one more phone line from my account.I spoke with representative customer service your guys were cheating with customer today.Don’t trust them and I am going change another provider.,0
Phone support is available after an hour wait at which time the untrained agent will need to transfer you (another 45 minutes) to the next bozo who will waste another 40 minutes of your time before finally telling you to call again tomorrow. The att goal is to tire you out until you quit trying to get the problem resolved. The worst support in the industry. Every other carrier is better than att.,0
"Do I have to give a star.The worst service ever, Sales person after agreement wouldn’t return a single call, Calling support, bounced from one department to another, go over the whole issue time and time again, sorry you need to call this department, nope I can’t resolve let me give you the right department, sorry you need to contact this department…... After 2 months of countless calls and countless hours on the phone with them, the internet has never worked. We had to switch back to our old provider which went seamlessly to get by, resulting in us doubling our costs thinking we might get this resolved. . Apparently they have no technicians to visit and resolve issues they can’t resolve over the phone. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",0
DO NOT TRADE-IN YOUR PHONE AT AT&T as i was a 3 years in happy customer i hated it after what happened and i’ll just pay it off and switch to some other company.what happens is recently i traded in my 14 Pro max 512 GB for a 16 Pro max 256 Gb and to be honest with you i had some cracks at the back of the phone but they gave me $830 estimated price for rhe phone at the store and they said my charges would be $11 for the new phone and i took the deal.After i traded-in i called them and they told me the screen wasn’t turning on and off so they revalued my old phone and gave me $400 in credits instead of $830 and i can truly say even if i would sell it i would’ve took $800 so they robbed me by $400 and they only paid $400 for my old phone and when i asked my phone back they told me the policy and terms that i signed up won’t allow me to get it back.There was nothing wrong with the screen they made this to make extra bucks on me and they are probably doing it to a lot of people and making extra millions of dollars by this.Just wanted to let everybody know.I would’ve gave 0 stars if there was an option,0
"dog shit of an fiber service and billing department, every month I had to call loyal department for them to manually adjust my billing because the ticket they submitted for me has yet to be resolved.",0
We have been double charged insurance for our phones. We asked for a credit for the thousands we paid over the last few years and they only want to give us $100.I wonder how many customers they are currently taking advantage of. ATT is making millions from fraudulent charges.,0
"DO NOT GET ATT! Their fraud department flagged my account for no reason, then denied me adding a line.  and refused to tell me why. I have my bill on auto pay and have never missed it, I have excellent credit and make great money. There is no reason to treat a 16 year customer this way. I will be seeking other alternatives for cell phone service.",0
"I am On Auto pay and updated my credit card.They continued to charge my expired card ( which I had removed from my acct.) and sent me an email that I owed 306.00 and was going to have my service shut off. Ernesto,the customer service Rep, was rude and unhelpful.",0
"Consistently poor Internet. Drops out frequently, ATTs own speed test shows they are delivering 20% of the promised speed. Spoke with their ""support"" group multiple times and they are rude, refused to escalate and last time put me on hold for 34 minutes and came back to say they'd call back. That was 2 weeks ago and no call. I'd switch to any other provider, but att is the only option on our road. If you have ANY other options use them.",0
Bill had been 55 a month for four years. Randomly increased to 130 and paid that on Nov 20. Suddenly received another bill for 130 stating if I don’t pay before the 9th then they’ll cut service. I scheduled three calls on the 8th with no call backs and they cut my service at midnight despite me checking my billing history and my bill isn’t due until Dec 20. Can’t get a hold of anyone until tomorrow night and it’s finals week and I have no internet. Honestly kind of ridiculous.,0
"Called customer support for an extension on scheduled payment for a week cause my Medicare advantage flex card arrives by Dec 1st & I have no other funds. They said no. So I won’t be able to stay in contact in case of a crisis with my dr, pharmacy, medical transport or dialysis clinic. I will in 2 months be leaving ATT after my iPhone is paid off to bundle services with xfinity. At least they have empathy.",0
"It was impossible to get through to an actual agent.  After being in voicemail hell for what seemed like an hour, I finally got a link to chat.  Finally, I thought - at least I can get a chat discussion.  Just as the agent  restated what I was trying to explain, the chat disappeared.  SO that was another 20 minutes.  I never was able to solve the problem.",0
0 stars.  Salesman  over phone are blatant liars… trying to milk you for every penny. absolutely lied to time and again.Then we get our bill and have  all sorts of new non discussed add on charges. Obvious fraud!Wasted my time over a hour on phone then wait for our phones to be mailed. Now we get to return them and switch carriers to probably another money grubbing company. But I will never use AT&T again.Know the advertised deals going on or the will take advantage of you.If we did this equivalent as consumers we would be jailed. Complete con artist . Reviews do no good. They need a huge law suit for lying to customers. Class action anyone !!,0
When your internet is out all day and your scheduled time in the evening is screwed up by AT &T and then you can’t get it repaired until 2 full days later. What sort of service is that!! Paying $90 ish a month for below average service and average internet with regularly dropped zoom calls. I will be looking at other options,0
"Our area was extremely hard hit by hurricane helene.  My 90 year old mother was without power for 21 days and without a home phone from Sept 27 to Dec 17.  She paid over $90 per month for the landline service.  She's had the same phone number for over 68 years.  AT&T initially announced they would be issuing credits for people in the area because of interruption of service.  In late December I called to check on her credit which should have been a little over $250.   I was offered $130 and then $200 or I could call back with the dates that I reported the service.  They said they had no record of us calling to report the outage.  I repled it was a hurricane, your lines were completely down.  When I called back with the dates I had reported it, I was told there was no record of me calling the first time today.",0
"AT&T is trying to scam people. When you first get an AT&T line, their customer service is friendly, and they offer you a good price. However, once you receive your first bill, you'll be shocked. They charge various taxes that seem unreasonable, such as communication tax, 911 charges, and state tax. It feels like you went to buy a beer, and then they suddenly ask for licensing fees, food and beverage tax, resale certificate fees, and company registration fees, among others. Be careful don't go with them.",0
"If I could give a lower rating I would.  AT&T is the absolute worst mobile carrier.  Service is slow and nonexistent most of the time and way overpriced.  But the customer service,  that is the real downfall.  AT&T customer service has to be the worst.  They refuse management, refuse call backs, hang up on callers and take an excessive amount of time with transfers.  Don't try to get anything resolved ever, that doesn't happen with AT&T.  I spent 6 hours trying to fix an order AT&T screwed up and nothing was fixed.  I was told I have to place and pay for a new order and dispute previous charges for an order AT&T f'd up.  Thanks for the lack of customer service!",0
"I have never in my life had any interaction with ATT wireless until my new company issued me a new Iphone 2 months ago.  The charging slot will not hold a cable.  I wanted to see if the store had the ability to repair the phone, but that was not to be.I tried for 20 minutes to break through their customer firewalls to get a human, but they engineer their firewalls for maximum time wastage and frustration.So F you immensely ATT, and your profoundly shitty service.  I am now obligated to drive to a store to be ignored there.",0
I have been with AT&T for over 12 years.  I recently lost my job due to medical issues and I'm currently going through chemo.  So I have been making payment arrangements so I paid my past due bill of 290.00 and they advise me I had to make another payment of 234.00 by Dec 14 and can't assist me with a extension.  I understand that there running a business but if I'm loyal to you why kick me while I'm down. I have other bills with no income.  I'm so disgusted with this company.,0
"My bill has doubled because of a mistake made by AT&T and they refuse to help in anyway. Customer service, Martin, with AT&T found this mistake and explained to me what happened and how they believe it happened by an employee in the store when we upgraded my daughter’s phone. But instead of correcting the error they tell me to continue paying the huge bill. They refuse to put me back on the plan that I was happy with for 16 years and are forcing me to now pay 433$ a month instead of my previous 200$ monthly bill! I am furious!",0
"ATT/DIRECTVI COULDN'T BE MORE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR SERVICE.  YOU DON'T DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR. AFTER THE NIGHTMARE TO GET INTERNET AND TV SERVICES, I WOULD NEVER RECOMEND YOU TO ANYONE.  FROM YOUR SALES PERSONAL TO YOUR SUPPORT HELP.  YOU ALL DESERVE A ZERO.  ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SINCE THIS NIGHTMARE STARTED DEC. 20TH HAVE GIVEN ME THE PROPER SUPPORT I NEEDED.  I INFORMED THEM I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE I HAD RECEIVED SO FAR.  I NORMALLY DON'T WRITE REVIEWS BUT AFTER THIS EXPERENCE I HAD TO.  AFTER 38 EMAILS AND 7 TEXT MESSAGES, THATS NOT COUNTING THE ONES I DELETED, AND BEING ON HOLD FOR OVER 4 HOURS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, I FINALLY GOT SERVICE WORKING.  I TRIED TO FIND ON YOUR WEBSITE WHERE I CAN WRITE A REVIEW.  I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND IT.  I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AFTER BEING ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES AND REQUESTING A CALL BACK THAT TOOK OVER 30 MINUTES TO RECEIVE I SPOKE TO SOME FOREIGN PERSON WHO I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, I WAS TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER FOREIGN PERSON I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.  I ASKED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO SPOKE PROPER ENGLISH.  I NEVER GOT TO THAT PERSON.  SINCE THEN I HAVE CALLED THE SALES PERSON WHO SOLD ME THE GARBAGE INTERNET/TV SERVICE AND TOLD THEM TO CANCEL MY SERVICE AND TO COME PICK THEIR EQUIPMENT UP.  EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN ALRIGHT ACCEPT FOR YOUR TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  TOM FROM ROCKFORD, ILL. IS THE ONE PERSON WHO REALLY HELP ME THE MOST.  HE DESERVES 5 STARS.  IF ANYONE FROM ATT/DIRECTV WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT ME, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO.",0
"Used to like them until they discontinued my Internet service. I decided to move to another Internet provider April 2023  they continued to bill me for almost a year after I discontinued service. They stole money off my credit card and when I finally cut off my credit card to prevent more fraudulent charges they sent me to collections. The worst customer service, stole  money for service not received..Beware !!!!!",0
"For all first responders; stay away from AT&T and don’t be fooled by their First Net promises. Especially if you live in rural areas. Their coverage is horrible, customer service is nonexistent and cost will continue to climb year after year. My experience with them has been a nightmare and I am switching providers. Never will I return nor recommend them to anyone",0
"WARNING - AT&T offers deplorable customer service, setting up two account, getting itself completely confused. Double billing me, taking multiple payments.What a NIGHTMARE. I suggest you stay away from this utterly incompetent company",0
"This company is the worst  I change from Verizon  5 lines to get better deal and international deal they told me is going to be $15 dallar for extra line what is was good deal no signal en ecuador bad signal and they send me bill for 1 month $10,000.00 dallar is ridiculous  now theySend to credit report",0
"When I had the phone transfered to my name...the rep just did a transfer of financial responsablity. So when I went in 4 days later to get it all moved over as it should have been I told them I wanted to keep my new number. That was fine, but what they did was basically give me 2 acct for 1 phone. So even though I'm paying my bill on time, there was another acct I didn't know about. That acct got shut down for no payment then they hit me with a 1400 dollar bill with my device on it. They basically said sorry there is nothing we can do ...how do you want to pay this....for their screw up",0
"I hate ATT! I left Tmobile because of their terrible customer service. They are stellar compared to ATT. Everyone i spoke to told me something different. Supervisors have no authority to do anything.  I spoke to one rep for one hour and 55 minutes and two days later they refused to honor exception she promised. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CURRENT CARRIER, YOU WILL REGRET IT. I cant wait to get out of this contract.",0
"Att is absolutely garbage,  customer service the worst,  coverage really bad! I have the unlimited plan and I have no data most of the time,  really is time for a change after more than 8 years,  completely disappointed!!@",0
These guys suck absolute ass. Does not matter how many bars you have your service will always be dogshit. Not consistent whatsoever.,0
Horrible! Crooks! You have services and when services interrupted you are still required to pay for something you were unable to use. Both my landline and internet have been put for OVER a month and yet I'm still billed. More then likely will be canceling the landline and looking for another internet service provider! My internet rate just went up another $5! I'm looking to email Elon musk and vivek ramaswamy to see if they can look into att and pge in California! Been with att for a very long time but no more!!!,0
"I had to chose 1 star to star a review, in reality they deserve 0 or a minus.Worst company I have ever been affiliated with.  Can't wait till my contract is up to get the hell out.They are sharks and will try to charge you for stuff they did not even provide.Think twice before switching to ATT",0
"I was trying to take advantage of the plans through Costco offering new phones signed up for him, and after four hours at the kiosk and talking to multiple customer service reps at their 833 number I was ready to throw all the phones through one of the TVs at Costco. Worst customer service ever, I was hopeful after 17 year hiatus from AT&T. Their customer service has improved. It’s only gotten worse. Do not do business with them.",0
"At&t has been steadily increasing my home internet bill for the past months. They are constantly sending notifications about getting air internet which I refuse. For the first 2 years with them, the line was bad because of faulty installment on their part, until they rewire. They didn't compensate me for the loss and I let it slip but yet they are increasing my bill basically every month.",0
"The AT&T that is at Costco is a HUGE Scam. They will tell you ANYTHING to get you to join their service. We traded in our own PAID OFF (new) phones, to get new ""free"" phones. When the new iPhone came out we wanted to gift our phones to someone and buy new phones, they charged us $1200 each phone which means we got ZERO value for the phones we gave them. ALL because they FAILED to tell us the conditions that came with the phones. They just wanted us to get to sign the contract. I AM BEYOND disappointed. The customer service was nice but they literally did NOTHING.",0
"I paid my brothers phone bill until his death on Sunday. I asked ATT to cancel that line. Kelly was extremely helpful and courteous. I upgraded my phones last June and the young man added another line to my account that was at no additional cost to me. I decided to cancel that line as well. Problem was he attached the installment plan for my upgraded phone to the new number. ATT will not attach the installment to my original phone number so to cancel that line I have to pay the phone off ($555.00). Lesson learned, ATT just sucks and I would advise you not to use them. You’re welcome.",0
WISH I COULD GIVE A MINUS REVIEW. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,0
I would give zero Stars if I could this company is scamming. their fees are outrageous and they're not detailed whatsoever they completely get you on late fees and reconnection fees 2 months after you had thought bill was paid in full they are completely unclear and they lie when you talk to them through service,0
"Already regretting about changing to AT&T. They offered me a bundle credit and trade in credits but what no one told me was that credits appeared 2-3 billing cycles after, so I’ll be paying way more money for that than what I originally agreed to pay until the credits are applied, who knows when. Don’t fall for it !!!",0
"’ve been a loyal AT&T customer for over 15 years, but my recent experience has left me deeply disappointed. I participated in a phone trade-in program for $700, only to find out a few days later that the trade-in value for my phone had increased to $830. When I reached out to customer service to request an adjustment, I was met with a flat refusal to honor the updated trade-in value.What made the situation even more frustrating was the lack of willingness to escalate my concern. The representatives I spoke with were unhelpful and outright refused to transfer me to another department or supervisor who might have been able to assist.After more than a decade of loyalty, I expected AT&T to value its customers enough to provide fair consideration for situations like this. Sadly, their rigid policies and poor customer service have shown me otherwise. I am now seriously reconsidering my long-term relationship with AT&T.",0
"Worst telephone company, and dishonest. After decades of being a customer I finally changed carrier.Tired of dishonest charges, and the terrible customer service the client ends up paying for. And, it only keeps getting more and more expensive for its unreliable services.If I could give a no star I would.When I called to close my account, I was not told, ATT doesn’t prorate. I just found out today they will keep the money for 3 weeks of prepaid service on a closed account.Shame on them.Just like they read all their promotion scripts to clients, they could have more respect for us, and also read conditions and results to the changes we are considering, before we make a final decision.But then again, that ends up costing us more money, but making  ATT  even more easy money. Sickening.",0
AT and T customer call services have been awful. They promise one thing only to find out they are not able to fulfill an over the verbal promise. Their charges for returning the phone which was supposed to lower my monthly bill only to be charged 638.00 in separate charges within 3 days don't even know what once they recieved my card# - I have been with them for over 3 years .  They dropped the ball and can't believe they can do this and get away with it for now. Just awful !This is an update: I did leave AT and T and yesterday they refunded me the shipping fee of 130.00 they charged me.,0
"AT&T experienced several data breaches compromising customer information.  3 days following one such breach, an account was opened in my name without my knowledge or permission.  I explained this to customer service and they had me fill out a form and file a police report.  Nevertheless, they denied the form and said I was still responsible for payment! They sent it to collections and have not removed it.  AT&T has permamently lost my busuness and I highly recommend avoiding business with this company.",0
"We have been customers of AT&T wireless for years, but due to the high charges for AT&T we opted to go to another carrier. It took 4 phone calls to AT&T, with numerous persons, and many lies on AT&T's part. We finally contacted our new carrier explaining that AT&T would not unlock our cell phones (which we own!!). Once contacted by our new carrier AT&T shut off our service with no notice. I have congestive heart failure, so AT&T's lack of customer service and shutting down our cell phones was unacceptable and medically dangerous to me!!!  I urge anyone thinking of using AT&T to go somewhere else and use any other company!!! AT&T is lucky we are not contacting an attorney regarding the phone turn off, when our account is paid out for another 2 weeks!!!!",0
"Att completely misrepresented there policy. We switched to att and we're given free phones , however they were not free and upon upgrade we had to pay over $100 to pay off our free phone. This was unexpected and a hardship as we live on ss. If I had been informed we would have never switched, now we're screwed for another 18 months. I advise not to do business with att and and avoid there deception.",0
Cancelled internet. They will not pro rate the bill. Cell phone service also sucks,0
"I've never had any other service than AT&T, my landline back in the day with Bell Telephone, then it changed to AT&T... We're talking forever ago.  No more, switched to T-Mobile and was made a happy customer the first day.  Sick of the dishonest business tactics and overcharges almost monthly with AT&T.",0
"Stay away from AT&T and FIRSTNET. Horrible. They disconnect my number by mistake of AT&t and took me over 10 days reconnect. HORRIBLE. Their agents don’t know nothing , just know say: “ sorry about your situation but we can’t do nothing “ ( In 10 days period I talked with almost 25 Agents from all their service departments, and nobody can’t do nothing about their own mistake. -STAY AWAY FROM AT&T-",0
"AT&T required my 95-year-old mother with dementia to come down to the store to authenticate her ID simply to activate a new SIM card because she misplaced her phone.    Even though the store employees said, I could do it over the phone, AT&T customer service, In all of their wisdom, required them to send an authentication code to her phone. The lost phone!! They would not do it through email. They verified her Social Security number. They spoke with her on the phone. But they’re still going to require her to come down to the store for a new SIM card. Until then she has no phone. I will never use AT&T.",0
Unbelievably bad. Tried to do a simple transfer of billing responsibility to move off my sister’s account. My sister completed the TOBR and I was told twice that it was completed. But no transfer. Called for the 4th time and customer service now says they cannot see the TOBR and I will have to start the process for the third time. Absolutely ridiculous.  Total wast of my time (3hours!!). Hopefully three times is the charm. Do better ATT!!!!!!!,0
This company is a liar and dishonest and has no honor in business. They said that I could upgrade my phone for free and would only have to pay an $11 difference to get a 512GB phone since my previous phone was 128GB. Then after a month they discounted it over the phone and I will not be able to cancel the contract because they set me to pay in 36 installments. My experience with this company was very unpleasant because I felt like an idiot for trusting this unscrupulous company.,0
Worst customer service ever !!! We are switching back to t mobile.  The service is good they cost less . Good coverage.  At&t is just expensive for nothing.,0
"Absolutely horrendous. I ordered new phones for me and my brother and got a significant holiday discount, but it was delivered 3 days during the work week, but it requires a signature, so I obviously missed all 3 days because I'm at work. Due to this, our phones were sent back to where they were shipped from. I called both AT&T and UPS and both told us there is nothing we can do. The AT&T agent I spoke with even was placing the blame on me for not being home. I am at WORK in the middle of the day. I have zero way of being home if I am working. Some of the worst customer service dealt with, and now I have to start the ordering process all over again. If you are thinking of getting a new phone through AT&T, please reconsider.",0
"Did an upgrade with ATT online after the local store was out of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. It was shipped by RLC today via Fedex. It requires a signature and every restriction possible. Fedex says ATT needs to call them to allow holding it at the local Walgreens, but ATT says they can't do that. Fedex also doesn't allow the option to deliver at a time when I'll be home. I work all day from 8-5pm. I've told both Fedex and ATT that they can cancel my order and ship the item back. I will not sign the door tag to have it left at my residence. The ATT rep was very nice I talked to, but this is a systemic failure by both ATT and Fedex. UPS is great and I've never had issues with them. I'd switch to another carrier, but unfortunately, ATT is the only carrier with service where I live. Fedex is a complete joke and I avoid them like the plaque. There is a reason UPS delivers more packages then them.",0
"I am beyond frustrated with AT&T's customer service. They seem to be deliberately delaying everything, making even the simplest tasks unnecessarily difficult. No matter what issue I have, it takes forever to get a resolution. The lack of communication and helpfulness from their support team is infuriating. It feels like they don't care about their customers at all. The culture at AT&T seems focused on creating obstacles rather than finding solutions. I would not recommend this company to anyone based on my experience. They make everything harder than it should be.",0
"Sent my son in Western Blvd, Jacksonville NC store to purchase a iPhone 16. I told him no contracts, fees, just buy it, Merry Christmas! Associate said it’s a FREE upgrade! Being a new consumer he did not understand how AT&T is grossly misrepresented aka lie. I went back in the store the same day to cancel. Associate said it must be the manager and she is busy, it’s going to be a while. I said fine, how else can I cancel? Call 611. I called on my way home -and they were closed until Monday. I went online to view order and cancel. (Help said there will be a cancel button if it hadn’t shipped and it was the same day hours after the order and it hadn’t shipped. I continued to check for the button.) The next day 8am CST I texted on my app to cancel = reply sorry can’t help you, I called 611 and waited 20-30 minutes = reply sorry can’t help you. They said call the local store, the associate said you must come in and speak to the manager. Easy to purchase, very difficult to cancel. Reminds me a lot of the old Gym memberships when the Gym made it very difficult to cancel, time consuming, and there was a fee. Now I have to receive the iPhone and return it and there is Restocking fee. I thought I did my due diligence to cancel, ordered Sunday 2pm. I went back to the store the next day (29th) Monday on Western Blvd and the manager CANNOT CANCEL it. According to AT&T, NO ONE in the universe can stop the phone from shipping, the store, the texting line or any leadership at AT&T. GOOD NEWS this inspired me to quit overpaying for services, $110 mo for 2 lines (w/discounts) changed to $30 a month same features. Perspective- Annual savings $960, over a decade $10,000.",0
Horrible service they suck and don’t let u buy nothing they make my life hell and canceling my service as soon as possible because of there messed  up service,0
"AT&T has nowhere to file a complaint and BBB won’t let you either because they are not accredited with the BBB. I have spent over 1 hour trying. Their customer service is the worse ever because it doesn’t exist. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone unless you like not being able to talk to anyone unless you are trying to set up service. If you set up service get ready to be engorged on everything.They don’t give a crap about customer service. If you don’t believe me just try yourself. I don’t know how they stay in business. Trust me, you will be sorry if you sine up with them.",0
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICEMy home was destroy during the storm in September, a tree fell on my roof.I called to cancel the service and I was instructed to pay the month and returned the equipment. Two months later I had to call back to cancel the service again, this time they wanted me to pay 2 months to cancel, they said there’s no record o notes of the cancellation, I had a record of UPS for the returned equipment and record of the call and they still wanted to pay,It was a natural disaster and we still working on rebuilding our home, these people don’t care about their customers. They just Don’t care at all.",0
Had to call the help line 6+ times to get a fan pin number. They provided several different pin numbers that were incorrect and seemed to have no idea what they were doing.,0
"I had to click the 1 star just to be able to leave a review, but I wouldn't give them this much credit! Leo, the representative that I had the misfortune of speaking with, was incredibly rude and very hostile. I work in a call center myself and I have NEVER in my life dealt with someone who was so unprofessional! If he was not hacking in the phone, he was cutting me off and telling me ""Just go to the store"". I had told him multiple times I went to the store for the same issue and the store clerk told me they were not able to assist me because it has to be done through the customer service line. I have been a loyal customer of AT&T for 15 years, but I will no longer be using them. HORRIBLE!!!!",0
"I've been without internet since Christmas Eve.  While AT&T employees were at home enjoying their internet, paying customers were at home WITHOUT working internet.  AT&T is not communicating with customers regarding restoration times.  I'm paying for internet service that I cannot use.",0
"This company is a good example of the oligarchies that are bringing this country to its knees. It is all about money, not customer service or quality.IF they let you talk to an agent (and it's nearly impossible), they employ overseas ESL agents you can barely understand and, though they're SUPER ready to add additional services, their internal communication sucks so bad that your bill is always messed up and separated.They sold me on internet, spent 45 minutes on the phone with me, and then sent me only part of the equipment I needed and told me to set up myself.",0
"I've had AT&T mobile for 19 years. Since I was 17 years old. I didn't know any better then. Now, having had multiple screw ups at a store with upgrades, unauthorized plan changes, or always some new hidden fee with a ""free upgrade"" that was not disclosed up front. I'm both a Servicemember and a Student, and They tried to scam me previously with the first net deal. Only a National Guard or LEO 1ST responder with an account code can use this, NOT ACTIVE DUTY.I ordered a phone for a ""free"" upgrade online where they said I would pay 0.99 a month on my monthly bill for. I added the one time fee.Somehow that turned into a plan change and a $60 month regular upcharge.My monthly plan equates to that of a car payment or gas for one vehicle for a month. This is insane. They are driving customers to their competitors..It gets much worse when you get into fiber or Uverse. I was billed monthly for fiber, but the installer used a broadband network switch that is not capable of fiber.Its a trend of over promising and under delivering with hidden fees. The service has always been great. But their total net profit vs what we spend is unacceptable.Secondly, I spent over $2000 on an Asus Rog 7 phone, then a Planet Astro slide 5G- both certified on their network, but quietly blacklisted.. After their site was showing compatibility. I mentioned it in their ATT forums that they conveniently sunsetted.I do not pay for a service to decide if I buy a phone thru them or not, I pay for a network. They ripped me off whether I used their devices or not.No matter who you go with carrier wise, bring your own device- one with global, freeware. Stop buying overpriced low tier devices.",0
"Having used AT&T as my US cell phone provider for 9 years now, I feel that I finally have to put fingers to keyboard and highlight how utterly abysmal their customer service is.  They have twice in that time just randomly removed my cell phone number (and the first time they did that, they also stole the $100 of credit that was on the account).  When they do delete your number it then becomes extremely difficult to get through to anyone in customer service and, if (BIG IF) you do manage to get through to someone, they are often unable to help resolve the issue.  I am totally p****d with having to change cell phone number and update all my professional stationary, profiles and contacts because of AT&T's complete disregard for their customers.  The question is, who else to try?  These giant communications companies have a virtual monopoly and they couldn't care less about their customers.",0
If there is any negative minus 5 star rating? One of the worst network service.Total waste garbage network.Pathetic customer service.I am with customer care for past 1hr20 min and still unable to resolve the issue.,0
ATT WHEN I FURST SIGNED UP WITH THEM I WAS TOLD WHAT MY MONTHLY BILL WOULD BE. Then it kept changing over time getting higher and higher. I’m on a fixed budget so I’m can’t afford that. Representative would talk to me and tell what they want you to hear. Brings your rate down and by the next month it’s high again. They are a predatory carrier and misleading customers to pay higher prices. Debit your account without permission. Worst service ever. All of 2024 it’s been increases. To my bill.,0
"I have had AT T internet for two years. One day it’s disconnected, not for payment but for “upgrade”. You call and is put on hold for 2 hours. Nobody knows why or this department can’t help , have to transfer you to another. Then after all that , we still had to make an appointment for new equipment, School was on break, family members from out of town was there and no Tv. They didn’t even credit the bill or care that we were out of service for long. It wasn’t even our fault but we had to endure. Please go to CSpire or TMobile. It’s just not worth the high payment here. As soon as our contract ends, we are DONE.!!!!!",0
"I am not exaggerating, if I ever need something changed on my account it takes no less than 2 hours to take care of. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. I have been with the company for a long time and at first I thought maybe it was an isolated issue but it is apparent that AT&T does not value service or customer satisfaction. It takes a miracle to get someone on the phone then usually it is the wrong department and you need to be transferred or the reps don't know what they are doing. I hate complaining about the employees to me it's a management issue.",0
"Impossible to cancel the e-SIM, they make you wait for half an hour on the phone and they tell you I pass you the cancellation departement and you are back to the main menu. I was in the US on holiday and then went back to Europe and couldn't go to a shop to cancel it. From Europe I called the shop and they said I had to call customer service and never could resign from them. People, don't waste your money and time with such bastards!!! On the website impossible to cancel, on the app neither. To pay and for all other services they give info, but to cancel it no way. People, never give them your card number, nothing!!!!!!! They deserve to fail!",0
"I experienced a total loss of my phone and it has been a nightmare dealing with ATT. I forgot my pin on top of everything and they don't believe that I am who I say that I am. I even visited a retail location with my government issued ID, and they would still not provide clearance to my account. After two days of getting the run around, somehow thankfully I remembered the magical PIN number. Onto the next step of filing the insurance claim. Easier said than done. They promised the phone the next day by 4pm only to have it delayed two more days. Total of 4 days without said phone that I paid insurance on. The phone finally arrives today but now I am unable to activate the device because I don't have the old phone to receive the two factor authorization. Now I'm told that I have to go back to the store after the store initially told me they couldn't help me. This experience has to be a sick joke.",0
"I switched to VErizon bc they decided to raise my rates. I did so before my next bill. They charged me $400 and are telling me I cannot get a refund for 31 days!!! Also, never get their Internet Air...it is too slow and there are not options for faster speeds.",0
Wish I could give less than one star. Every month I have hundreds of extra dollars in fees on both home internet and phone bill. Not one single month have I ever paid what they said in the agreement.Att has to be the absolute worst customer service as I am on the phone with them at least once a month for the past year. Hands down the worst service I have ever received since day 1. I wish I could rate 0 stars.,0
"I will never do business with AT&T again. They offer you promotions and then they don’t honor them. You spend hours on the phone with their reps, trying to get them to honor their promotions. Sometimes you succeed, but sometimes you fail and that is not acceptable for them to treat customers like that. I got an iPad based on a promotion that I was promised, and they never honored it. I called them several times over the course of eight months and they never honored their word. So, I finally got frustrated enough after hours on the phone with their customer care people that I cancelled the line because they didn’t honor what they had promised. Of course they promise these things, but don't put them in writing.After all this, then they had the gall to charge me a disconnect fee. I will never do business with this company again. And for the record, this was a transaction through an actual AT&T corporate store.",0
"My phone malfunctioned, so I went in for assistance. They provided me with a temporary phone and informed me that I only needed to pay for an additional line. They also mentioned that I must return it within 14 days; otherwise, I would be charged for the entire phone. I complied, but now they are claiming that I need to pay for it and that I agreed to a 36-month lease. I was never informed about this, and I feel like I was deceived. Bc Im paying for 2 phones now $160 a month",0
"They are horrible , a barrage wait time on the phone is 2 hours , took them 2 days to hook up wifi to my house while previously it would take about 3 hours , they don’t communicate or compensate, do not waste your money here, you’re better off using your data.",0
"I had a representative come to my home, and said he could lower my monthly cell bill. I had T Mobile with a $178 mo. payment. Now my bill is now $214. a month, instead of the $150 that was stated at the  time that I transferred over. I  explained to the representative that I was retiring soon, and I'd like to my bills as low as possible, since I'd be on a fixed income. I feel I was mislead and lied to about the service I received.  I contacted the Customer Service line and wasn't able to get the bill any lower. I also blame myself for listening to someone tell me the amount of the bill, when there was nothing in writing about the monthly statement until after everything was signed. And I got an email in a few days.",0
"Internet went down for no apparent reason so I contacted customer service (useless chatbot) that went between telling me to turn it off and on and telling me there's an outage in the area (there wasnt). Scheduled a tech for following day and of course they failed to show in the FOUR HOUR window and the ""customer rep"" tood me the have no idea why the tech is late or where they are. Beyond pathetic and incompetent customer service.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with the experience I’ve had with your customer agents. They have demonstrated incompetence and misled me into agreements without transparency. Despite my specific service requests, they chose to proceed differently. Due to these issues, I have decided to cancel my lines.",0
This is the worst company to try and do business with. Can't speak to live people. Haven't had internet from the time I paid for it. They want me to pay my bill before they will even talk to me. Not paying bill because they haven't delivered product. I still have no internet. Waiting for it to go to collection and maybe I can speak to someone about selling something that actually works. Can't pay for promises and lies,0
"I finally cancelled AT&T after my bill increased to nearly $70 for basic wifi. I forgot to turn off the automatic bill pay and got charged for internet I didn’t even have anymore. When I called the lady gave me the run around and basically told me they don’t cancel auto pay for you, you have to do that yourself. I straight up told her that’s sneaky and really shady. She didn’t say much. Anyway, I was supposed to get a $65 refund but only ended up getting $47. I also waited 10 weeks for a stupid debit card instead of them just refunding my bank account. Idk how AT&T is still in business. They’re greedy and don’t give a flying **** about their customers.",0
I've been a customer with AT&T for more than seven years. And they won't let me split my payments monthly.,0
I have been a loyal customer for years. I called to have a line added to my account for my grandson. I was told there were system issues. I received the Service Agreement but not the signature page. I called back and agent was rude. Tried to convince me that I was called twice to follow up. I have NO messages from AT&T.,0
I just didnt like the service!!,0
The customer service at AT&T leaves a lot of these desired. I called the customer service number and asked for a call Back. They said it would take between nine and 17 minutes and now I’m at Three hours. This is truly lousy service. I think I will switch my My wireless carrier😡,0
"A customer for over 5 years and now looking for alternatives.Today on December 10th, 2024 contacted AT&T about my cellular bill with a discrepancy about a charge.Recently, I had upgraded my wife’s phone at our local store in Elizabethtown, KY.I was already frustrated when I was finally seen because although I had got an appointment online, the store was not managing appointments and walk-in’s were being taken before me. I was seen 30 minutes later than my appointment.The gentlemen did well to defuse the situation and I ended up leaving with an iPhone 16 plus and iPad.Today I checked my billing to go over all the fees. The iPhone bundle that I opted allowed those who purchased the new IPhone 6 Pro to receive an IPAD for 99 cents a month. The bill I have reflects a price that was three times as much.Originally we were going to get the iPhone 6 Pro; however, the sales associate stated that the one we wanted was not in stock but the brought the iPhone 6 Plus out and informed me that the deal was the same.Flash forward back to today. Customer service looked up my deal. And no they will not honor the deal. The store told misinformed me. And they could only offer apologies.This shows me that they have zero accountability and offer very little remedy discrepancies.",0
"AT&T cut my internet line when they connected my new neighbor’s service. Instead of fixing the line, the service guy left it. I had to take a day off of work for them to come back out and reconnect the service. The service guy said they would bury the line within 10 business days. It has been a month. AT&T caused the problem and still has not finished the work. AT&T should do better! Poor Service!",0
"I signed up with att to have service my mobile hotspot serviced just 8 days ago and decided to cancel it because the wifi service in my house isso weak.  It is a complete nightmare to cancel.  I’ve been ping ponged left and right.  Att should be embaressed for their business practices.  Stay away from ATT, they do not care about service.  I hope they go out of busines!",0
The most terrible 😢 company ever. Call centers only over in India they don’t even speak English. This should be a crime.,0
Worst piece of shit service there is. I literally get no good service no matter where I go unless it’s a big city with 5g. There service locations are terrible. We pay way too much money for such shit service.,0
"After they persuade me to switch and sign up, they would not honor any of the promised discounts. Not just the store, even the FirstNet customer support line. I am not satisfied the way ATT handles my questions ever since I switched. i tried multiple times, in store and on the phone. I regret for sig ing up. I would not advise any one else to come here. I can not wait to leave them. I",0
Att is a thief. They just want money. I just have had att for three months and then transferred my lines to another service. They only attract the customer at the beginning and later on you have to pay much more than what they committed. I hated att in these three months and I am very happy to transfer the service. Never never never trust att agents and the services. They are liars.,0
Their service is always down and I've had then come out at least six times this year for the same issue.,0
"I made a payment agreement with AT&T paying the amount of $349.95 for November 28, 2024 and the other for $348.24 for December 12, 2024. It turns out that AT&T broke the payment agreement by charging me twice on the same day, the 28th, for both amounts. I contacted them for a refund but they don't want to give it to me because of their policies.",0
"I was scammed by someone working inside ATT. Someone called me with full information on my account, including the fact that I had called a week earlier to inquire about lowering my bill. The rep said that ATT wanted to keep their loyal customers. Texts were arriving from the ATT thread. I was offered a significant discount.  Long story short, I gave my credit card info. Shortly after that, I received a notification from my bank that  $240 was charged to my card. I became suspicious and called my bank and ATT. This began a now 2 month process of trying to get refunded. The case was verified as fraudulent by ATT. Their executive office contacted me and assured everything would be taken care of.  Since then, I have called multiple times and spoken to many individuals.  Each individual personally was nice but collectively, horrible customer service. Every person told me something different. As if each person is reading from a different book. Currently, 2 months have passed; still no refund. They care less about loosing a very long time customer, like me. Anyone know how to contact the executive department and not the robots?",0
Have had the worst week with your company had to schedule  three appointments  in one week 1st day technician  José didn't  even step foot in my house  yet he said he fixed my internet i asmueed it was goibg to work which he didn't had to schedule  for the next day the appointment  was scheduled  from 4 to 8 yet same technician came from 315 to 345 I didn't ask for that time. Called your  800 numerous  times was supposed to have a wait  time of 3 to 4 minutes  which  ended up being  a hour and half called back  again for a call back got called back to be  put on hold again for 20 minutes 3rd appointment  which  I was going to be charged a $99 dispatch  I was home second appointment  at time I requested not my fault your stupid tech can't tell time I requested  4 not 3 3rd day tech was very helpful now. I'm  trying to suspend my internet and I can't do that for some reason I have no internet  connection  from my computer  I need to get my computer fixed  so I guess I have to cancel my service with your crappy company  since I can't suspend it,0

I was told I was going to get the phones for free .I was told I would get a $250 gift card per line for switching To pay off my own line , and that my bill would be cheaper than I was paying.

"Went to Target to what I thought was a consumer cellular place to get a phone as mine was broken. The sales person “Steven” stated that AT&T was owner of Consumer Cellular. I know that Consumer Cellular does contract with them to use their cell towers.Anyways, we are filling out paperwork and as it was taking so long, I kept asking that this was not a new account that I just wanted to buy a new phone. He stated that was right no new contract.He was sending the phone to my house and I kept asking why I could not get one that was for sale right there. He gave me this long winded response.After getting home I read the document that he sent me and he lied, he set me up with a new AT&T account not the same Consumer Cellular one I had. I called and asked him about this and he lied again and said it was Consumer Cellular.I called Consumer Cellular to see where my phone was and they stated they had no order for a phone. I explained what happens and they said that what he stated was not true.I called Steven back and he stated that phone was on the way so he could not cancel the acct as I had to send back the phone when I got it. Now I only have 14 days to cancel this acct. not only that they can charge me a restocking fee as I cannot bring it back to the store that I ordered it from.These people are just scam artist. I have been sitting on the phone for an hr. And no one has picked up so I can cancel this acct.NEVER USE ATT&T!!  SCAM",0
"Almost an unimaginably low level of customer service.  Once you are lucky enough to actually talk to a service representative, they appear to be friendly and willing to address your issue.  But appearances are deceiving, as are the commitments made by the representatives.Do not trust or believe anything the service rep says or promises.  Get it in writing.  Oh, wait, they won't put it in writing, and they won't check the calls that are supposedly ""recorded for quality control"" to see what kind of lies the rep told you as an inducement to get or keep you as a customer.I have been fighting with AT&T since March in an attempt to have them honor the price concession they promised as an incentive for my purchase of an IPhone 15 Pro Max.  To date, there is still no resolution.  Each representative spoken with gives the same standard BS response, namely that the case has been approved, and it will take 2 to 3 billing cycles for the appropriate credits to appear.Thinking of using AT&t as your mobile carrier?Expect the worst, and you will not be disappointed.",0
"I would give them a zero if I could. We had ATT for business phones, they sent a representative to our office named Jarod that said he had a great deal and we should switch to their cell service. We changed and were told and sent a paper that our bill would be $290 - much to our surprise the bill was $1600. We have made several attempts to get them to contact us and also to went to a store to get this fixed.  We were told they could make sure this transition would be easy and smooth and I asked three times that the $290 would be my first bill. Do not listen to this garbage and the billing that they screw you out of your money and then give you some crap that months up the road your bill will be lower!",0
"WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ATT❓ The customer service the last couple of years has gotten progressively worse!I have invested hours trying to speak to a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPERVISOR!No matter how many times you say ‘Customer Service’ you are routed to ANDY…which only half works in any given day! Then you are transferred to a recording that gives you an option for a ‘call back’…one that never comes!SO YOU START OVER JUST TO KEEP BEING LOOPED AROUND AND AROUND! FINALLY GET SOMEONE AND CAN’T UNDERSTAND MOST OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING!This company has sent a clear message that they do not care about us as customers and ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!I left Sprint over 20 plus years ago and my family came to ATT because the customer service was so bad! ONLY RECENTLY HAS ATT BASICALLY BECOME THEM IN HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!It is so frustrating to have to spend this much time trying to get through to someone! My daughter was smart enough to leave 5 years ago to T Mobile and we were too stupid to leave! Because we have been with ATT for more than 20 years, I tried to hang but it’s time! This is outrageous!",0

"In August of this year, I visited an AT&T store in Grand Junction, CO, to set up four new lines. While assisting me, the representative suggested I also consider switching my home internet to AT&T’s new 5G Wireless service, claiming it would be just as good as my current provider. I was assured that I could try the service risk-free for a week, and if I wasn’t satisfied, I could return the equipment without being charged.Shortly after receiving the equipment in the mail, I installed it and ran a speed test to compare it to my existing internet. The results were disappointing—the speed was not even half of what I was currently getting. I immediately packed up the AT&T equipment and sent it back the next day.Since my bill was on autopay, I assumed that returning the equipment would resolve everything. However, I later discovered that AT&T continued to charge me monthly even though they received the equipment—something a representative confirmed on the phone today (12/16/2024). When I asked for a refund, they told me I needed to have officially canceled the service either by phone or through the website, in addition to returning the equipment.To make matters worse, they claimed they could only issue a refund if I provided the UPS return receipt, despite already confirming they had received the equipment. They insisted this was company policy and that nothing could be done without it.This entire situation has been incredibly frustrating. I expected better customer service and accountability from AT&T. As a result, I’m taking my business elsewhere, and I hope AT&T reconsiders policies like this that only serve to drive customers away.",0
"Bought a iphone thru the ATT app. Didn't like it. Return started the next day. AWFUL. Chat told me to return at ATT store. Went to store. Said I couldn't return it there because the app was ""a different company""??? Back to Chat. Sent me UPS label. Dropped at UPS. UPS tracking said delivered. 5 days later, it was returned to me with no info. Chat again. Sent me another UPS label. Dropped off at UPS. UPS said delivered. Chat said no info on return for 3 weeks! Finally get email saying return received - nothing further to do, any charges will be removed. Next bill - upgrade charges, new installment plan, tax on new phone there. Chat again. Said maybe it would be removed on the next bill!!!! This was insane. The people on Chat don't know anything. ATT doesn't know what it's doing. Can NEVER talk to a person on the phone despite waiting for hours. All together - spent at least 10-15 hours on multiple days on this problem and each time nothing was resolved, just messed up more. It's really ridiculous, frustrating,  and impossible.",0
This is the worse internet service ever. It has been off for 12 hours so far and now I am told it will be at least another 12. Possibly more. Spectrum cost more and now I know why! You get what you pay for. I will be going back to Spectrum.,0

"I bought their products and canceled my existing service because they promised my bills would be much lower. However, I soon discovered it was all a lie. My first bill was over $700, while I had been paying $240 for five phones with T-Mobile. They also promised my internet would be $65 per month, but they charged me $85 instead. I regretted it so much and had to return all the phones and cancel my internet service with them. All of this cost me money because they don’t offer credits or partial refunds, even if you never used their equipment.Please be aware of the salespeople at Walmart; they will do anything to sell you their product, and the bill ends up being completely different from what you agreed to. AT&T really sucks. Their service is terrible, and they don’t even try to help you with credits. They will take your money. So, if you have a good phone plan or internet, please don’t switch—your costs will double or even triple. their samesman ARE SCAMMERS!!",0
"AT&T are 💩 they have to be they now own SKY, VIRGIN MEDIA and 02 the service for Broadband breaks down all the time and they charge double what BT does all I can say avoid them like the plague and If you have service with them then CEASE IT as you can't trust the RIP OFF MERCHANT WHO ARE WORSER THAN KCON!",0
It is the worst experiences I’ve ever had to deal with AT&T for both Internet and cellphone services.,0
"THE WORST COMPANY ON EARTH!  I have been a business customer with 5 lines from AT&T for over 20 years. In the last several years I have been over charged numerous times with very suspect charges. They changed my plan on me without telling me and my bill was much larger. I have spent countless hours on the phone attempting with AT&T trying to resolve these issues. When I say countless I mea 6 hours + in one day. No one has time for that!  They are MASTERS of the transfer, meaning they will claim they can't help you and transfer you to the next person. My most recent bill had sneaky charges for services I NEVER received. They are an extremely deceptive company!  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND them to anyone! Unless you love being completely frustrated and wasting hours of your life and getting no answers- STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM AT&TI happily moved to T-MOBILE and they have been great. It cost me money to move but it has totally been worth it.  Good Luck.",0
"Our experience with AT&T has been extremely disappointing. On two occasions, they have proven to be an untrustworthy company that disregards their customers. Here’s what happened:We traded in our iPhones and shipped them as instructed. The shipment was received by AT&T’s warehouse, but they claimed they only received one iPhone, even though our shipment clearly showed the correct weight. Despite being loyal AT&T customers for five years, they refused to give us the trade-in credit for the new iPhones and made us pay out of pocket.This has happened to us twice when trading in phones. Each time, they essentially stole our money. We called multiple managers, and one initially acknowledged the issue and applied the credit to our account. However, a higher-level manager later removed the credit, blocked our phone, and restricted our account. When we called to address the issue, we were told that a manager had removed the credit and blocked us.This behavior is unacceptable. If someone in their warehouse stole our phone or mishandled our trade-in, it is not the customer’s fault. Instead, they falsely accused us of not shipping the item. This shows a complete lack of professionalism and integrity.AT&T’s poor handling of this situation, combined with their employees’ and managers’ unprofessional behavior, is unacceptable. We will be sharing our story widely, and many of our friends have already decided to leave AT&T because of this. They are a bad company with unethical practices, and we cannot recommend them to anyone.",0
Worst customer service ever I sat on the phone with a woman who could barely speak English and she did not assist me she just cancelled the order and said well we can do it over if u have all the required documents,0
"I wish if I can give less than one starIt is a company that scams people watch your bank account every month .Looking to move to other companyAT&T, it’s a scamming company",0
"Liars.  Do not trust AT&T.  Several lies from the salespersons telling us to sign up for the upgrade, and in the end new phones cost $690more than if we had walked in off the street.  Phones we just purchased are now worth a fraction of the price we paid.  Scammers.  THIEVES.  They will take as much money from you as you let them!!",0
"AT&T The worst Internet provider we have ever had slow Internet, Cuts all the time, Horrible customer service, Lied About gift cards and tricked us into switching the phone line Saying it would be cheaper, but it absolutely wasn’t We are paying ridiculous amounts per month For a terrible service Absolutely do not recommend go any other provider Their sales team uses lies and deception To get you to sign up. We are going to cancel the service immediately and go with any other provider",0
"They had me finance 2 phones without telling me what i was agreeing to.Told the att door to door salesmen I couldn't afford anything new sence I was prego and recently lost my job. He said i could save money. Was told if recieve a 200$ gift card for signing up but I could use it to get 2 new phones along side the internet, without paying extra and it was a promotion. By the time the first bill came i found out they had me finance 2 $750 phones. Was past 14 days and too late to return it. No mention was made that I was financing and I asked multiple times of there was a contract now stuck paying $186 a month for 2 phones for the next 3 years. (Not to mention the separate internet bill)The guy kept talking so friendly an had me distracted as I signed everything on his tablet and never once said I was financing the phones. Let me believe the gift card covered them.cost before att $40 for 2 phone lines and 70 for net now im paying 186+85Att guy heard my old ammount and still made me think i was getting a better deal. He only spoke of one bill not that it was 2 separate bills.Apparently there was an email sent to my fiancé that showed copy's of what I signed but I didn't know till it was too late. They should have been upfront telling me and I never would have agreed.I do NOT need a $700+ phone with my 6 year old playing around with it. I thought it was 2 $100 phones.",0
"My internet went out a couple of days ago.  I work during the day so all I really did was try to fix it myself. I called the number and I got the robot. It went through some testing that didn't work so I had to call back and it did some more testing which disconnected me and it didn't work either.  I called back this morning and the same thing..A ROBOT. Didn't work again. I called customer service and I opted for a call back tat never came.  I called back again and waited on hold for 45 min.  I got an Indian who I could barely understand but she was nice.  She did a couple more tests and said there was an outage in the area.  I looked at outages before I called and there wasn't any.  I work Monday thru Friday 30 miles away and I have to give 24 hr notice to be off. I can't just leave.I had to set it up for Tuesday.  I am without internet for 5 days.  Not only do they need to get more humans on the phone, they need to get people we can understand.  Have your repair people work on weekends for your customers..ATT sure knows how to take your money but the respect for their customers is nonexistent.",0
Att has one of the worst international plans. They absolutely do not value their customers,0
"This has got to be the worst phone company on planet earth. They screw up my account and then can't fix it. I can be in the middle of working on the computer, be in my email checking things, go to a different tab for less than five minutes and it will log me out randomly saying ""it looks like you stepped away so we logged you out for security reasons. WHAT SECURITY REASONS???, I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING WITH IT!!! STEPPED AWAY MY DONKEY TAIL! Then it takes forever to get logged back in because of all the issues with my account that they created. I end up having to call ATT and have to hang on the phone for an hour or more. I have literally spent hours on the phone trying to fix one problem - removing an old email as a recovery email. People do stuff that they don't know what they are doing and then no one can fix it. If it weren't so problematic changing your email on so many different things I would have switched a long time ago. It is now reaching the point where it will be worth it. The people are poorly trained, but are trying to make points to move up and do things they have no idea how it will affect the rest of the account or how to undo it. This company is not at all customer focused. If I could leave zero stars, I would. And when I complain they just say, ""sorry you feel that way"" DISINGENUOUS.",0
"I have been an ATT customer for 25+ years. My cousin passed away on 9/24 and I have been trying to return the iPhone that she purchased under installments in August. For almost 2 months I have spent countless hours either on hold or put in phone loops at ATT. No one knows what to do for me to send the phone back. I was told by a rep to take the phone to an ATT store and they could ship back. ATT store told me that they could not ship back and that they could not print off a shipping label. I was advised to go to a UPS store and give them her account number and they could print off a shipping label. UPS store stated that I needed to come with the label. I have tried to do the right thing with no help. I can’t even properly grieve the loss of my cousin for the hold times, the transfer times, the driving in car to stores. Your process for something like this is broken. All I need is a shipping label. Your reps have no sympathy or empathy for something like this.",0
Internet is intermittent. Cancellation requires a phone call with combative telemarketers who claim they can't hear you .,0
"This Is absolutely amazing. You would think that the higher-ups would read these reviews-umm I don’t think so. If they did, this would not continue which shows me. This is just exercise in frustration. I guess it’s just more Cathartic  Dan anything. I’ll also switch from T-Mobile to AT&T. I upgrade on my old phone 2 my new iPhone. They Quoted me a very nice but my bill does not reflect that. When I contact them on messenger, they were incredibly nice. But unfortunately, I had a very hard time accessing their chats. When I did it went to AI which is pretty much useless in this case and frustrating. So I And calling them. Even though I had my page open and my bill out on my account counter number, they still wanted my password.I told them I use a thumbprint and I have no idea. What is it anymore. They wanted me to change my pass code which I was not going to do and even though I had all the other information, they would not help me with my Bill until I couldn’t verify my password. I finally just gave up n frustration and figure  it out And we’ll figure on my own.￼ They kept saying they are here to help me with sounded really good, but in practice that was not gonna happen. I think I want to look for another company. Like I said, it’s just an exercise in frustration and I’m sure management does read this. And believe me, this is not a bot obviously",0
AT&T needs to invest more on training their human reps. The service is so below sub zero!,0
"Email these folks and pack their inbox: nicolet.macikanycz@att dot com and john.stankey@att dot comThey are the executive leaders who care little about their customers after being shown numerous screenshots of an in-home salesperson who lied and deceived and made promises on discounts which didn't even exist. Maybe if enough disgruntled people let the leaders know they will actually do something.I would never use any AT&T service ever. In my lifetime they are the worst for customer service.This is what I sent them....I signed up for internet in Knoxville, Tennessee for my son approximately three weeks ago.  While getting the internet installed, an AT&T Sr. Associate In-home Expert (Jay S***) came to sell me AT&T mobile services.  I told Jay S***, I was not interested in converting to AT&T, but he was determined.  Mr. S*** asked about my current mobile bill and said if anyone in my family was in the military or healthcare industry.  I told him my daughter was a nurse and he replied it would be a significantly better deal than what I was receiving through Verizon.  He also explained if I purchased an AARP account, I would receive an additional discount stacked on the healthcare discount. He also said AARP provides insurance for phones of up to four claims a year so there is no need for me to purchase additional insurance through AT&T.Mr. S*** promised me a rate of $127.26 plus taxes for six lines with three phones ported over and three lines with trade-ins of iphone 13 to iphone 15 with all discounts applied and three upgraded phones. I have witnesses to attest the following as well as text snapshots from his AT&T work phone to show what was promised to me.  I will attach a few of the text pictures to this e-mail.  Mr. S*** also claimed I could get the combined (wireless and internet) discount as long as my daughter and I used the same address - I explicitly asked if our names being on the accounts being different would pose an issue to which he said no (text shot attached).   NOW, here is the issue, I get a monthly bill for $330 with none of the promised discounts. In addition, he said I would receive $880 in trade-in phone credits but in reality I received $570. Also, on my bill today he applied phone insurance to my account and the option for yearly upgrades.  Which I did not ask for or approve.  It appears Mr. S*** was stacking options to help with his commissions as adding this makes no sense since he said previously the insurance wasn't needed with AARP.  As I stated, he said AARP would cover the four claims a year, but now I found today it doesn't.I was misled on numerous fronts.  I spent over four hours the Saturday after Thanksgiving on different phone calls between wireless reps, wireless managers, wireless retention reps, internet customer service and an internet customer service manager.Being so frustrated with all the blatant misrepresentations, I tried to get my original phones back and cancel AT&T.  Now I am told from AT&T phone representatives it is impossible to receive my phones back.  So, if I cancel with AT&T I have no phones to trade in elsewhere.  Obviously, this ordeal is costing me a significant amount of time and money.  Mr. S*** claims are a clear violation of customer service ethics.  I have been materially financially penalized due to Mr. S*** blatant misrepresentations of the truth.I hope to find a viable solution to the egregious behavior of an AT&T employee which led to me switching from Verizon to AT&T.  Between the loss of my mobile phones and owing $1600 for the outstanding balance to my phones and the all the time trying to rectify this situation,  I respectfully request AT&T to bundle the internet and cellular account with the 20% discount that was originally promised to me.  In addition a $2000 credit to be applied to the account for the increase in plan costs and insurance for phones from what was promised to me.  If this can be accomplished, I would commit to stay with AT&T, not post the detrimental communications sent to me by a representative of the Company and not pursue other means which would certainly be more costly to the company.Please see the attached commitments in the screen shots from Mr. S***.I appreciate your time looking into this matter and look forward to your response.",0
High prices at a high cost. Data breach after data breach. Companies tell us to protect our passwords looks like AT&T should do the same.,0
"I moved into a townhouse in March and was getting an internet service installed through AT&T we were told they were the service provider. During the service a woman name Taylor came in and later tall man came asking us change our phone service to them. They said it would make our bill 150 cheaper every month. Taylor said she would take care of everything. She said for my Verizon phone she give me 1,000 voucher to pay that off. She said we won’t worry about IPads. But what they didn’t tell me to change with them I’d have to pay extra 400 for iPad and she didn’t pay off T-Mobile phones like she said she would. I got call 10 months bill collector saying I owe T-Mobile 1600 out blue no bill was ever sent or anything. They said they would send the bill with the bill with break down to my account but they didn’t instead they put it on my credit. I try to talk Taylor when she’s not in the hospital for her child or her self from my experience when you try call her with any questions. She will just go on and on how she gave us 1000 voucher. The 1000 voucher was just suppose cover the Verizon phone. She said she cover the T-Mobile phones she did not. Her number is +1 (404) 863-6450. Be aware I can’t find her first name or her actual place of work anywhere on signed paperwork. AT&T going around ripping people off. As soon as I can get there phones paid off I’ll never do business with them again",0
"I have tried over 5 times to recover money owed to me by AT&T.   I switched to AT&T over a year ago as I was told that I would have 5G and an excellent signal.  That turned out to be FALSE!   So I called up AT&T and asked for a solution.  They said that could send me a signal booster.  It marginally fixed the issues.    However, what they did NOT tell me was this booster was considered another device on my account and charged me for over 6-8 months.  I also discovered that they had fraudulently opened up additional lines, so had a total of 5 (devices) aka lines when I should have only had ONE!!    So I called up AT&T again and here’s where things get really bad.   The customer service and they way have been treated is beyond egregious.   It took me two to three attempts to get those lines closed and credited back.    Now I have made 5 attempts to get that money returned to my checking account.    I was then told that the money was being credited back but it had to be 2 deposits due to a $500.00 limit on return credits.  I said that was fine.  Total was around $700.00.    Well guess what happened next!!   The Money did not get refunded.   I have now tried 4 more times to get that money returned.   Each time I have to explain the whole situation and each rep has to do all new investigations!!   I have now made several more attempts and have been told that I would receive calls back from supervisors on 4 occasions now and not a single person has called me back!   I am UNABLE to retrieve my money for these additional unauthorized lines and I am beyond angry.   I will be consulting with an attorney and filing a lawsuit against AT&T.    Not to mention I will be closing my account and NEVER doing business with their Mobility division ever again!!!!",0
"I was on someone else’s account, and ended up taking my two lines and transferring them onto my own account.  When this is done, they ONLY allow you to do it over the phone. After the transfer-My insurance was taken off not only my 2 devices but my girlfriend’s 2 devices on the previous line as well. Att told me I couldn’t have insurance because it has to be there from the first 30 days. This took 6- 1 to 2 hour phone calls to get straightened out.Then the next bill was extremely high at $220. I called Att and was told I would get a credit for the one month and that would bring it down to 180. The representative told me, “ your next bill and the following ones after will be 130 plus taxes and fees. This mistake was due to you being on a 1 gb plan instead of unlimited. I promise this issue will never happen again.Fast forward a month.My bill is $812I was still on the 1 gb plan and I have called over 15 times in the past month. I literally got hung up on 5 times and put on hold and they never came back 5 times.5 different times ATT tells me they are ,”creating a case” but can’t tell me the case number because it takes 3 business days to generate. So when I call back they ask for a case number and I can’t give it to them and they can’t look it up. A rep told me a few days ago my bill will be $160. Perfect. But it’s not updated on the account. And my bill is late and still showing I owe $710 . I cannot even begin to fathom how anyone can run a company with such horrible customer service. I’ve never seen anything so disorganized in my entire life.Go somewhere elseEven if it’s twice the cost I assure you that would be a great decision",0
Don’t get AT&T they are not honest about their pricing,0
They over charge and rude.  They won’t work with you.  In hopes that they will go out of business.,0
"Rep's deception to obtain account.My husband and I wanted to add Blinq cameras to an empty rental property out of state. We called AT&T and inquired about their service since we already have internet, tv and mobile services at our home. The rep tried several times to upsell throughout the lengthy sales pitch. My husband continued to tell him the ONLY thing we wanted was basic internet until a renter took over the location. The property previously had an Xfinity box outside and I mentioned we should call them and others before deciding. The rep, from another country, disregarded his singular request and aggressively continued upselling tv, etc. In the end, my husband said that he needed the internet asap and could we just go to a local AT&T to pick up the box. The rep said it would need to be shipped and we were insistent that it needed to arrive the next day or we would hold off setting up the account and look elsewhere. There had been squatters and we needed the service asap, even if we had to pay a shipping fee. The rep said it would arrive in a 1 or 2 days and I (wife) said we would decline bc we needed it for security seeing we were returning home and wanted to oversee from a distance. He continued to talk with my husband and said he could get it there in 1 day. I overheard the statement and stated he'd just said it would take 1-2 days and that if he couldn't be certain it would arrive the next day, once again we would pass. The rep placed us on brief hold, then immediately returned to the phone stating that it would be 1 day as he'd gotten ""permission"" from his supervisor. All said and done, it didn't come the next day, nor the next, as we purposely waited hoping it would arrive and then headed home disappointed. It took 4 days and we had to reroute delivery to a UPS location.Upset at the blatant delivery lie, we called back to get further info on service and the rep who misrepresented the service. The new rep, another from outside the US, said that she couldn't see who took the order. She added that was standard for delivery to take 3-4 days and apologized that he said 1-2 days as he knew that wasn't the case. I wanted to include his first name or number here so AT&T could address it specifically as this level of service besmirches their brand.There seems to be no accountability anymore and frankly people just don't care. Well, I do, and standing behind your word is everything. Again, the level of professionalism and customer service is lacking and very disappointing. I will be looking to move my service, from the rental location and my personal home soon.",0

"ATT deserves negative stars. Never ever ever pay a dime to these MF bastards. I have been a customer for more than 35 years. They DO NOT CARE. I was on the phone with them/on hold more than 5 1/2 hours on Friday and more than 6 hours on Saturday. I still do not have service. They kept transferring me to departments that were closed, hanging up, cutting me off, lying and saying they'd call back in 20 minutes. No one ever did. Every single person told me something else was wrong. They were rude, unprofessional, untrained and inhumane. THEY DO NOT LISTEN. They lied and they lied and they lied and they lied. And then they had the nerve to try to upsell when their primary service doesn't work. They hire idiots and don't train them other than teaching them not to care about their customers. I run two small businesses and they have continuously damaged my ability to connect with my customers. On top of that, their equipment and their lines are absolute garbage. ATT and the people who work there are pure filth.",0
I wish I could leave zero stars because their customer service is absolutely horrible and all they do is lie to you! I spoke with CS representatives after waiting on hold for hours (2) and then once I got a rep on the phone it was a series of being placed on hold several times while they supposedly were talking to their manager/back office staff or supposed help desk and in then end I wasted over 4 hours of my life and they were unwilling to help absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever had the experience to deal with and the service is subpar compared to my old carrier (Verizon Wireless) which I had for over a decade (30y) and I would have never switched but my bill was out of control and they were offering new subscribers a better price and loyalty means nothing to them but in hindsight I wish I never left if I knew how shitty the service was and how awful the customer service is well buyer beware STAY AWAY FROM ATT!!

"I have been trying like hell to get my number to another service. the phone they want to text to verify me is BROKEN. i have explained this SEVERAL times to them. now i've been paying for months for service i am not getting just so i can keep the phone number. my actual phone i use is with another service now (and i am MUCH happier with their level of concern for their customers). at this point after so long of no access to the number, i just want to cancel. but now they only offer tech support on a limited schedule. you better hope you are having trouble when it's convenient for them to help you! and any call takes over an hour by the time you hold for them and explain it over and over again to different people. all i want to do at this point is cancel service. they want me to make an appt for a phone call for WEDNESDAY. it's SUNDAY. seriously???? THIS is why big name monopolies get the reputation they have. it's unbelievable how low their standards are these days. i am forced by my apartment complex to have my internet with them, but I will never recommend at&t to ANYONE after all of this. in fact, i will tell this story to anyone that is looking for cell service. It's all fine and good until you need them or they screw your account up. but if you need them at all, they are ABSENT and feel no obligation whatsoever to be there for their customers. i've been trying to get this done for over a year.",0

"I would love to give negative stars. If we didn't live in a dead zone I would never speak to anyone who works at this stupid company again. My husband and I have spent over 6 hours in the stores and an additional 7 hours on the phone with AT&T and Consumer Cellular trying to get new phones and switch from Consumer to AT&T. AT&T somehow created 2 accounts with our numbers and created a crap storm that has left us in an endless loop. They have no solutions except MAYBE if we switch to a completely different service and then switch back they could do it. We need to have our new phones to supposedly fix this issue but we can't get them because the accounts are separate and they won't send the phones. Every single person we talk to can't do anything. The absolute worst customer service ever. Did I mention they charged our credit card over $1100..and ran our credit 3 times without permission. The reason I have time to write this rant...I'm sitting, YET AGAIN, in a AT&T store while my husband is on the phone with Consumer Cellular and there's no fix.

To make matters worse, they’ve failed to apply the California Teleconnect Fund (CTF) credits that were clearly included in the agreement.When we’ve tried to fix these issues, their customer service has been an absolute disaster. They give nothing but false promises and empty reassurances. Every time we contact them, we’re passed off to another representative, creating an endless cycle of frustration with no resolution in sight.AT&T’s lack of accountability and their failure to honor their contracts has been a major regret. Avoid AT&T Business at all costs—it’s simply not worth the headache or the expense.",0
"Bought a new phone and had to send my old phone in for credit.  I explained to the ""service""(joke) rep that i was in remote Alaska and it would take at least one month for my old phone to get back to them and not to charge me if it was past the due date.  They said no problem, and then added a 300 dollar charge to my account because my phone got there three days late.  No one can help me, not one rep offered any solution.  I really hate dealing with this company.",0
"Terrible Experience - Beware of Billing and Customer Service Issues.I am extremely disappointed with AT&T. We signed a contract expecting to pay $150 per month, but we’ve consistently been charged $200 or more. This isn’t just a small error—it’s blatant overcharging. On top of that, customer support has been unhelpful at every step. They promised discounts and callbacks from a manager that never happened. To make things worse, they closed the store at First Colony Mall, and now even in-store support at other locations can’t resolve our issues.AT&T’s service has been nothing but a hassle, with misleading information and broken promises. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable service or honest billing practices.",0
Worst company ever never had so many problems. They continue to have excuses about why my bill keeps rising and rising and every time I call to get answers the representatives have all kind of excuses about why your bill is so high. They lie and don't want you to speak to their supervisors. One month they are removing things from my bill the next month it's a bigger issue. I'm beside myself. If they cant fix the problem i'm going to another company.,0
Very bad customer service. Sales is mis leading,0
By far the worst carrier I've ever had I would leave them zero stars if that was an option,0
My problem has been going on since 8/22/24...today is 11/14/24.  I have wasted countless hours!  I was contacted BY AT&T and was told that I was eligible for a free phone for our business account because I was a good paying customer and they wanted to keep our business. Time #1 they sent me the wrong phone...I sent it back.  After a month again they told me I was going to get my phone...I got an ipad (which I had to send back & just now got the charges taken off of my account for).  Now I am being told they don't have a promotion for a free phone anymore.  Guess what!  I guess not because you kept screwing up my order and it made it too late for me to get my free phone.  Good luck getting someone to listen to you though.  Each agent told me they were noting my account and each agent had no clue what I was talking about.  So if AT&T calls you to give you something do yourself a favor and hang up!  Save yourself lots of time.  I am still out sales tax that was charged to my credit card from where I was supposed to get my phone.  I will still have to call to get that resolved.,0
"This is the company where you will never get the honesty , they have the worst   costumer service ever . I did huge mistake jumping out from T MOBILE to this weak connection service .so I got scammed from those representatives who they promote in Target .he said I will get 250$ per line and you can upgrade my old phone to newer which paying full amount right now ,beside that they make you easily frustrated when you just try to contact their bad costumer service. They only know one thing and that is their script. overall very disappointed  highly unrecommended:(",0
worst customer service ever can’t believe at&t got so bad on customer service .. didn’t know if i was taking with a robot or a human being how you can put someone answer like this to customer this guys he doesn’t belong to customer service really  id ks43y please help yourself found another job customer service it’s not for you,0
"Rep over the phone outright lied about sending apple watches that would be paid for with ""credits"" that did not exist. Rep stated multiple times that the cost of the watches would be immediately offset by credits and to please sign the financing for the watches in order to process the order. Rep then asked for me to pay the taxes on the watches as that was the only thing that these ""credits"" would not offset.Found out today while fixing the account issues that she created when improperly bringing on the new line (which was the only reason I had called), that there were no credits and I had been straight up scammed into financing 3x apple watches on my plan. Customer services solution was to offer multiple opportunities for me to simply PAY for the watches anyways at a slightly discounted rate. Kept implying and using language that I HAD LIKELY MISUNDERSTOOD!!! Would not listen to the recorded call and acknowledge that their rep lied. Offered to have feedback sent into their inhouse team to have the issue addressed. This is code for ""please leave your negative feedback internally so that we can hide it from the public.""**Do not trust anything a representative says to you over the phone. They lie. They then wasted HOURS of my time pushing a product that I did not even request. Later they then implied that the fault was possibly mine and that I may have misunderstood. They then gave me the wonderful offer to simply pay them for the items anyways like that was a favor. I now have to go out of my way in the middle of yet another work day to send back the items. They acted like refunding me the sales tax I was made to pay was some sort of special favor. And in the end with her deepest condolences and apologies offered to give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience. Absolutely ridiculous...",0
"The customer service is absolutely awful. It takes hours on the phone to get anywhere with an issue. When we go to our local retail store they won't unlock the door even though the sign says open and we can see a employee inside. We have two other friends that have experienced the same thing. They knocked on the door of store and they just ignored them. Lights on, open sign on, and hours on door are within open hours. Door locked won't help any of us. Its ridiculous",0
"I am extremely grateful for their prompt and efficient services, which gave me peace of mind during a difficult time. I highly recommend LEINS FELDERS for any financial or legal needs. They truly go above and beyond to ensure their clients' satisfaction.",0
Just lost a 22 year customer Verizon just saved me 2600.00 over att. Loyalty means nothing to them. Terrible service lost calls and warranty is a joke.,0
Worst experience ever !! If I could give 0 stars I would. Ridiculous hidden fees and incompetent customer service staff. If you value your time and money do not ever utilize this company !!,0
"If I could rate AT&T 0 stars I would, horrible horrible service. My PAID phone service got cut off THREE separate times for no apparent reason within the last two weeks. I spent about 2 hours in the store 2 separate times and an hour on the phone. I spoke to their “loyal” program and they want to credit my account $11. They have no problem collecting your bill money but can’t make sure your service is working. What????",0
"Spent a week without internet. Service finally fixed correctly and order placed to bury new line. When completed, I again, no longer had service.  Checked the box at the back of my house and found line that was neatly placed under the housing to be out and poorly zip tied into the box. Obvious that they disconnected and poorly attempted to fix. When reported, was told I had to be home for repair- after already taking 2 days off of work. I can't believe a company who deals in customer service is only available 8-4 Monday to Friday.  Ready to drop AT&T internet, Direct TV, and 3 cell phones over poor customer service.",0
Apparently if you buy an Apple Watch with installment plan then you also have to pay for the watch to have a phone number for your calls/texts to come through and if you try to cancel the watch phone plan (not the installment payments) then they bill you for all of your remaining installment payments at once as well.,0
"I had fiber for over a year, sales rep talked me into bundling phone for a discount and agreeing has been a huge regret. Received new phone and tried to activate on my own. When not capable called customer service and had them activate. After phones have been activated I saw a huge difference on a price than what sales rep. Talked earlier. I called customer service again and asked, Was told they couldn’t help me since a home rep sold me phones. sales rep would not talk to me, never answers the phone barely replies the text with no reliable answer even with begging and pleading for help, I visited a store, they told me the same as they could not help because they don’t know how the sales rep was able to manage to give me that price. I will call corporate office and see what solution I will be given but definitely will go out of this service even the fiber I had over a year. They may say can’t help because you trusted somebody we selected to fraud innocent people going around knocking the doors so we can make some money which we couldn’t by regular business. Nothing for the pain sweat and LITERAL TEARS of this terrible move.",0
"POS are the three best word I can describe AT fn T. I am beyond angry. I am paying $12/day for international passport but have not been able call send or receive. I can only text. This POS company could not fixed my problem after being on the line with for over 2 hours. POS, POS……..",0
I purchased a prepaid international add on plan for a week while in Italy. While the internet worked and the messaging sometimes worked I could not call out and calls from Italy could not come in. I couldn't even call AT&T from my phone. A few US calls were received. Spent two separate hours on the phone with AT&T to try to fix this from my husband's phone whose AT&T plan was working. . On second one the agent could call my phone after trying to fix it (not sure where from) but when I went to call out a few hours later once again it did not work. Called AT&T for a refund--was sent back and forth among departments and a refund was denied (after 5 contacts/attempts to contact) because there was evidence of some service usage. I could not call out for 95% of my time. THis is very poor customer service and AT&T took no responsibility for the phone function not working almost all the time. Do not get this plan.,0
"Att is the worst phone company ever they lie so much and get you to get Services through them so they can get Commission. They tell lies to get a service and when you look at your bill, it’s skyrocket it through the roof and then they don’t even wanna fix it and make excuses for the other teammates. Also Hurricane Helena knocked out a lot of their towers and the service has been no good ever since and they don’t even have any compassion about the situation and still want to charge you the same amount when they know that their services aren’t all the way back up. I would not recommend AT&T to anyone. Also I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau to follow complaint and let them know about the scamming that AT&T is doing save your money and go with a company that’s more observant of it.",0
"A long time ago, we switched our provider from Comcast to AT&T. A technician from AT&T installed a lot of wiring into our walls throughout our house and tethered a heavy device.We did not like the service, so we switched back to Comcast.A Comcast technician removed and disposed of as much AT&T debris as he could-not all of it-and restored our Comcast service.Over the years, my mom’s health declined, and she died in summer ‘24.Upon going through my late mom’s things and declutterring our house, I rediscovered the residual AT&T wiring that I cannot remove.I called AT&T and told them my story, asking for help to remove their debris. The first rep I spoke with said, “I’m sorry for your loss. We will get a technician to clean up the mess that was left by AT&T.”After holding for an hour, a 3rd rep told me that AT&T will not help me, and I need to appoint someone on my own to clear away their debris.I need AT&T to clear away the mess they created in my house years ago, so that I can move forward with my home improvement. I didn’t ask for money. I just want them to get their junk out of my way.",0
"I keep getting screw by AT&T service, being over charged, paying unrealistic fees, just bad all around, as a veteran I am suppose to get a 25% discount, but all my bill does is go up with being charged data that I am not use, I have been on hold with customer service after being transferred from collection departmentUsing Donld Trumps words! AT&T your firedCustomer service people they are stupid",0
"This company is like an ex with bad communication that will not let go.  I left them and had my number ported.  Although I followed the process and entered the code to unlock my phone that AT&T gave me, my phone remains locked.  I have not had phone service for 3 days.  I have children and a sickly mom, and no phone service.  When I contacted customer service, she kept insisting that she would text a code or call me.  I kept repeating to her that the reason I was chatting is because I cannot receive or make calls or texts.  She then proceeded to offer me deals. ""I don't want to do business with you anymore!"" I will be removing my other phones and moving them over to another provider too.  I spent about 2 hours trying to straighten things out and I still don't have phone service.  This company is horrible and their customer service reps are incompetent.",0
"AT&T prepaid is the absolute worst. Do not do it avoid it. After hours of trying to get it set up it only took 10 minutes with US Mobile but hours with AT&T the service would not work until I paid. They refused to accept my credit card, even though the bank was accepting, rather they would reverse it and then claim bank declined! 10x 2 different cards!The third-party company that is committing all of these acts for AT&T, then had the gall to try to charge me a five dollar fee to verify that I was who I am after my email had already been verified and after the bank had already approved the payment multiple times.It would appear that this is a delivery scheme to generate five dollars from each customer by making all of the credit cards fail until you call them and spend hours to get them on the line so that you can tell them which address you lived at when you were 20 years old.If I have the energy, I will file an attorney general complaint and I encourage everyone else to do the same to put this to an end. I definitely will move away from AT&T forever over this unless they personally apologize to me and solve this problem for everyone.",0
after many years of having att i feel that they are not loyal to long time customers. after i cancelled their service i was than offered a much lower option with fiber. also sending their equipment back so not to be charged 150 dollar fee is really hard. i had to call them several times before i got them to send me a fedex package to send it back. i am glad i found a local company that offered me fiber at a lower price,0
"Sales representative Jason Nicol phone number 323 499 3155 that approached me at a sales retail store (target) lied to me about getting a better price and a better internet service compared to my current internet service provider, he even highlighted to me the promotion I was getting, plus my first month will be free and and after installation I’ll get a $55 gift card but it turned out it was all a lied. After one week of having my internet installed my balance was $70. I called costumer service and in fact he works for AT&T but AT&T told me they did not have the promotion I was told about and that they were sorry for the misunderstanding. So I went ahead and canceled the service right away…..",0
"I called AT&T because I paid my internet bill, I received an email saying my payment FAILED! I checked my account balance and the funds were taken out. I called AT&T had to wait for someone to call me back. When they called me back the person could not help me (Sam). I asked to speak with a supervisor I waited for 45 minutes. Which is unacceptable and unprofessional to me. I had a HARD time understanding San and the supervisor they both was talking so fast. I had to ask both of them slow down so I can understand what they were saying. Plus they try to over talk me too.The problem I was trying to get resolved was so SIMPLE. They said I was on auto pay I said I am not because I pay my bill on phone each month. So I said AT&T owes me money so AT&T is double dipping. If AT&T is taking it out of my account and I am paying it too, Neither one of them could not understand what I was talking about. I will be calling the corporate office on Monday and I am going to change inter provider. Not a happy customer with AT&T!!",0

"WARNING !!!! STAY AWAY!!!! Literally two of the worst managers I've encountered in less than 8 days. I would not come to this location as they have a new manager named Garrett. Garrett without my consent took in my trade that I told him. I wanted to get a refund on because a previous sales person by the name of Zachery sold me new iphone and plan telling me I could combine the new number to my main phone line. This would allow me to have a new phone and not have to pay off the other phone. All I would have to do is pay the taxes on the new phone.I technically have 14 days to return my new phone and 30 days to trade in my new phone. However when I went in today trade in my phone I was told I still had to pay the balance on my old phone. I explained the situation to Garrett and all Garrett did was look down at his eyepad not once looked me in the eyes while explaining that Zachery made a misstep. I then told Garrett I would like a refund and keep my old phone and return the new one and remove the additional phone line since I was tricked into buying the new phone.Well Garrett did not tell me while he was on his iPad that instead of processing the refund and return he actually processed the trade in without my formal or signed concern. Garrett basically said he could no longer process a refund because he processed the trade in. Garrett then tossed the receipt on the table and walked away. Not only was that rude it was a fraudulent transaction since I did not consent to trading in my phone. I am surprised AT&T would allow Garrett to be a manager and conduct shady business while having a new hire and existing staff near by. Garrett lacks integrity, leadership, decision making skills. Processing my trade in without my consent and not refusing to refund me my money and give back my old phone is absolutely unacceptable since I am well in my rights to do so.This AT&T location is an Authorized Retailer not an actual AT&T store. That means that these kind of issues are dealt with at the Authorized Retailer level and corporate AT&T does not get involved. So basically you get ripped off.What basically happens is they steal your trade in of $1000 dollars and give you the street value of $350. So now if I return my new phone and cancel my new phone line they will only give me $350 for my old phone versus the $1000 dollars promotional offer I was promised. Why would I want to sell them my phone for $350? When I would have just kept my old phone and been a happy customer. Garretts lack of customer service, communication and honesty was by far the worst I've experienced at any store I've been to. I personally would never hire someone with that type of integrity.It's no wonder Zachery was let go and they have such a high turnover rate. That is two managers I've dealt with in less than a month. Now Garrett is the new manager and that's even worse than Zachery. This location will steal from you like they did from me and I would highly recommend you go to an Actual AT&T store or buy online from AT&T. These Authorized Retailers are shady and especially this location. Why would you continue to hire managers who steal and mislead their customers.The name of the company that's responsible of the location is Prime Comms - AZ. Prime Comms - AZ should really do a better job of hire their employees and especially their managers.I can't believe I've encountered two of the worst dishonest managers Zachery and now new manager Garettt who will basically with no remorse steal from you.",0

"I just spent an hour and 40 minutes at two separate AT&T locations trying to upgrade 2 phones. 60 minutes at the first location, there was a glitch in the safe where they keep phones, so that took more time. Then there was a glitch with the software he had to restart the process of upgrading, twice. During the process, he tried to sell me on screensavers and high-speed charging blocks. I told him I did not want any extras, he tossed his phone on the ground and said do you have faith that the protectors you buy on Amazon will protect your phone like this. Such a gimmick. After an hour, I finally left because there were error messages in the account and he needed the supervisor. I then went to another att, waited for 30 mins while they contacted customer service. No resolution, no new phones. I then called att to pass along my displeasure and they told me to write a letter to corporate headquarters. Such terrible service with no solution.",0
"Horrible company. If you accidentally call internationally (other than US, Canada, Mexico), it is $3/min! No one will tell you this, until you have accumulated hundreds of dollars of charges. So, you need to add ""international call blocking"" to your cell account. But that will not stop you from being charged ""international data roaming""! You have to block that too! It is so confusing, when you call, even their own reps don't know about all these. How are you, ATT, expect an average customer to know? I guess that's how they charge hundred of dollars from their customers. Completely unethical practice!!!If you think you are well protected from adding the above two block, you are wrong! You have to call them to add ""international text blocking"", otherwise you will still be charged! My gosh, how crazy it that? The greed and dishonesty of this company is beyond description!Finally, if you log into your ATT account, you can add ""add on"" to your account. But the above are not shown, so you cannot add them on yourself. Worse yet, you don't even know they exist. You are welcome now that you know.",0

"I have been on the phone with AT&T For 3 hours. No one knows what they are doing...It is appalling that I can't get service to my New home. 3 customer service Reps and a supervisor and still no satisfaction. All I want is internet. Check this out,   I (not them) had to Contact the present owners who I've never met to get them to submit a date of cancelation before I can get service. Even though the have all the information in their system WOW! When I got back to them My entire order was canceled. They kept asking for a electric bill or water bill to prove I live there but I haven't  moved in yet. In one week I will move in and just wanted internet on when I arrive. My Electric, water and garbage will all be turned on on that date with no problem and in 15 minutes of contacting them But,  for some reason AT&T has made it so difficult I had to hang up. I am a very patient man but this is the worst operation I have ever seen.  If it's this difficult to get service on I can't imagine what it would be like to cancel.I expect AT&T corporate to contact me but I have little faith this will happen",0
"The record-keeping is so screwed up, and when you call, they can not find your account or your phone or your pin. The problem is primarily when you want to cancel, not when you buy their phone or internet. Simply you can not cancel even if the equipment does not work within the 30-day grace period. If you do, they mess up your credit.  This is terrible. I hope nobody has to go through this.",0
I have six accounts with at&t.The county changed the addresses on our road about 7 years ago every time I call to give them the proper address they tell me they have no service at the new address. Keep in mind i already have service at the physical location already. They tell me if I change the address I CANT get service so I cant give them the proper address that would be a problem with a 911 call going to an address that no longer exists.please someone with common sense help with this matter.,0

I have had three Galaxy s22 on my account for well over 2 years. I elected to get the extended warranty when I bought them. Never had a claim. Recently the battery on one of them started failing. I called AT&t and they sent me to their agent asurion. That was 10 days ago. Nightmare ever since. First they wanted to send me over 60 miles away to a tech center. I live in metropolitan Orlando. I refused and asked AT&t to intercede. They did and asurion agreed to send a tech to my home to replace the battery. Never showed up. I called again. Asurion said the appointment was canceled because they didn't have the part. Said they would probably be getting new batteries and I should sign in and check every day to see if a battery is in. I said why don't you call me when you get it. They said it doesn't work that way. There is much more craziness to this story but I won't bore you with the details. AT&t needs to do a better job of picking their agents,0
"Extremely Disappointed with AT&T’s Customer Service and Unfulfilled PromisesI’ve been a loyal AT&T customer for over three years, and this is the first time I’ve had to contact customer service. Sadly, this experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing, and I feel compelled to share it here.Despite being a long-term customer, I received poor service from AT&T’s support team. My issue was not addressed properly, and the promises made by the agents to resolve my concerns were not kept. I was left feeling completely disregarded and unimportant to the company.I expected much more from a company I’ve trusted for so long. Instead of the courteous, helpful service I should have received, I felt like I was treated as if I didn’t matter at all. I’m deeply disappointed by how my situation was handled and by the complete lack of professionalism and empathy shown by the customer service agents.It’s hard to believe that a company that I’ve been loyal to for years would treat me this way, and now I’m reconsidering my relationship with AT&T moving forward. I sincerely hope that AT&T will take this feedback seriously and make improvements to its customer service. Long-time customers like myself deserve better treatment than what I experienced.#DisappointedCustomer #AT&T #CustomerServiceFail #UnresolvedIssues",0

AT&T is a joke. All they are interested in is making a sale. They were supposed to pot a number. Three different agents canceled the other agent deal to redo it for themselves. Got all my personal info social security number drivers license number although I ordered no equipment. I had my own phone. I wanted a landline and was told they didn’t have landlines and cellular service would better. I had been transferred different departments any given different numbers to call. Most of the representatives didn’t understand English and repeat the same thing. I requested a supervisor and I was told they were sitting next to them assisting with the call twice. The last time I called I insisted on speaking with a supervisor and was on hold just to speak with another agent. They are bad business. I love Verizon best customer service and if they could port the number I NEVER would have called AT&T for ANYTHING!! FYI the number requested was a Bell South landline. Company was bought out by AT&T. I called to cancel and the agent was rude just hung up after I asked if all my information is removed out of their system.,0

"Our family had AT&T Wireless services, originally with five (5) lines, for almost thirty (30) years.  In September, AT&T applied an additional $20 per month charge for 5G services; which we did not have.  So, I advised AT&T we would be canceling our service with them.  Accordingly, last month, all AT&T Wireless services were cancelled.  Today, an AT&T bill arrived for the next month's service.  After 42 minutes on a phone call to AT&T Customer Care, and previously being told we would only be billed for a day or two of service, AT&T refused to reverse the next month's charges.  AT&T Customer Care said the cancellation was one day into a new billing cycle, and they have a ""No prorated service policy.""  $153.68 for one day of service.  WHAT A TOTAL RIP OFF!",0
"I started my AT&T service in 2018. At the time it seem like AT&T was doing OK. They bought DIRECTV not too long ago and it seemed like my service was pretty good.My first impression I feel like AT&T has gone downhill pretty significantly not only did my stock go down substantially, but the company is really letting me down, especially within the last year. They made it out like 5G was going to be the next best thing and service would be amazing. I have to say the service is amazing and even when I have 3 to 4 bars of service on multiple occasions, my phone has me down and told me I have connection. I would understand if this were happening at a sporting event or something like that however, I have been around for 30 minutes trying to post this because of the service being so bad and I’m in Concord, North Carolina not even like the big city  right now I have 3 bars of 5G+ and I have literally no connection I had to connect to McDonald’s WiFi to post this.

"I have great respect for dedicated retail consultants, especially those I know working for AT&T/prime communications. However, after being lied to by customer service regarding her employment with the company and receiving no response following an apathetic apology from the Office of the President, despite submitting evidence of what I endured at the hands of one of their employees, I will never return as a customer.This employee’s harassment was severe. Her actions led to a severe sprain in my foot and ankle, resulting in lost wages since I couldn’t work for the rest of the season. She intentionally triggered flashbacks by slamming doors and confronting me at my door, putting me in fear for my life and my children’s safety. She even went so far as to make a false report with Child Protective Services.I eventually had to move because of her, yet she lied to the courts, stating that I was the reason for the delay in my relocation. When the actual reason was due to scheduling conflicts with inspections by the borough. She even conducted a background check on me—not for any service-related purpose, but to reach out to my ex and support him in court. She manipulated the judges, fully aware of my severe anxiety and status as a disabled veteran with a high mental health rating. She labeled me as “bipolar” to further discredit me, though I live with Borderline Personality Disorder, a deeply painful mental illness. I don’t just “switch off”; I hold onto these impacts for weeks, months, even years.If AT&T wants to recover their money, they’re pursuing the wrong person. I’ve endured more than enough, and this experience has made it clear I deserve far better.If there is any confusion, she was my neighbor. While this platform makes you out in a date, this had been going on since November of 2023.",0
This is the worst cellphone company I have ever had. They are so expensive and lie constantly.,0
Do not sign up for ATT. At least not in the Jersey Shore area. Goes off line so much I had to buy a cheap phone from Verizon to use when ATT is off line. I've asked hundreds of people in the problem areas and all have same issue. Even people with the most expensive phones. Must be tower problems. And they won't let you out of the contract. Super frustrating!! Reviews asks for date of bad experience but it's every single day. Even if I dont go out.,0
"Starting in April 2024, AT&T has repeatedly removed my account from Auto-pay, and I lose my auto pay discount. also end up paying late because I didn't know they'd removed my auto-pay. I've had to call in each month to have this ""fixed"". It is now November 2024 and this ""glitch"" has been ongoing. Every time I sign back up to autopay for the discount I get an email right before its due to kick in that I've made changes to my account, stating that I've removed my account from autopay. Except I made no changes to my account. Strongly recommend going with another company",0
"Had a plan for $60 a month with no price increase if I went paperless. I pay my bill on-line. Went on-line to pay this month and my bill jumped to $65 with no explanation. When I finally got a hold of a representative, she said I could get my original price if I gave my bank account information or a credit card number. I told her they were breaking their agreement. She said once I start paying the $65, my rate won’t go up…until they want to do this again! Oh, and they did this during a hurricane! I haven’t had service since 9/26/24!Take a snap shot of their offers for verification or get a contract! I’m not sure if either of those will help, but just know they're not sticking to their offers!",0
"Just want to alert everyone that the AT&T/Costco promotion is totally misrepresented. Clearly the AT&T reps (all young) at Costco, desperate to sign on new subscribers, are either 1) not fully informed of and do not understand a package they are selling or 2) could just be very selective in sharing information upfront that would have been a nonstarter for consumers like me. 18 months after signing what I though was a great deal, I I am now stuck in a contract for 3 years which I have to no choice to take to term before I own the  Iphones which, BTW, were marketed as being free upgrades. I actually gave a up an existing AT&T family contract where my phones, now paid off, were returned to AT&T as part of this deal. Numerous calls to various levels of AT&T reps resulted in more frustration and left me with a terrible impression. Prior to signing the ""back hole"" agreement, I had already been with AT&T for 20 years.",0
"AT&T air internet is the worst Internet I have ever had. It is intermittent all day everyday. I stream everything, so imagine trying to watch a movie when your internet keeps turning off and on all day long. They have sent their people out here many times to repair to no avail. I am truly done with you guys. I just cancelled my direct tv which is owned by AT&T and I will be cancelling my internet and mobile phone plans as well.  Bye forever AT&T!",0
If I could give them a 0 I would! We have internet with them and now 2 months in a row they cut off my services AFTER I paid my bill! Now they are trying to tell me that they will not cut.my service back on unlessi pay the bill that's not even due yet! We called after they cut.our services off and they assured us that it was their mistake and the services would be cut back on. We'll they were never turned back on. So we called back and now we are being told they they are having a SYSTEM GLITCH and want us to pay a bill that's not even Dye yet to turn my service back on! This is.the 2nd time they have done this! We will be finding a new service and I will NEVER use ANYRHING AT&T again!,0
"I just switched to another phone company. AT&T's internet service was slow, it always disconnected, and I was always running out of data and being overcharged for my phone/internet bill.",0
"I'm complaining about the AT&T office in Columbia MS by the Dollar Tree!! My husband and I went to have his phone unlocked so he could use another SIM card in the phone. My husband has already talked to AT&T on the phone and they told him to go the office and they could help my husband.When we walked into this office the man at the first desk looked at us all confused and didn't know what he was doing. Then when the employee asked the other employee if the wanted to do paperwork the reply ""No I'm eating Cake"" and both employees were watching tv on the big TV. There were super rude!! Terrible Customer service!!",0
"I spoke with William about getting a new phone and I wasn't eligible for an upgrade and then he said, if I opened up a third line, I would be paying the same price as I am for 2 lines so I did, and he told me that if I buy a phone off eBay an S7 Edge, I could get a Samsung. S24 ultra for free and he even helped me find it on eBay. I've been trying to get ahold of the back office, but they still won't get back with me all of the customer services doing is give me a run around. I did talk to the loyal department and all they are doing. Is giving me a run around too? They even took $436 out of my account for no reason. And they wouldn't even refund it. If anyone is trying to get a phone from AT&T for business, I would not recommend it customer service sucks.",0
THE ABSOLUTE WORST! Increased my bill without me agreeing to any upgrades! Spoke to a customer service person that was clueless! Kept going around in circles! Wasted over an hour of on the phone!! HORRIBLE!!,0
"My voicemail box is locked and I've been on hold waiting for an agent for 30 minutes now. I run a business and cannot wait this long to speak with an agent! There is no reason that a company like AT&T cannot provide technical assistance in a reasonable time, but they choose to make their customers angry. Must be nice to be almost a monopoly!",0
"Let's start by saying if you live in Altoona,PA, and go to the At&t store on Pleasant Valley Blvd beware. In April I went in to upgrade my watch, Nathan talked me into getting another watch and upgrading my phone cause it wouldn't be much more money because the watches were buy one get one free and I would get a thousand dollars for my phone if I would trade it in. Needless to say I got 2 new watches and a new phone but remember I should be getting all these discounts and rebates. 6 mos later I get a text saying I canceled one of my lines for one of the watches. I call customer service only to be told that it was my problem to fix what the at&t store messed up. Nathan canceled my original number that my watch was tied to and gave me new numbers on both watch lines. I didn't know this happened but since he canceled my original line for my watch I have not gotten the watch for bogo or 27 something a month accredited to my account for the phone trade in. Originally I was told it would take a while for me to see the discounts so I didn't think anything of it. The first customer service person I talked to which by the way was a manager stated that I had to reinstate my original line to get the discounts and if I didn't reinstate the line I would not receive any money back, that guy ended up hanging up on me cause I said that he needed to explain to me why this became my problem to fix when someone there messed up and why i needed to reactivate a line that wont have a watch tied to it, i simply said that i didn't need another watch. So an hr later my husband called and spoke with someone that knew what he was doing and fixed everything, my husband was on the phone for an hr and a half but fingers crossed everything is taken care of.",0
"AT&T has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Every issue requires not just one, but four to five calls—sometimes even more—just to have a chance at getting it resolved. Each time I call, I’m met with a new answer or conflicting information, making it impossible to feel confident that anyone truly knows how to help. It’s incredibly frustrating and time-consuming. If you’re considering a mobile carrier, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. AT&T used to be known for quality and reliability, but it’s clear that those values have taken a back seat. I’m genuinely disappointed in what this company’s customer service has become.",0
we just switched to At&t  at costco coming from T-mobile the customer service are the horrible we was on the for many hours and days just to exchange  s 24 Plug with abs issue . they still put us on hold for hourswe will look for a diffrence company as soon as possible.,0
"Service was spotty most of the time regardless where any of us on the family plan were. The worst part was leaving. I have been leasing phones for many years with different companies but was never told that my monthly payments was actually a payment plan to purchase the phones instead of leasing them and returning them when I left the company. Now I’m stuck with paying the remaining balance, phones that are glitchy and new phones from the new phone company.",0
"I've been with ATT my entire life.  Their service has been spotty but I've stayed with them bc I thought they were better than others.  Recently, they've been installing fiber optic cables in my neighborhood and have cut my lines repeatedly.  No sooner do they get me fixed than I'm cut AGAIN.  I have to go through their nightmare of what they call ""customer service"" to get my wifi back.  Then, as if that isn't bad enough when I'm on the phone with my ""customer service"" repeatedly i hear a party in the background.  Everyone is laughing, joking, and having a blast...of course, NOT their customer.  I have to stay in for the third time in two weeks, instead of taking care of my business, to be available for their ""technician.""  It's time to dump ATT and find a company that's reliable so that I can have a party of my own .",0
Leaving AT&T they locked my wife's sims card and will not unlock it. New company cannot change. I was on the phone for 4 hours with AT&T couple nights ago no help at all!! I'm at a store and there is nothing they can do. Tried website they gave me but no good says call you new provider. They can't unlock something AT&T did.AT&T is *#%+!!!!,0
Company offers 3 promotions for signing up and has been refusing to give 2 out of 3 of them. I’ve spent over 1.5 hours on the phone with everyone making excuses of why the issue can’t be fixed. Classic bait to get you to sign up and then zero aftercare because you’re stuck in a long term contract.,0
"AT & T is a nightmare. It’s a catch 22 abyss with no resolution and the customer service when you try to resolve issues by calling 611, is hostile, inefficient and uncaring.  Trying to upgrade one of our cell lines. There is a glitch on the account that was placed there months ago . It happened when I attempted to upgrade by phone. Got a person in a foreign country. Almost through with upgrading. Call dropped. Called back . Call dropped again. Went to AT& T kiosk. They couldn’t resolve the issue. They told us to go Corporate store. We did that and they upgraded my phone . But after an hour the same thing happened as at the kiosk. They said there’s a block or note preventing you from upgrading the other line. We can’t help you. You will have to call 611. Total nightmare!",0
AT&T mobile customer is the worst in the world. They outsourced to India. Their customer service doesn’t know and do anything. Complete incompetence and useless. Still tie up with phone payments. If not I a switching to Verizon Wireless. Verizon customer service is world class. ATT provide garbage customer customers.,0
"I moved cell service from AT&T including my watch.  I went to the store to ensure it was done correctly.  I had to go back again because they didn't get it done right.  Once assured all lines, including my watch, were canceled with them (ported out to  T-Mobile) I thought issues were fixed.  9 months later my wife noticed we were still paying $60 a month for the watch.  45 minutes on the phone to the Phillipines and 2 agents later I was told it was my fault for not double checking on the watch.  I told him I did.  They wouldn't return my money for services I never received.",0
"The only reason I’m giving them one star is because I can’t give them zero stars but they suck. They told us to switch to voice data and network from our landline at work because we would have to pay a $500 phone bill versus $80 phone bill and then, we just switch to 5G and I just did the Speedtest and it’s running slower than my phone at like 19 MB per second worst service worst company ever trying to run a restaurant business and not play games I lost thousands of dollars the first day. The new phones came in because they gave the cell phones That weren’t working or half day nobody could call and make any anyways worst experience ever wouldn’t recommend it to anyone on face of planet",0
"I dropped 2 business lines in July. In Oct they finally resolved the problem and the lines were dropped form the account! I then attempted to simply move a line to a personal account ( AARP discount) they moved it to a ""business account""---the foreign rep then moved it back to the original account--each time adding fees!",0
"It should be illegal for them to be throttling their website so much. I could write a better website that loads faster in my sleep.The fact that it takes minutes to load any page, and minutes to load anything inside of the page, means they are doing it on purpose to get people to ignore their plan and simply set up auto pay and drain money from their account.I just swapped phones recently, and have paid my final bill for them. The payment was not too horrible, the customer service over the phone was not too horrible, but the website alone and the app too, oh my god.They are preying on people to give up dealing with their shitty ass website and simply set up auto pay and not leave them. It is actually sad and it should actually be illegal.It does not matter if their web dev team is that bad, at this point its pure negligence and intentional disrespect and illegal predatory misconduct for people that do not understand the internet. Redo the entire website and I will delete my review.",0
"Worst service ever,",0
"As a new business owner, dealing with AT&T has been one of the most frustrating experiences. I've spent hours on the phone trying to resolve overcharges of hundreds of dollars, only to find out they have no record of any previous calls. Reps promise things and never follow up - can’t view my bills in the app, and I haven’t received any paper bills or letters. Then, they suspended my service, wouldn't let me access customer service reps to discuss details of the bill unless I paid a 'convenience fee.' Absolutely unacceptable for any business, especially a new one trying to get started - go to Verizon - wayyyy better!!!!",0
"I’ve been a loyal AT&T customer, but recent experiences with customer service have been disappointing. After four calls in 48 hours, my issue remains unresolved due to outsourced support teams that struggle with language barriers and lack familiarity with my concerns. Cutting costs shouldn’t come at the expense of effective communication and customer satisfaction. I’m now considering other providers who prioritize clear, efficient support.",0
"I've been with ATT for 20 years and they think nothing of loyalty and will not work with you on your payments. I have one line and pay over $100 every month. Service is lacking, signal sucks everywhere and I think I stayed with them over a bad habit than anything. Do not give these people one penny of your hard earned money. There are too many other companies that offer better service and plans. As soon as I get this phone paid off I'm out!",0
"If I could give a -1 rating to AT&T Store 4405 West Wendover Avenue in Greensboro,NC 27407, I would. Beyond terrible. Rude. Not willing to assist. Yanibel was the representative. I will make it my mission to spread the word to anyone I can to not go with AT&T or to leave AT&T.",0
"Worst insurance ever!!!!After having my Samsung galaxy flip4 having shut off when closed, I started a claim with ATT-Asurion they sent me a replacement cell, arrived and looked good I started the long and painful process of moving stuff over about halfway I restarted the phone and after opening and closing the phone the screen bubbled and cracked. I called and started the process of getting another replacement (they kindly said they were waiving the deductible; I was like I would hope so....) then the 2nd replacement arrived. that looked good and after opening and closing it a few times and the screen didn't crack I decided to go ahead and start to move stuff over, at this point I had stuff on the other two phones, important stuff like MS Authenticator and DUO. about 80% of the setup the new, new replacement said out of storage. they sent me a 128GB version instead of the 256GB one that the other cells were. and they won't ship another correct until I return the previous cells, now mind you that I have some of the MS Authenticator and Duo on both phones because after the screen cracked, I stopped so now I have it spread over the cells with issues, and they won't ship a 3rd so that I can set up all the Authenticators... Horrible Horrible, Horrible!!!!",0
AT&T took $1845.15 from my account via automatic pay for a bill their customer service agent in the Philippines told me on a RECORDED line that the charges had been FORGIVEN. I have had a small business relationship with them for over 10 years that is decimated today by this action.,0
"WORST COMPANY EVER...BUYER BEWARE!!!! AT&T got HACKED and my IMEI number was stolen on a phone I was in possession of, bought from ATT and they EVEN showed the DATE I purchased it from THEM, I went to the AT&T store, and showed them I still have the phone and my ID, they said: ""Oh we see where you purchased the phone from us."" I WAS a customer of theirs since 2017.  However, they did nothing to help me get my phone working, I spent 5 DAYS having to take time off work, calling customer service, and going to the store, I spent over $900.00 on this phone FROM THEM, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! I was told ""Sorry you will have to purchase another phone, on the 5th day of missed work because of THEM"" Gee how convenient for THEM! THEY DID NOTHING NO CREDIT, NO let's see what we can do for you since you have been a customer for 7 1/2 YEARS. NOTHING.  No thank you, I switched to MINT MOBILE which is WONDERFUL, Everyone should Switch from TRASH AT&T to MINT MOBILE! SERIOUSLY!",0
"Over expensive and unreliable service. Their stores only help if you are looking for a plan, once you are in, you are on your own. Very inefficient call center.",0
Their sales representing stole my phones and never gave me credit. F CK ATT. F cking crooks,0
They double charged me And wouldn't give me any money back and was rude about it would only pay my income bill which hadn't been though of. Then a week later my Internet stops all the same I call for support and they advised me they didn't have enough customers where I live. Btw it less than a mile from the att tower so they can rock on,0
The service on a brand new iPhone works the same with 4 bars as it does with 1 aka it doesn’t work plus the terrible iPhone 15 pro max which is supposed to be amazing can barley do shi with even WiFi it 2024 I would like to open google and make a call on my phone but ig that’s too much to ask,0
"If ONLY I could choose NEGATIVE 5 stars!! This company is a HUGE waste of my time! I cannot believe how many times I have canceled our service and continued to be charged! When I try to call I am put on hold for 30 min at a time! When I schedule a call they call me back, tell me they are unable to help me and put me back on another 30 min hold!! We will NEVER recommend this company to anyone! They are awful!",0

"Terrible experience switching from Xfinity to AT&T. I was at the branch for hours upon hours. They told me my old number was ported when in fact it was not. I traded in my old phone with them, got a new apple watch, with a three year contract based on the premise that I would be able to keep my business number. I specifically asked the employee at the store about keeping my numbers and their importance and I was assured that it would not be a problem. My business number seemed to work for about a half a day. When I was finally able to get on the phone with the porting department to trouble shoot they said the number was NOT ported and I would have to go back to Xfinity and talk with them. Finally got through to the porting department at Xfinity and they said the line was deactivated and there was nothing they could do. So here I am weeks later with no functioning line that im still being charged for by the way. I didn't even get a receipt or email of the service I was getting when I left the AT&T store. I have no way to log in to my new account to see what is happening as none of the log in features are working. I have wasted so many hours of my time using AT&T chat feature, multiple trips to the store, on hold and being transferred from department to department I feel Like I should be sending THEM a bill for my time!",0
AT&T is absolute trash! Mobile service f**king suck and the company should be required to cease requiring payment from any user. You are taking money for a service you are not providing. There is never a reason I should be in my house and not be able to talk on my phone because the other person can’t hear me/I’m going in and out. It is inexcusable for me to have to walk around my house to try and place an outgoing call! Just this morning I attempted to call AT&T over 25 times before my call would actually go through. And they always give the scam excuse of “we’re aware of some interruptions due to us improving our service.” No you’re not! You’re not trying to improve crap - all the company is doing is placing more customers on a network they don’t even have the bandwidth to provide decent service to their already customers.,0
Bought iphone 15 online to be picked up in store attt charged me for it then they cancel the order saying they cant verify it came from me even though i would have to show my identification when i pick it up in store. Now they still haven’t given my money back or a phone,0
"Sandra Carr, from the ""Office of the President"" is a professional con artist.  She raised my wireless price from $50 per month to $78 per month because I filed a complaint against her and AT&T with the Better Business Bureau for scamming with intentional infliction of emotional distress and because I am a senior citizen over 70 years of age and is discriminating against me because of my age and my complaints.",0
"I was at an AT&T corporate store and the associate told me if i switched to AT&T Internet Air my bill would be $35/Month. I accepted this offer as it was better than my current internet bill. I received the router, hooked it up and was happy with the service. Then i got my first bill... $60.00 was taken out of my account. I called customer service thinking it must be a mistake. They claimed that the deal the associate offered me had expired 2 days before i signed up. I told them that seems like an AT&T issue and that its AT&T's responsibility to make sure its employees are offering the right deal. AT&T refused to make it right. They effectively stole money out of my bank account and refuse to make it right. I will be canceling my Phone and internet service and i will no longer do business with AT&T. I would highly suggest avoiding this service carrier.",0
"As of today, 10-19-2024, I had another disappointing experience at the AT&T store located at 2510 S Telegraph Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48302, involving the manager, Jon. I traded in my iPhone 13 as part of the $700 off promotion on the iPhone 16. After setting up my new phone, I asked Jon to show me the promotion details on AT&T's website, citing a past issue where I didn't receive my full credit for three phones at this location. The manager, Forrest Hughes, handled the two phones in 2022. Jon refused to assist me, stating it wasn't his job, and became very dismissive. When I handed him my phone to help find the information, he attempted to navigate the AT&T website for about a minute but couldn't locate the details. At this point, he threw my phone on the table and rudely told me that my previous bad experiences were due to ""bad people"" who didn't represent AT&T.Fortunately, another employee, Aayan, stepped in and found the trade-in information within one minute. Aayan was polite and professional throughout the interaction, which starkly contrasted with Jon's rude behavior.",0
"I just spent about half an hour waiting to get waited on at a local AT&t branch on Holly avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The employee, the one single employee there was shooting the s*** with one of his friends and their son about cars. Everything they loved about cars for 30 minutes. When I left when I finally left, the one employee asked if he could help me for the first time in those 30 minutes. I told him no. If you're going to shoot the s*** with your friends instead of helping a customer, maybe I'm with the wrong company. This is not acceptable.",0
"They baited and switched me by assigning me to a plan I didn’t agree to.  Then, they don’t send out the first bill for more than 3 weeks.  This accomplishes an important task for them.  Every customer has 14 days to cancel their service.  I didn’t know what I was actually being billed for until 23 days into my service.  At that point, they would not acknowledge their mistake, or adjust any charges.  I cancelled my plan, but was still on the hook for the second month because they bill for 2 months in advance.  Even though I’m no longer a customer, I still owe them for month #2 because that’s what I “agreed to”.  Yes, I did agree, but to a completely different plan!  Run away as fast as you can.  They are liars and thieves.",0
I don’t understand why they make it impossible to pay my bill !! I’ve tried for four days to make a payment and because I have a new debit card number it’s impossible to make a payment !! I guess it’s time to find a new phone company. Terrible customer service !!,0
"I've been with the company for 5 plus years and the decided to cut my phone off $4 and refuse to cut it back on, until I pay my next month bill. I'm done with them and will be taking my business elsewhere.....",0
"The customer service rep at Walmart, her name was kristina on sigmon road here in Wilmington, did a lot of talking, and not much of it was true at all. I went through hell for a week returning the phone getting the invalid expired contract null and void, which you would think it already would be since it had expired two days prior to when I signed it. But she took my phone and did all sorts of accounts without my knowledge, and literally turned my life upside down for a week. Do not under any circumstances go with AT&t if you value your money, your hard work, your time etc.. it is not worth it, go with another phone carrier!Date of experience: October",0
Signed up for service and was promised a couple rewards cards valued at $150. Didn't receive them. They don't use a system that tracks deliveries. Told me I had to file theft charges with the police. Shouldn't they have to do that since the items never came into my possession?,0
ATT deserves no stars!!! They prey on the elderly coming into their homes talking them into cutting their land lines and going to a cell phone. Which they already have!!!! But they convinced them they are saving money 😳 Now it going to cost 1000.00 to get out of this mess!!! Horrible heartless phone service people!!! 🤬,0
They are very misleading and will cut your Internet off before the due date,0
Please do not get anything from AT&T I wanted to get some internet and decided to cancel the order before my appointment I call customer service and they fail me with everything about cancellation and my refund for my 100 deposit every representative I talk with gave me the run around they gave me a 1800 number that was no longer in service they also kept going around the fact i wanted my refund they was so quick to take my deposit but didn’t give it back they kept having me on hold and hanging up I call for like a week in a half trying to take care of this matter same thing from different representative no one didn’t help me or tried to resolve this matter customers service sucks they take your money and hold it and try to force you to get everything with them they even ask me what kind of phone I was on like they wanted to block me from calling back about my money and til this day I didn’t receive my money back from them I had to report it fraud to my bank stay away from AT&T,0
Absolutely the worst possible customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. All I was trying to do was order a new iPhone lol and it seemed imposible.,0
Has gone to crap the last 3 years.  About to drop them after 20 years.,0
"I am absolutely appalled by the service I received from AT&T, specifically from a representative named Vanardo. My family and I have been loyal customers for over 20 years, with six premium phone lines, and we expected better than this blatant deception.During our call, Vanardo assured us that we were eligible for completely free upgrades on all our phones. He explicitly stated that our monthly bill included a fee for ""Anytime Upgrades"" and that we had accrued extra credit, making our trades entirely free. Fast forward to now, and I’m trying to ship back our old phones only to discover that there is no shipping label as promised.When I logged into our AT&T account, I was shocked to find that we are being charged full price for the new phones—$38 a month for each of the six phones over 36 months! This is nothing short of a scam. Vanardo's statements were clear, and I demand that AT&T review the recorded call, where all of this misinformation is documented.I spoke with a supervisor (MYLENE) who offered no real help. She claimed she couldn’t access the call transcript but assured me that once they do, the evidence of Vanardo’s promises will be undeniable. It’s infuriating to know that the company I’ve trusted for two decades is engaging in such deceptive practices.AT&T needs to take responsibility for this situation. I expect a full review of this case, a reversal of these charges, and a proper resolution. This is unacceptable, and I will not stand for being misled by your representatives. If AT&T does not take liability for this situation, I will be forced to take my business elsewhere after 20 years.",0
"I went on a cruise. Prior to departure, I purchased att's ""International Day Pass""..., only to find out that this did not cover the period when the ship was actually sailing..., only applied to when the ship was docked at a port. When att informed me of this, I called att customer service to discuss the matter and selected the ""call back"" option in their call menu. So att called me back on what I thought was a toll free number ""+1 (855) 419-7365"" only to be charged $3/min Int'l roaming charge for a total of $84. After the cruise, I called att customer service to remove the charge, but they refused insisting that it was not an att number because att customer service is located in the Philippine islands. The worst part is that the very phone number that they called me back on was again... you guessed it ""+1 (855) 419-7365. Incredible !!!",0
So so bad.   I left ATT 30 yrs ago because they were so awful.    Their automated  AI endless virtual customer service loop is useless.   Trying to reinstall voicemail.   Awful.,0
"Like everyone else, ATT lied to me.  I as due a refund, confirmed by AT&T in writing.  I waited & waited for the refund check that never came, so I called ATT.  They changed their story, I was on the phone for 1 hour & 15 minutes.  I gave up. & hung up.  T Mobile is great!",0
The company offices an unlimited cell services so I had this issue with Metro PCS and they corrected it because I would run out of data for my time was up on my monthly plan I said with your offering unlimited why they need to upgrade my planning from running out of data and they changed it well I'm with AT&T now and I have unlimited but after I pay my bill two weeks into the plan they send me a text and says I'm almost capped at my data but if it's Unlimited I should be capped at all so I have to go make an additional payment to free up more data why do I have to feel more data if it's Unlimited when you try to call them it's hard to get through to them they're trying to capture your line and send you through all these queries and options so you can't even talk to representative they're misleading the public some misrepresentation and I call it fraud and file a complaint with the FCC and the internal General because unlimited it means there's no ceiling on the amount of data you can use but AT&T is manipulating as consumers and this has to stop,0
I would’ve put 0 stars …When opening account representative gave a different amount but when bill came was double amount. Don’t listen to “the special discounts “ it’s a scam . Customer service not helpful.,0
"If I could leave no stars, I would. Worst company overall. So not use AT&T. Stay away. You will be happier for it. They don’t want to be helpful and continue to scam me… I will leave every bad review.",0
"AT&T is the absolute WORST!!! My father in law passed away right after Christmas time in 2023. Unfortunately, right before his passing his cellphone was stolen. We have since been going through probate which has been smooth except for AT&T. Do not ever buy anything from them. First off, they require you to have a PIN. If you do not have this PIN, you cannot gain access to any information. When we first tried to contact AT&T regarding my father in law's passing, we were asked for a PIN. Well, I know this is hard to understand but my father in law is dead and cannot give us his PIN. We guessed every amount of relevant numbers we could thing of and none of them worked. Mind you, we had his social security number, his date of birth, his cremated remains, his mother's death certificate; anything and everything you'd need to resolve these accounts. Instead we were told over and over again that they would send a link to reset his PIN to his stolen phone. It was like a Saturday Night Live sketch where we tried to explain that we didn't have the phone. After almost a year of dealing with them, they have now told us that we need to go into the corporate office to get a letter so that we can give it to our lawyer saying there is no financial responsibility but was told by the staff at the corporate office that without the PIN there is no way to see if there is financial responsibility. So even if we had a check for all the money needed to pay down the account, without the PIN number we would not be able to pay on the account. On another note, one of the employees that works for the corporate office told us that he had the EXACT SAME issue and it took 2 YEARS to resolve!! How is this still an issue with this company?? NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AT&T!!",0
"This is the absolute worst phone company I have ever tried. Lied to me about what my monthly charge would be.I ended up paying 341.00 a month for two phones and a tablet, After being told , it was gonna be about 206. Service was Not great and there was a lot of hidden fees Like The one they Charged Me on my first bill for a hundred and fifty dollars stating it was extra time on my phone plan since I started my plan Before a monthly cycle I would not recommend this company to my enemy",0
"The Internet in my home and the surrounding area has been out for the better part of a week and AT&T either refuses to give me an ETA on when service will be restored or straight lacks the ability to do so. Not knowing on the first day, I'd understand. But a daily text that can be summarized as ""We're really working on fixing it, we promise"" doesn't cut it.",0
The WORST customer service. The obviously out source all there work to low paying countries who barely speak English. Told me they would call me back in a week to help me move my internet to my new home and never heard back from them.,0
"I called ATT help desk. I should’ve have 16 GB 300 dollars payment for a year. They said that I have 8 G 300 dollars. When I did it, I choice 16G not 8. It was their fault to put me on 8G. If you check their website, they have 16G 300 dollars, they didn’t help me to change it to 16 GB. They told me that you will loss all months in your plan if you changed. That is so so so stupid.",0
"Started an account with AT&T.  They came out and installed everything.  The techs that came out to bury the cable buried it two inches into the ground (supposed to be six inches deep).  The next door neighbor's dogs chewed up the wire after that so I lost signal. Two days later, they came back out and reconnected it.  The dogs chewedthrough the wire AGAIN.  I canceled the account.  I was told wouldn't be charged for the week of service I received because of my bad experience.  Three weeks later, AT&T used my banking info to charge my account $262.72, disrupting my finances and causing me to file a dispute with my bank that involved providing testimony, a time-line of events and the receipt from the equipment being returned.",0
AT&T saves a ton of money by asking there customers to have auto pay and paperless billing! They failed to include those discounts for 3 billing cycle to my account but after I inquire about it they can  credit the current billing cycle only. The nerve of these billions dollars companies!!!!!,0
There over the phone support is horrid. 2 hours to get refunded for a mistake they made and they tried to get me off the phone and not refund me several times before finally escalating it.,0
Absolutely horrible customer service. Been deployed overseas and tried to get my phone unlocked which has been a hassle. They said it would take 24-48 hours to get my device unlocked. I have been here a week and they still haven't unlocked my phone and are still charging me $12 a day for international saying it will take 3-5 more business days to review my account and unlock my phone. The worst phone company i have ever dealt with and once my devices are paid off I am switching carriers to a company that actually cares about it's customers!,0
Will leave ATT ASAP. Customer service wanted to debate with me on what kind of ATT store I went to vs fix the root problem which is the information that their stores put out inaccurately. If a store has a big ATT sign it represents the company. Regular end-users do not know if they are contacted or corporate nor should it matter they should give out accurate information. They all told me my day pass for international would cap at 10 days but apparently this is not so for first net.,0
"We live in Queen Creek AZ and our local AT$T promised great coverage and 5g connectivity. All we get, even at home is dropped calls and dead zones for coverage. All over town it’s the same thing. This is the worst service we’ve ever had.",0
Abouslte horrible service and customer service. They will not help you with anything if you have issues. They are just plain greedy. Please choose Verizon wireless or T-Mobile.,0
"Even one star is too much for such a thief company.I am extremely disappointed with my experience with AT&T not only have I been charged with unexplained fees, but the way my device return was handled is unacceptable. I followed their instructions exactly and used the prepaid label they provided to send back my phone. I even have proof of delivery with tracking umber, the original receipt of USPS, yet they are now falsely claiming they never received it.This situation has cost me both time and money, and their customer service has been unhelpful throughout the entire process. Instead of taking responsibility, they are pushing the burden on me, which is absolutely unfair. I trusted them, but unfortunately, this company seems more interested in dodging accountability than resolving legitimate issues and ripping of their customer with lies and nonsense.I would not recommend AT&T  to anyone—be careful if you need to return anything or dispute a charge and for sure they steal your money.Max. Abedian",0
I bought an iPhone 15 pro max about 6 months ago and broke a screen protector about three months in. Brought in and it was replaced without question. I was told they were covered throughout the first year. Broke that new screen protector about two months in again. Went to AT&T where they tried to charge me $10. Saying only the first one is covered. I just bought 3 screen protectors and 3 camera lens protectors for $6.99. Why would I pay 10 for one (with AT&T phone insurance mind you) when I can get 3 of each protector for $7?Their cell coverage has went to hell as well.This was on 10/13/2024.,0
"Tried to restart a plan I had for 15 years with 2 lines, tried another carrier for 62 day The rep  said 59 day is the cut off for reactivation and would not make an exception !!! so I had to start a new account. I  was speaking to was in SOUTH EAST ASIA , I gave my name, address drivers license with expiration date they insisted on my FULL SS, NO WAY, SOUTH EAST ASIA is the capital of identity theft , so unfortunately the call ended with no reactivation,  total BS",0
"It’s Sunday and I call about phone repair and the first thing they should say is our offices are closed (Because how would I really know if they are or aren’t open) But no…. they put you through all the paces…. they ask for the phone number… they check the phone that you’re calling about for Repair. They ask if somebody’s gonna be there when they show up they asked for a number to get a hold of you if need be ….it’s about a five minute  ordeal  and THEN they say “sorry we are closed, call Monday.” Why in the world don’t they just say before  they started the whole conversation “we’re CLOSED today!!!!!”just a waste of my time!",0
I have called multiple times on a billing issue. They never can answer or resolve a simple issue.Unfortunately I just upgraded my phones and am stuck with the bad service for another 3 years-It happens every time- no worse custumer service than ATT.,0
"Unable to change password.  I received notice that my password has been breached so I want to change it.  Using their page, I continually get the ""something went wrong"" message.  Go to service, no numbers to be found.  The most intelligent AI chatbot does not understand ""I want to talk to someone"" and happily points me back to the login page.  It does not work.  Have I been hacked, I don't know yet.  But AT&T surely isn't too concerned if I have.",0
Very very disappointed.in the hurricane time no network .when we needs important time .pay 100$ month not a jokes man.even simple mobile works better they really need to fixed this buks.,0
"I would give them a 0 or F for a provider. After data leak and our bill steadily getting higher for no apparent reason we decided to change companies. At$t told us that they would release our phones in 72 hours when their website says 24 our new phone agent mentioned this to the AT&Tguy and he said no they would not release our phones til the 72 hours are up, then they turned our phones off before the 72 hours were up and still would not release our phones even though they are paid off leaving us no choice but to buy new phones through the new company. They are liars and thieves. It should be criminal. AT&T at one time was a good company, but NOT no more! They will rob you then leave you hanging.",0
I signed up for AT&T a month ago I was guaranteed a price of $69.48 a month. My bill is now doubled that for the first month they took my phone in trade told me they would give me $1000 credit for it and now we’re only offering to give me 200 and change I don’t remember the exact amount but we’ll say $250. They are liars and I’m looking to find out if there’s any class action lawsuits against them that I or we the American people can join,0
"I am very disappointed and I will be signing up with a different cellphone provider. ATT ran a promotion regarding trading in a phone to get the flip phone free. I traded in my phone however, due to the representative at the Southfield store swearing up and down that I was signed in with the correct plan for the promotion, he lied. Even though it was ATT fault they said that they cannot honor the trade in promotion however, you still got my phone. I will no longer like to do business with ATT any longer.",0
AT&T has awful customer service. They are crooks. They charge you when you  are no longer with the company. I transferred over to T-Mobile and AT&T keeps charging me even after I left. I was told to pay the final bill before I could have my number transferred and I paid it. Now the company keeps charging me monthly and late fees. No rep. Can find my account because they closed it out and I cannot see exactly what they are charging me 200$ for. This is not a trustworthy company to be with. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. The government needs to look into how they are  falsely and over charging people who no longer wish to be with the company. I stayed with this company for so long because I wasn’t closely looking at all the things they were doing to my account. When I did realize how they were paying the bill way too early when I had auto pay and the bill kept going up without me noticing it because it was auto pay. Stay as far away from this company as possible.,0
"AT&T internet has the worst customer services/call centered!!!When I moved to this new city, a sales rep knocked on the door and convinced me to sign up with AT&T, what was my nightmare started.First encounter was the monthly bill. I was told was $65 p/m, yet the bill was ~$70 some. I called and told I need to signed up with directly pay by credit card get the discount, I did.The following month however, the bill was higher the previous month. I called again; I was told there was an email sent to me by AT&T regarding the price increase... How could a multi-billion-dollar company jerks up price just like that? nonetheless, the call center guy suggested that If I chose a different plan, it would be cheaper but the same speed, I did.The next month, the bill was even higher but the virtual meetings were hanging. I called, I wanted to use the precious plan when I just signed up. I was told that if you use my bank account for directly pay and paperless, I would pay $15 less each month, I did.This month, my bill was $25 higher... I called for explanation. Again, someone from an overseas call center telling me that all discounts would apply after 1-2 billing cycle, which was the policy. This did not make sense from financial transaction perspective. I argued that the previous guy did not tell me this policy, asked the I was speaking to send me the policy, was told he did not have my email...It has been an on-going frustration with AT&T.Any suggestions for other internet providers?",0
"Unfortunately I don’t have the same experience as most people because I’m a 100% disabled veteran who was ran over twice by two different people, the second of which caused me to have a bone infection and had to have my left big toe surgically removed. During which time AT&T cut off my service. I don’t intend to ever use the company again and don’t recommend it to anyone else because they are not professional or patriotic in any way.",0
"I wish I could rate them 0 stars. The worst phone company by far and their customer support is filled with liars. I've been getting a 1MBPS speed for a few months now and have to rely on WiFi while I pay for their premium internet package. I spent 2 hours in an AT&T store on Sunday to hear from them that I should call 611...then an hour and a half waiting for Tech Support who then says I need Advanced Tech Support and forwards me to the billing department...I wait another 30 mins to be told by the billing department that they are sorry for me and they schedule a call for Tuesday at 2 PM > which is now the loyalty department...who tells me yes sorry but we cant give you any credit (just stick with your 1MBPS and pay for premium package)...let me pass you to Advanced Tech Support > then sends me to home internet after another 10 mins of waiting...and then home internet forwards me to Advanced tech Support...who tell me I need to speak to backoffice support....i am on a call with them right now...SHAME ON THIS COMPANY. If you ever have an option please stay away from AT&T it is by far the worst phone company with a horrible customer support,",0
I paid for service that said I got wifi-calling and for 2 months I didn't have wifi-call.  So in fact they sold me a false bit of good. That is called false advertisement!!!,0
Another one star review for at&t and i don’t feel  about even getting to explain why. The worse many stealer phone company.,0
"Thieves, liars, and manipulators. These folx will say ANYTHING to get you in the door and then steal from you. They lie about everything from costs to speeds to bill discounts. I’ve never dealt with a more f*cked up company and I e we’re with both Verizon and T-Mobile. Shameful service and horrible management that has no idea what they are doing. Absolutely disgusted and now left without any recourse to correct their mistakes. I hope this company takes a nosedive and gets shut down. Won’t happen, but would be great to see.",0
I hit 140 judder bars daily at laeast..in auckand..pissed off..and angry at  and acc.,0
These people are horrible.. T-Mobile is much better. Especially if you need to set up a payment arrangement.,0
Horrrible horrible place!!!! I accidentally suspended my service somehow and for a month it being told it’s being worked on and now I find out after spending hours and hours on the phone that’s it’s gonna be another 3 weeks…. I plan on canceling all my services including my 3 cell lines that I had for 15 years……,0
Terrible customer service . You stay on hold for hours than get transfered to someone to stay on hols some more. Customers time doesn't matter to them at all,0
Got to be the worst service provider ever..3 days of calling to get a Human that could tell me what my next bill will be.Then they say it is a estimated price because the tax and fees change monthly.  IF it is a set billing how can the price change monthly..,0
In/out phone service for a week.... NO SERVICE for last 3 days.... totally unable to make and or receive calls as well as texts.... No cooperation with ATT as rep claims problem has been resolved,0
I am so sick of ATT!! I am trying to leave and carry my number over to another carrier. You would not believe the insane difficulty!!! I have been  trying to do this for 3 days now. It is one thing after another. I don't like being held hostage because I decided to leave. Every time I call in I am placed on eternal hold!!!! For the past 3 days call volumes have been high??? and online there is always some mystery number that is missing so that my request can't be completed. I want to SCREAM. Just let me out!!,0
Purchased a prepaid phone the Ai lady says it's activated and ready but the phone doesn't call out or receive calls  $ 69.24 and still can't make a call no customer service what so ever,0
Would like to when I got service said the bill would be $70 plus tax is well over $90 a month he said it was a free phone but I'm making payments on it each month and a 3-year contract called customer service they were horrible seems like every word comes out of their mouth is a lie,0
They misrepresent them selves.  They tell you one thing then the do another and then they raise your bill and tell you they can't do anything about it.  I was told I was upgrading and lowering my bill then when I get the phones (dont' even unbox them) my bill went up $100 then trying to get it taken care of I am speaking with 3 different reps and they can't keep what they say straight! Besides the fact TERRIBLE SERVICE,0
WORSE COMPANY IN THE USA..........HOURA OF WAIT TO GET THROUGH AI ROBOTS ON A ROUND ROBIN TO GET A SIMPLE ANSWER. ABD ROBOTS THAT LIE ABOUT WAit TO SPEAK TOA HUMAN!,0
"AT&T has the worst customer service and everybody at the store will lie to you to get any results. They can just sign you up so as far as AT&T is concerned, service is definitely the worst people lie to you and their customer service. They don’t even talk to you. I was waiting on the phone for customer service. They said give you give me 10 minutes then an hour later nobody still answered the phone again. AT&T is the worst company ever And they’ve gotten worse and they’re gonna keep getting worse because they don’t care about any of their customers that’s how bad they are now",0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. The worse company and I been with them for years. They charged me for two accounts when I upgraded from uverse to internet air. When caught it, they know the amount they owe, have case numbers, spoke to 6 reps, and still have not been refunded.",0
The problem I have with this company is that they really really really don't want to talk to you. I need to talk to a human being when there's a problem and their menus are designed to avoid that at all costs. I will never do business with them again over this.,0
I came home from work today (Friday) and my internet was down. They said that they wouldn’t fix it until Tuesday. I pay $80 per month for service that is intermittent at best. Wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone.,0
"Honestly for the money they charge for service, including hidden fees and taxes, you would think the customer service would be up to par. My experience with At&t has been miserable. From overcharges, to customer service misinformation, its really sad at the end of the day. Ive only been with them for about 5 months and have been calling for the past 4 months to gain access to my account online because one of their reps decided to input the wrong email for my user id. Which for some reason they are unable to correct over the phone, and insist I go back to the store where I purchased the phone ( I really do not see why it would matter). On top of that every time I do call the customer service line, I risk the chance of the call dropping and having to start the process all over again ( because their customer service reps seem to be operating on a different phone service, and do not hesitate to remind of this possibility every-time I call). My bill should have been one flat rate but since the first month, I seem to owe more and more money. I do not understand how they pride themselves on below standard customer service and robbing people. Say what you want, but I cant wait to switch to another service provider. Its alway a gamble every billing cycle, and they do not seem to care about customer complaints or holding their customer service reps accountable. There service is not worth the money or the time, and they really should hold a company meeting on improving in the customer service area instead of focusing on the profit section for once.",0
"Canceled acct, 6 days into new billing cycle charges me for a full month.",0
"If I can put no stars, I would I don’t know how I came this far but I’ve been with AT&T almost 2 years. I still have a YEAR and 5 months to go Come to find out I’m under a contract that they will not let me get out of. I lost my job due to health issues. they will not let me return the phone, even if it’s in great condition They want to bill me $400 remaining on the phone, but they will not let me return the phone they will not let me leave the contract. I would not recommend AT&T to anybody not even my worst enemy. AT&T sucks, including when I have no service or signal they don’t reverse me What I missed AT&T sucks. Do not I repeat do not switch or make contact with them.",0
I wanted to pay my AT@T Mobility Bill on the telephone. Voice mail said that. To talk to a live representative. You will be charged a $5.00 Dollar convience fee on next bill. We all know that this business already hits us with alot of nonsense fees already. This is unreal. To be charged a convience fee to pay your bill.,0
Those scammers told me that they owe me money but instead they charged me 150 even though it was supposed to be 80. If AT&T is watching this get ready to shut down this crapcompany I will be sure you will get no money forever but start owing the people more than billions,0
Worst company ever I never activated service and sent equipment back and never got a refund and talk to corporate this is embarrassing and shameful at this point I just want a refund I canceled everything ypu all should be fired for not doing your job and adjusting my billing this is wrong on so many levels,0
"I have constantly had problems with ATT service. Earlier this week, I visited the ATT store to upgrade my phone and was good to go but told that my trade in would gain $600 if I fixed the screen so I went and paid $220 to have it repaired. Then I returned and was told then that it wasn’t eligible. I had to visit the store two times to try to upgrade, eventually ending in a conversation with ATT customer service, as the store advised, before finally getting told that their system was the problem and there was nothing they could do. My phone has been paid off for nearly a month and they could see it on their end, but couldn’t do anything. I was told wait another month and try again.This is just one time of many that I have had issues. The last time I upgraded, I was told that I needed to switch internet plans and the rate was set but it went up after a month (nearly $30!).I’m officially switching to a company that is cheaper and easier to work with. There are SO MANY options that are cheaper than AT&T.",0
"I have been on/off the phone with AT&T since noon today. They have disconnected me three times. I'm simply trying to set up a new LAND LINE service for my mother, who is a senior and disabled. She cannot use a cell phone. They keep trying to get me to buy a flip phone, add internet, or add direct tv. This is not a service that is available to do on their website. You have to call. I have explained, re-explained and explained again. I have had a call back that I've waited 40 minutes for and then when I'm transferred, I get disconnected. I have been on the phone now for 27 minutes, have spoken to two separate people and nobody seems to understand what I'm trying to do, which is really, really simple.",0
Wish I had read these reviews sooner.Trying to get service to our house has been a nightmare. It's been over a week with no internet and can't get a service person to come out within the time frame that they quoted us.Service was awful and wouldn't make us a priority on their service schedule any of the other days.Will be looking for new provider. Do better.,0
They suck !!!!!!,0
"If I could give zero stars, I would.  Alexander Graham Bell would be so ashamed that the company he founded has zero integrity today!!The company changes their operating systems without notifying customers.  And, I strongly believe that this is in an effort to have customers enroll in auto-pay or be charged a service fee for having a customer service rep process the payment.  I, for one, will never enroll in auto-pay with AT&T as I do not trust them!!For years I have paid my internet bill through the automated system.  Then since the last 6 months or more each time I call the system automatically routes me to a live agent. None of the reps with whom I spoke since this started happening was able to explain why this was happening.  Finally, today I got a rep who explained that the system started linking my phone number with an account I had some time ago for phone services (and which I no longer have).  Now, I would have to key in the account number for the internet service.This is not the first time that shady ATT changed their system and created confusion and frustration for customers. For over 10 years I had been paying my bills thru the auto system using a bank account and had never used the 4 zeros with which the account started.  Suddenly last year, the auto system could not recognize my banking info.  Almost a year and several calls later, I was told that I now had to key in the 4 zeros.If the company truly cared about the customers, we would be notified when these changes are made.  Or at least, the customer service reps should be properly trained so that they can resolve these issues for the customers.",0
"AT&T is a sorry excuse for customer service! I wrote a review a week ago. I want to know how to get in touch with corporate. They need to train their customer service team in having respect. Ask me if you can call me Lisa. I went on the Crap App to upgrade a phone and for 45 minutes I couldn’t find the line I wanted to upgrade. It kept bringing me back to my line. All the devices should show up anyway.  Then I do the surveys and it still doesn’t touch on the issue I had. I was going to put it in the comments, but it shut me down before I could. I would change my service but I don’t trust I will get a better service.🤷",0
Well I had to hook up a line just to see if I had service! Found out I did so after 5 days I switched from Verizon to AT&T and now they sent me a bill for 303 plus 139 and they will not help me figure out why or how to fix it!! It’s true what they say grass is not greener on the other side!! Customer service is horrible!! Service is mediocre at best!! I would highly recommend a different provider!! Wait times are insane,0
"Don't get involved in AT&T.international conversation, they charged 125 dollars, then we canceled it, they issued an invoice of about 500 dollars without any evidence, in short, they bring your money to the game and take it from your pocket, international conversation is free in other operators, so stay away from ATT",0
"You must be very careful with this company and the extra charges they put on your bill. It is very important that you know that even if you are using your phone in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi they will still charge you for roaming. Their operating mode is to steal in one way or another.",0
"I am with an AT&T customer service for about more than an hour and the lady her name is Heidi, her expertise level is zero. She doesn't know about anything. She is doing nothing but putting me on hold.",0
AT&T is an absolute garbage company multi million dollar company and its service is garbage hundreds of s Signal towers all over the fück!ņg city and its service is still ass. It can’t play a simple video from the comfort of your home and will take five years to load. I’m pretty sure some cheap ass company like cricket or mint mobile has better service than AT&T. I’m so fed up with this garbage ass service.,0
"On 9/18- I tried to upgrade my Google pixel 6 pro to a Samsung Galaxy 24+ online. I had problems, so I had to contact AT&T via chat. They called me and did the entire transaction including payment. It went easy and I received the phone on 9/23. I did my data transfer and put in my sim card on 9/25, immediately my account was shut down at 6:15pm. I didn't understand what happened, so I had to use another cell phone to contact AT&T. It took 20 mins to get a rep on the line.She went through my acct, saw I owed nothing (I always pay my bills on time) and then asked me if I reported a lost/stolen phone. I told her no. She asked me if I had the Google pixel 6 pro and Samsung 24+ phones in front of me and I told her yes. She said ok, but she couldn't fix my acct she would have to transfer me to technical support. This took 45 mins.Technical support came on the line and started interrogating me. He asked me where I bought the phone, how did I do the transaction, when did I get it. I had to read the EID numbers off each phones and then he put me on hold, then he came back to ask me more questions. At this point I got upset, I told him to review their records since AT&T did the transaction, they sold me the phone, they sent me the phone, they should have everything in their records so stop interrogating me and look everything up. He put me on hold again and eventually came back on the line to tell me, he is sorry- on Sept. 17th; the phone they sent me was reported stolen. However, it was taken back to the store and then sent to me. When I put my sim card in the phone, it shut down my account since now it looked like I stole the phone.I told him, ok how are you going to fix this since I also use my phone for work. This is unacceptable. It took him another 25 mins to get my acct on line, so my sim card could work in my old phone. I had to drop the ""stolen phone"" to the UPS store so they could receive it(on 9/26).I called them today, 9/30. Another process getting them on the phone. Another issue getting them to recognize that they now have the ""stolen phone"" which they have now even started to process. The phone is still on my acct. Even though they admit this is completely their fault once again, I can't get a new phone or have anything done for another 7 days. Then, they will give me back my money and I will have to redo the process again myself.Throughout this entire process, all I'm getting is empty apologies. No recourse for their actions. Since they will not send me the phone I actually paid for, they will have to refund my money. They will not re-send me the samsung 24+ phone, because even though they admit they sent me the ""stolen phone,"" on my account it looks like I used a stolen phone; therefore now even once they clear it, they can't do anything.I don't want anything to do with a company that treats customers like criminals, when the company makes a mistake. Once I get my money, I'm going to Verizon or Team Mobile. Just wanted to let the public know. Great customer support AT&T, you really show much you value our time and business.",0
"(Pun intended)  HORRIBLE customer service.  Several minutes to try and wade through an automated answering system which cannot understand you.  And Heaven help you if you don't have a problem that fits neatly into one of their little categories - because at that point, the automated service will say to you ""Sorry you're having trouble.. Please try again later..""   And that's it  - You're done.On the occasions when you DO reach an actual human.. they are half a world away, with accents so bad that you cannot understand them, and ending up spending an inordinate amount of time asking them to slow down - WHICH they will confuse with ""Speak Up"".  At which time you have to remind them that you can Hear them just fine... It's not a volume issue.  It's a diction issue.  And that's when they break into 'script' mode.  They communicate by reading from that script... and CONSTANTLY ""thanking you for that information"".  And then eventually hanging up on you.I Called the toll free number that was ON MY LAND LINE BILL - spent 30 minutes trying to explain my issue to someone who had zero working knowledge of the language.. only to find out .. .that he was SOMEHOW with the cell phone division.  And so, I got to begin the process all over again.Issues that could be handled in a matter of minutes will often take hours because of this.  AT&T is essentially giving a big middle finger to it's client base, saying .. .""There's not much you can do ..  as WE are a shining monument to what can be accomplished when there is virtually NO Competition.""There are over SEVEN THOUSAND negative reviews on Trust Pilot alone - this should be some indication that AT&T isn't about to fix a thing.  I would consider letting AT&T know about my review, as TP suggests.  Why bother... it's clear they don't care.",0
"Bad service, 2022 still 5Ge omg you know e mean that is 20 years ago , 5 lines $150 but tax high total bills will be $245, internet super slow cant loading Facebook , send iMessage picture take forever, if you send more then 3 pictures that mean failed cant sending, now 36 months contract, not like what agent said, i used Tmobile before, Tmobile the best price, no tax at all , super fast internet .

Hurricane Helene victim here. ATT is NOT helping hurricane customers!,0
"We were sold ATT cellular at $120 p/m for 4 lines and new iPhones included.  We were happy with T Mobile at $170 but saving $50 per month and getting new phones is a good deal.  After several weeks of hell it’s apparent that the sales rep lied through his teeth.  Our bill is well into the high $200s and as of yet no one can really confirm what it will be in the end, but it certainly won’t meet his written quote.  ATT keeps giving us different stories and can’t seem to confirm anything.  This is just an atrocious con and the salesman and his supervisor have ghosted us.",0
"Customer service is absolutely garbage,  is so full of *hit that is about to explode,  worse than you can imagine!!!!",0
"Everything they say is a lie. Signed us up and then literally 30 later everything was not as they said. We signed up with Ashley in Friendswood, TX. He drove around in a BMD in our neighborhood. HE LIED. HE SET UP OUR ACCOUNT ALL WRONG. In the end we are paying TWICE as much as the rate we had a Tmobil, service is terrible, and every month is more bs charges we have to call and fight. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST.",0
"ATT was hacked twice and even didn't notify customers for a few months. ATT doesn't protect customer's personal info. I receive a lot of scammers calls, I block them, even don't answer, but other similar numbers continue bothering me. I receive creepy text messages of unknown people pretending than they know me. ATT have to clean up their system of dark web,scammers,spammers and other criminals. It isn't safe to use ATT already. It hurts businesses, people, consumers, economy....Yes, because people are SCARED to answer and be comfortable in ATT system. Even now,posting this,I am worried that scammers don't use my e-mail address just because ATT don't care!!!  Thanks.",0
"Once again AT&T is failing me. If you use AT&T cell services, you cannot reach my office phone. It goes to instant fast busy, AGAIN!! There is some glitch and AT&T and our VIOP provider both are pointing fingers at each other. "" Its their fault "", meanwhile,  I still can't reach my own office from my cell. What a frustrating and utter failure AT&T and DataTalk Telecom / Intermedia  have been for us. If you run a business,  who do you use for Voice Over IP?  This has happened multiple times, with hours and hours of arguing and chasing tails on the phone.  Customer service sucks! Automated system sucks. People who can't speak or understand clearly as phone techs, SUCKS! Your inability to recognize and remedy an issue like this is insane andpathetic.",0
"I was in Walmart when an AT&T associate stopped me and offer me a ""FREE"" phone. He said that I have just to move my line from T-Mobile to AT&T and I will get the phone for free. I started the process and before finish he told me that I have to trade my iPhone 14 Pro Max. I asked him if he is crazy because I never would do that. I called the Walmart Manager and he made him cancel everything. But I start to receive an activation bill from AT&T. I went back there and he called AT&T and did not fix it. I called AT&T and I experience the worst costumer services in the world. They left me waiting for 57 minutes and hang off the phone. I called so many times and they do not solve the problem. If this goes to my credit I will take them to the court.",0
I hate everything about Att home internet service! When I moved in my apartment complex I learned they contract with Att & only offered service through them. I never wanted Att & it has been terrible ever since! They add fees to everything to where I’m stuck paying 90 dollars for basic internet. They even charge if they take your payment on line. Spectrum would never! I’m starting a petition where I live to allow spectrum. Do not recommend att for anything,0
This is the worst company I have ever hadEvery time I want to talk to a customer service it takes forever and once I get through its the same old excuse as to why I have no service every afternoonWorks great in the morning but nothing once it hits 3 pm and onI will not be paying this company anymore moneySo if they turn me in to collections so be itI'm going to file a complaint with BBB and see what I can get doneI would not recommend this company to anyone,0
"We had AT&T wireless for 8 months, and the service was SO TERRIBLE, we needed to switch back to TMobile. We asked AT&T to unlock our phones 3 days before the end of the billing cycle, so we wouldn't get charged for another month. But sneaky AT&T would not and did not unlock our phones until the first day of the new billing cycle, when we were finally able to free. THEN, they charged us $125 for the new billing cycle, even though they held our phone numbers hostage beyond when we asked for termination. Seems like fraud to me!!",0
At&t refuses to unlock my phone that  i own and tried to extort me for 6 more months of service to unlock.  This is grand larceny.  Extortion scheme.  And overpriced garbage service.  Youre welcome.,0
"Lindsey came to my house on 4/12/24 offer a $1000 gift card. I’ve received $800. I have called rewards and they say it has to come from Lindsey, Lindsey refused to answer up till today. She provided me her boss email. I got the first gift cards around the end of May. June 4th she “submitted a ticket” and said the card was shipped but never activated. Since June I’ve heard no contact till today and she was very demanding on not speaking with me. I’ve emailed her “boss” and no luck.. this company offers false promises. Do Not Recommend BEWARE OF LINDSEY A SALES REP THAT COMESTO YOUR HOME!!!",0
AT And T is a scam company.  Told bill would be cheaper than Verizon.  Almost triple now.  Run from this company while possible.  Nothing was explained properly.   Turned in old phone like was told.  Did not get any credit like I was told I would,0
"AT&T customer service is the worst in the world. Crazy security validation, very long wait before speaking to someone and the rep is completely useless, unable to provide services or done anything right. Extremely frustrating calling their customer service. I have avoid calling them at cost except emergency issues. Worst in the world.",0
The only reason I gave AT&T one star is because I made me they don't get any stars. The employees they have working for them don't know what they are doing and they can't even understand what you are saying. I swear I was talking to a 10 year old no a 10 year old would do better then the AT&T employees. I was on the phone for 2 hours the other day I asked the employees over 30 times to transfer me to a manger. Every time he would ask a question I asked for a manger. I can't wait to switch provider's I hate AT&T and i'm going to put up a bad review everyday to get the word out. AT&T is a scam don't set your account up on auto they will go in your account and take what they want when they want. And they when you want your money back they will take for ever to refund. Or they will keep you on hold for hours because they know people don't have time to hold for  2 hours about a refund. They took $222 on 9-12-24 and they weren't suppose to take it till 9-20-24 then they were suppose to refund but I never got the refund and they wanted me to pay again on 9-20-24. I think the employees do it because they have no idea what they are doing. They have a AI note the accounts so their job all they have to do is talk on the phone and the AI notes the account for them and they still can't do their job right. AT&T sucks run don't use their service for cell phones or internet unless you like finding out where you money went and spending hours on the phone because nobody knows what to do,0
"I would leave them less than one star if I could. AT&T is one of the worst companies to do business with all the way around. Their service sucks, their customer service sucks and their business policies suck. I am not sure if anyone else has had this happen but I purchased phones from them on the next plan where I traded in phones to get the new ones and was to be paid a certain price for my phones. Well they were paying me monthly for the phones and then the service went bad as many people have experienced lately, so I cancelled my service and got a REAL service provider well at that point they charged me for the phones I had which I have no problem with but in turn they kept my phones I traded and now does not want to pay for them. I am trying to begin a class action lawsuit against them so if this has happened to you please let me know so you can be added.",0
Customer Service is the worst! We experience issues when trying to call out. Get a message that my phone is not registered to a network.  We have called multiple times. They have us make a few changes then restart phone and calls work until the next time I try to make a call. I shouldn't have to restart my phone every time I want to make a call or send a text. I called again yesterday and complained about the issue and why I pay so much money for such bad service. I was blatantly lied to by the rep. Was told the reason is because my payment is 5 days late. This issue has gone on for a lot longer than 5 days! Looking for new cell phone service now!,0
"We had a sales lady come to our home to switch from verizon to AT&T. We were excited to hopefully have better service in our area. With this being said our AT&T represenative was very nice and you could tell she was frustrated as well.  She arrived at 5pm and at 10pm still at our house and had to leave and none of our phones had been ported over. For my job I can't be without a phone. By noon the next day my phone was working but the other two on the plan were not. Around 24 hours later another line was working but my husbands was not. Several days go by and unfortunately as this time i receive a text that my husband has a new line and he needs to activate his phone. My husband some how loses his phone and so AT&T states to file an insurance claim. What no one tells you is that if the phone has been used then insurance won't replace it.... So after hours of speaking with AT&T and getting no where I had to purchase a phone out of pocket... Yes I understand my husband lost his phone and that is his responsibility, but if he had service and was able to use it then he probably wouldn't has set it somewhere and left it. It is frustrating to be told one thing and then have to deal with the extra. I should have stayed with Verizon. Unfortunately I will be staying with them. I was excited to be back with AT&T and it definately was a rough experience.",0
"I have cancelled their service on 8/5/2024 and have followed their instructions to return the equipments at a UPS store with my account number on 8/6/2024. I am grateful to the UPS staff who reminded me to keep the return receipt for 2 years, as AT&T may try to claim that I did not return the equipment.On 9/8/2024, I received a reminder email from AT&T claim that my AT&T equipments haven’t returned. The day after, I went to the AT&T store and spoke to the staff. They suggested me go back to the UPS store and check with them. Despite providing them with a receipt to proof the equipments were returned, they were unable to check for me as they claimed to not have contact with UPS. After spent over 30 minutes on the phone with them, they assured me everything was taken care of and made a note on my account.After a week - 9/15/2014, I receiving a reminding email again. I did not take any action as I assumed they needed more time to update their system. Unfortunately, I have now been charged a non-return equipment fee of $200. I have attempted to resolve this issue by reaching out through chat, but the virtual agent was not helpful in resolving the issue.This situation is frustrating and time-consuming and could have been easily avoided if AT&T had properly handled the situation. It is unacceptable for a company to charge customers for returned equipment, especially when proof is provided. This not only causes inconvenience for the customer but also wastes their valuable time and resources. It is important for companies to uphold their promises and provide efficient and satisfactory customer service.",0
"ATT customer is the ABSOLUTE worst that I have ever encountered. I own a business and if my customer service was as bad as ATT I would be out of business.  An ATT representative disabled my ATT.net email while trying to make another change three days ago.  So far I have spoken with literally 17 customer service reps, chatted online with 5, and visited my regions ATT corporate store.  And after spending HOURS AND HOURS ON HOLD, have not received one bit of assistance in fixing the problem.  Went back to the corporate store today and complained to a manager (the assistant store manager - Jonesboro, AR) about the horrible customer service.   His reply was that if I didn’t like the service to go somewhere else.  After three days of this…I AM BEYOND READY TO CHANGE CARRIERS!!!!  I need access to my email NOW!!!!",0
They don't let you easily cancel your internet service even if you have moved out ! They make the process challenging. You have to call many times. Not nice! Not ethical!,0
"AT&T's chat/call centers appear to be staffed by poorly trained people reading scripts. I suspect, based on some of the weird nonsensical answers, they are also using AI chatbots. AT&T's poorly trained staff are forced to deal with its poorly designed systems. Did an agent accidentally not activate your eSim properly while you're chatting with them and then pass you off to another agent? No problem, the new agent can (and must) text you a new PIN number and try the process again. You can't receive a text because your eSim wasn't activated? Well gosh, there is ABSOLUTELY nothing that can be done without visiting an AT&T store in-person. Want to go before work? Tough luck, they all open at 10 or 11 in the morning. Once an impasse like this is reached, you will be handed off (with no warning) to another agent who also can't help you. I went through 3. The last guy finally gave me a phone number for the ""Advanced Technical Team"". The message at that number said it closed in February of 2023. Here's the number: 888-855-2338, listen for yourself. Also, frustratingly, no part of AT&T is connected to any other part of AT&T, so enjoy repeating yourself.",0
"I recently switched from T-Mobile to Att a few days ago.  I had no idea att customer service was the worst experience I’ve ever had or I would have never switched.  I accidentally ordered the 256GB iPhone 16 but I wanted the 1TB iPhone 16.  I have called att for days, the customer service either can’t find my account, can’t find my order and when they do find something, something happens such as they cannot complete the exchange and will to call me back the next day to finish it or the call ends, it’s like they give up because they are lost and don’t know what to do.  And all the waiting made the wrong phone ship, so all that time wasted now I have to send the phone back, trying to contact att to send the phone back and do an exchange is a nightmare.  The incompetent customer service representative wastes an hour of my time by asking questions and keep asking me what I wanted to do and told me to call sales and gave me the number to call,  so after all that time wasted I call sales,  guess what?  I need to call customer service to do this.  So I call customer service AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! I wait on hold because their customer service is really bad so after 30 minutes of waiting the call fails.  This is really ridiculous.  I didn’t even add to this message the other days of back and forth with sales and customer service.  It’s no surprise to me ATT have majority 1 star ratings, doesn’t surprise me at all from what I had to experience just to exchange a phone.  I haven’t even been able to exchange it yet due to the many hours or waiting on hold or answering the same stupid questions over and over and their computers must be from 1980 because it takes them forever to look up anything on your account!!!!!  I wish I knew about this before switching, I would have stayed with Tmobile, it’s not worth this headache and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to exchange the phone with the way things are going,  it should not be this hard or complicated.",0
"Their customer service is the worst. I spent months, hours trying to get a credit due sent to me.  They kept passing me off to different people until I figured out they were just trying to keep from sending me the refund.  Waste of my time and they basically ripped off the money due to me because I gave up with the roundabout treatment they gave me which I feel is a trained tactic so as not to pay. Never use ATT again!",0
GARBAGE COMPANY. Can’t wait to get Verizon. I don’t even know why I gave these guys a chance what a joke. I didn’t know I would be charged for international minutes at 3 dollars a minute! A 30 minute phone call cost me almost a 100$ and they won’t waive it. Goodbye never EVER again.,0
"I signed up to trade in our phones, but then we changed our minds and cancelled the trade 3 days later. However, they still sent the phones. We asked them to email us return labels for all the phones, and we sent them back. Despite this, they still ported all my phone numbers to their network, leaving us without working phones. Now we are trying to get our numbers back. This company is a scam – stay as far away from them as you can.",0

We were incorrectly charged $199 for service transfer when we moved. Two representatives informed us by phone that there would be no charge for the U-Verse move. The retention department would not remove the fee even after we requested cancellation.,0
"I have started receiving alerts from my PPI monitoring services that my PPI was compromised during the AT&T breach upon which the alerts I received actually showed the information that was compromised. I called AT&T customer service upon to simply let them know and ask for the service they were providing to address the leaked PPI.When I spoke to a representative, I was told unless I knew the exact date my information was leaked AT&T's position is to not take responsibility for removing the compromised information from the Dark Web because their investigation revealed SS# were only leaked on specific dates.  I confirmed my understanding with the customer service representative and again asked for clarification that it is the position of AT&T not to take the due diligence to remove the information that was leaked. Again I attempted to explain I am receiving alerts  from my current monitoring services that are showing me what is out there with AT&T being the source.  Obviously. The representative was just following company procedures.  However, he offered no assistance, no customer service, no compassion, or concern for the situation AT&T is responsible for, other than to insist it couldn't be AT&Ts responsibility.  I have had AT&T cellular services for over 20 years. This is the third data breach with the company. Surprisingly, I havent had data breach issues of this severeity from all the other business and platforms I use, but have had three with AT&T.  AT&T is the only data breach that I have had that actually has mishandled my PPI that is vital to my identity verification. The company offered no incentive for their negligence to me. Their customer service was less than helpful, offered no possible course of action, did not have the knowledge/skills/desire to help educate me or even make any considerate attempt to reassure me if I have further troubles with this matter Att will be there to assist me.  Thus, I am responsible for the expense and detriment without so much as a concern from any company representative or the company itself.  My work phone is through another carrier who doesn't seem to have the blatant disregard for providing valued customer service or do they have repeated data breaches that have impacted me. Needless to say, it's been my personal experience there are better options for cellular services providers.",0
Horrible customer service constantly raising prices.It actually seems Like they are intentionally try too loose customer's .,0
worst customer service ever did lie about your charges. never get AT&T service it's a waste of time and money,0
AT&T has the very Worst Customer Service In the Country!!! When you call it is Next to Impossible to Get A Live Representative without going through the Virtual Assistant Giving You the Run Around. There App is Absolute Crap and is the Same! I’ve been with them 22 years and they want you to pay automatically! I don’t do automatic payments to anyone except my Life Insurance! I absolutely Despise Calling Them! They make to much Money to have   Poor Service like this🎉💙🎉💙,0

"If I can give them -* I willTerrible Service and Zero Resolution – A 7-Month NightmareI’ve been an AT&T customer for years, but the past 7 months have been a nightmare. I have had no service outside, meaning I can’t receive calls, use GPS, or access the internet. This has severely impacted my life, especially since I have kids and need to be reachable in emergencies. Despite calling customer service countless times (each call lasting 3-4 hours), I’ve been bounced from one department to another with no solution.To make matters worse AT&T has been raising my bill every month with no explanation, and they even charged me for international plan when I couldn't even use the service nationally! How am I supposed to use the service international when I can’t even get a signal here at home ?I’ve even gone to the store multiple times, only for them to call customer service again, wasting my time. Today, when I went back, the representative I spoke to was not only unhelpful but also rude in custome rcare her name is wanda i believe. I’ve been more than patient, but this situation has been completely unacceptable.I’m tired of paying for a service that I can’t use. I just want to return my phones and move on, but I’m worried about how it will affect my credit if I stop paying. AT&T’s lack of care and customer support has been incredibly frustrating, and it’s clear that they do not prioritize resolving customer issues. Save yourself the headache and go with a provider that actually values its customers.",0
Customer service is a robot. Can’t talk to a human about complex problems.   Worst experience ever,0
Worst company I have ever used.Worst customer service ever. Our bill went up almost double after less than a year. I had to cancel the account and paid them $2900 for early cancelation penalty. For 15 months I keeps on calling them to get the phones I had paid thousands of dollars for unlock so I can use them with the other carrier but could not get it done. They would make you wait on the phone until you hang up yourself.,0
"The service has gotten worse and worse over the years. If it did not work at our vacation house, we would dump AT&T in 3 seconds.",0
"Cancellation put in after years of service with them we switched due to high fees and sub par service.  Called and cancelled per stores request only to get another bill and stayement showing they didnt cancel the line.  They said their AI showed no record of the call. I told him I would screen shot the call log where I had a 23 minute conversation with the lady. He said again no record or the call, our AI would have registered it.... they will not credit the bill back. Garbage company. Look elsewhere",0
Terrible Company. Forced to have them for internet through apartment complex. I guess their terrible treatment of their workers led to a strike and that's why I haven't had internet for a month. Couldn't recommend them less. Very unreliable.,0
I have a problem with my phone I called  and was on hold for 1 hour then put on hold again for 45 minutes for them to transfer me! Then on hold off and on for the next hour while they ran test on my phone.

10 word minimum.I switched over to AT&T from metro.They promised me a free iPhone 15 pro.I've been charged $27 for 4 months now after l've already sent in my iPhone. The accredited themselves 60 more days to get the iPhone after they sent me a shipping label for the wrong address. Idk where they shipped my iPhone to and I'm still paying for a phone they told me was free. After confronting them 2 times they said they can't do anything for me. Once this is Done I will switch back,0

"AT & T (and I bundled TV and Internet with them for many years), about every two years would have a ""promotion"" and at the end of the two year promotion, I would have to negotiate with them because they would raise their prices up higher.  I was paying $205 a month, and now they want $253 a month or $572 additionally for a year!  Used to be a customer could talk and negotiate with a American Supervisor, NOT anymore, now you have to talk to a foreign representative who will NOT reduce your bill and the 2 year set promotions are apparently over with.  I am going to another cable and internet provider because AT& T, is toooooo greedy and now tooooooo foreign!  So they will LOSE $2460 a year by refusing to lower their bills, even for retired people on fixed incomes.  All AT & T is now, is a despicable and greedy Company!",0
"I'm only giving a 1 star because that's as low as I can go. I am totally frustrated with the rates, bill, service and customer service with AT&T. I am exhausted with calling them every month because of billing.  They charge you ten dollars if you dont sign up for paperless billing and AutoPay.  What a rip off! Not to mention all the blackouts they have. Maybe this is a sign to read books, because internet alone almost $100 a month & that's CRAZY WORK! No perks for your loyal customers,  all the so called ""deals"" are for new customers only! Do better AT&T & Execitives. I am livid with this trashy service & sky high pricing.",0
Worst customer service ever.  Our bill ended up being $60 more than they promised and our 1st bill was over $900 which is absurd. We had to file a complaint with the FTC to get this fixed.  Since then our bill has been slowly going up with no explanation and when you try to get someone on the phone you can't get past the automated system.  I absolutely hate this company and as soon as the contract is up I will switch and never go back.,0
AT&T has been a nightmare for me all morning they mislead me in paying a bill to get my services restored. They transferred me all over the place and completely lied to me…I was told once I paid the bill in full I would keep my services…I’m a single mom in this terrible economy and for them to lie and not give a clear understanding and take the last money I had for me and my family is the lowest of the lowest…I need my services in order to take care of my family and they just took my money in five mins and I have been trying to get services rerouted for four hours….i will never recommend this service to anyone…if anything I will slander the AT&T name and make sure they go completely out of business due to their lack or consideration and knowledge for its customers,0
Our reviews don’t seem to matter but hear goes. It is a nightmare calling customer support. You can barely understand anything the customer service clerk is saying and on top of that nothing is never really settled. I moved and wanted my service stop at one address and started at my new one. It’s bad enough I had to wait three weeks to get an appointment for someone to come out and hook up my internet. Each time I checked they still had my old address as the service address.,0
If I could leave negative stars I definitely would att worst cellphone service ever have had phone two months and have had nothing but problems no service dropped calls terrible mobile data no help from customer service,0
"I signed up for a trade-in with the deal where I was promised a credit on the bill; it has been seven and no credit, according to AT&T. They never received the divas.I've contacted customer services multiple times, and according to them, they never received my devis. No one is responsible.Waiting for them to help you can be hours, and customer service repeats the same thing: sorry for the inconvenience, but you know they don't care.In the future, I will be rethinking to do business with them.",0
"AT&T has to be the WORST phone service EVER!So... I returned my step-up (old phone) to AT&T on May 23rd.  For whatever reason, @USPS didn't register the track# of the phone until August, which puts me 60 days behind from not returning the phone. Mind you, I do have pictures & proof of when I sent the darn phone. AT&T still charged me $228 for a phone I no longer have for nonreturn.The worst part is, today 9/17/24, I just found out that AT&T DID receive the phone & is sending it back to me, instead of crediting my acct the $228 they now have in their possession...reason: ""It didn't qualify for the 30-day return""I told the ""Loyalty"" dept I needed to cancel my service & send their new phone back.  The lady told me, that if I sent the new phone back, AT&T would only apply $520 for it, as it is what the ""phone is now worth"" & I'd still owe them $742 for both phones, they would now have in their possession!!!  :((HOW ABSURD & UNFAIR IS THIS???? 😡They didn't even try to save me as a customer with all the proof they had or offer the credit to keep me 😡Since they wouldn't credit my acct & still have the phone, I cancelled it & I'm taking them to small claims court.Why wouldn't they credit my acct if the proof was there?  They know @USPS is known to be trying to steal people's mails/packages",0
"Tried getting the names switched on the AT&T account an they screwed up so bad that it took 3 weeks plus 4 hours of failed attempts with the crap customer service, Apparently you now have to install your own router after their circus act an it’s $70 for that trash service so don’t waste your time with them you’ll regret it. Can’t believe AT&T is this bad an still waiting for my stupid new router 🤬",0

I was supposed to get a free phone due to a fathers day promotion. I've been paying for the new phone for 4 months now. I've been to the store multiple times and on the phone with customer service. The store tells me to call cust. serv. and cust serv. says to go back to the store. Do not believe any of the so called promotions they offer. I will be changing to verizon or some other carrier soon. I've been trying to resolve this issue for 4 months now. By by At&t.,0
"It's been a week without internet, my bill has been paid in full and early.I understand the company technician were on strike.I am a very punctual person.

"It took me two days and over 8 hours on the phone with customer service to get an iPad unlocked. The experience was so horrific that I switched all my devices to another carrier.

"AT&T is the WORST company and I suggest you never, ever, ever use them! Someone very special to me bought me my phone from an AT&T store as a gift, but when he got the phone he put it in his name not knowing the nightmare it wouldbe to get it out of his name to put in my name. We spoke to AT&t forover 3 Hours trying to get thetransfer pin and to  put the phonein my name and even after several phone calls with both of us on thephone with AT&t's customerservice the phone was NEVER putin my name! It made it almostimpossible for me to get anothermobile wireless company becauseAT&t is so expensive! They werecharging me almost twice whatany other company out therewould charge me for one phoneone line! Finally, after a year I wasable to go with another companyPaying less than half of what AT&T was charging me! Do not ever use AT&t they are a rip-off in my honest opinion!",0
"Att was never our first choice for internet. We thought it would be better than spectrum, and our apartment complex only offered the two choices.The equipment sent to us, was meant as a self set up. It did not work. Not when I did it myself, or when I had tech support on the phone. First available appointment  for a technician was a week after I got it.Fine.Tell me why the appointment I set durring the time window I was able to be present, was canceled?I was not contacted, I was not told why.One day, I was using text confirmation, the next I was told they missed my appointment and I needed to reschedule. The next available appointment was 3ish weeks out.Set into the next month, after they'd have billed me for the first month of internet I never had a chance to use.I canceled Att and started with spectrum, had it set up less than 24 hours later.It doesn't end there. Because even though I've canceled Att, never got to use the service, and have returned all equipment in a timely manner; Att still auto payed what would have been the monthly fee from my account.The customer service representatives are very nice.The service is not very good.Their infrastructure for matanaince in my area is not very good. And I'd say their customer service on matanaince is also not very good, since I was never even given a courtesy call when the appointment was canceled.And, their systems are garbage, if my service was canceled and I was still somehow charged a phantom bill after being told they would not charge me.Do better Att :/",0
"Spent 6.5 hours today with ATT customer service and @ four - five different representatives and an alleged manager. They are the absolute worst I’ve ever experienced when it comes to service, being helpful, outright lying, nor honoring what they are offering on their web. It started with a simple question on AARP discounts ATT offers, and the amount of ineptitude, misinformation, spin, not knowing the information on most anything, bait/switch, upselling, differing information, changing conditions/pricing at nearly every turn was reprehensible. Then their practice of blaming the customer on not understanding after all their bait/switches, misinformation, and oops…sorry we now can’t offer that…, etc. I’ll be looking for other carriers. Truly terrible and taking advantage of customers.",0
At&t is a untrustworthy. They will steal your data then lie and tell you that you have used it up. At&t are true thefts and crooks and I stand on that.To Who It May Concern I'm down for suing AT&T that's my email,0
"AT&T is a joke, they costumer service is useless, I cannot sign into my account and, they are asking for security questions, I have never seen before. so, I cannot get into my email. call after call and they told me it could take up to 30 days to get it fixed.  well time is up. still trying to get help, I need information that is in my email, I contact my cancer Dr with my email, also I have a lawyer I need to get information from my email to contact but they act like they do not care. I don't know what to do. as big as AT&T is you would think they could take care of a little email problem. I spoke today (9/16/24) to a guy and said they could not help me.",0
"I hate AT&T they are a rip off,,,,There is to much compitition out therewe can switch to anyone better, want to charge me 55,00n to return a phone what a rip off,  just turn me into collections  i dont care tried to charge me 35$ connections fee",0
Had to call customer service multiple times on a Sunday night. Sunday night CS calls are evidently sent over seas. I could hear EVERYTHING  going on in the background. Sounded like they were watching a soccer game or celebrating a birthday. On the 3rd call I found someone  that could help me. I had to resort to calling because the chat is a bot and completely useless. I just got a new iPhone. Probably should've given Verizon a try this time although I doubt that would be much different. I'll wait until Monday for support to avoid the offshore call center,0
"Okay, going to take a moment to vent and to save anyone else the grief.  First of all I have ATT as my wireless provider and my internet provider.  Well, a couple months ago we were having issues with our phones and we took them to the ATT Store in Valpo.  They were awesome.  They fixed her phone and found us some ""savings"" on our account.  I haven't really seen much of that but that's not the point.  They also convinced us to with to switch to their internet air by offering a considerable discount.  While I wasn't thrilled to switch to internet by air for my home internet, they had a trial period and the discount was substantial enough to make me try it.  Well, the end of the trial came and the service was, in a word, eh, but just as good as what I had so with the promised discount, I determined worth it.  Well, one month went by and the discounted rate was not applied.  Two months, three months, still nothing.  Finally I called to ask where the discounted rate was.  After about 20 minutes, the apologized and stated that the discount did not apply since we were already an ATT internet customer.  I explained and asked why did they think I would switch if the discount didn't apply since I had their service already?  After about 20 minutes I was promised that they would honor the agreement made in store and apply the discount retroactive......Problem solved, right?  Nope.  Two months later still no discount.  I call again.  Same story, no discount since I was a current customer.  Again, I asked why would I have switched then if I wasn't promised a discount.  Surprisingly they had no answer.  This time however, after waiting 30 minutes on hold, I was told that I need to go back to the store and talk to them but they will not be giving me a discount on that service. So basically ATT lied to me twice.  I informed them that I will not be returning to the store.  I will be taking my overpriced wireless accounts and my home internet to another provider so the only contact they will get from me is how to return this egg.  So, the moral of the story.  If you have ATT, be aware they do not care about their customers and if you don't, LOOK ELSEWHERE.  Their service isn't that great and their company is a bunch of liars that will say anything to get you off the phone.  Oh, and I have been on a waiting list for well over a year for Fiber interned and still no closer.  Good thing at this point.",0
"The biggest thieves in this country are ATT and they justify everything, the service is not so good, they are professional thieves",0
"I Hate ATTIt has taken more than two hours to get thru to customer service on multiple occasions.An ATT employee sold my password that led to locking down our bank account for a week while someone tried to hack our bank account. No compensation from ATT.Recently waited more than two days for service people to show up. Untrained and didn’t have command of the English language.  Rude. Had to wait for another person to show up.Went without Astros games for more than three months last year (the only reason we continue to have direct tv), no compensation and Now AGAIN!  $30 credit this month and have to call back next month if direct tv still fails to provide what we are paying for!  Are you kidding me?Last spring att laid new line in my neighborhood. Workers who also didn’t speak English buried blooming bluebonnets when the dirt could have been easily thrown on the other side of the hole and spared the flowers!Supervisor claimed a note was left on our door that the work was scheduled. Never happened.We were home when they started the work. They never showed enough respect for the people who planted those flowers or the taxes we pay for this property!  They could knocked on our damn door!Att has a Lot to Learn about CUSTOMER SERVICE.",0
"Was swindled and conned to make a payment that w would restore service for Internet. After making payment, they cut service 10 days into the cycle without notice or warning and demanded the remaining balance was paid. Then spoke to an idiot named Josh, who really thought he was 11' tall over the phone, who was rude, hostile, confrontational, and unprofessional. Then refused to transfer me to his supervisor to discuss the issue since he was no help whatsoever, then disconnecting the call after waiting on the line falsely attempting to get his supervisor right before the call center closed. Had that service over 10 years, and that imbecile managed in a matter of minutes to kill all interest in retaining them as a provider. There's no way Josh should be employed by ATT, and knowing they're paying him to act that way has made me consider giving other providers a chance to gain business, especially since there's a need to update account information due to life events. They are crooks and I recommend you never ever use them for anything other than nothing.",0
"I would give them a negative, if I could. Bottom line 20+ yrs as a customer finally moved to T-mobile about a year ago. I cut my bill literally in half. Best decision ever. But AT&T  is not done with me. I tried to turn on one of my old phones. They are trying to get $500 for a watch line which they say has to be turned off separately. The charged me 75 a month for close to 6 mo and included late fees. What a ripoff? Run away, far away from this corrupt company. Never received so much as a notice regarding this.",0

"As every year, AT&T's chaos on the day Apple opens preorders for the new iPhone was unbelievable, and this year was the worst of all. After dealing with the constant issues on their website and thinking I had finally placed my order, it was canceled. I tried a few more times, and each attempt ended the same way. I finally spoke with a customer service agent, but after two hours of conversation, even he couldn’t figure out what the problem was.It’s frustrating and disappointing. After 14 years with AT&T, I’ve decided to look for another provider. The service quality has dropped too much, and it’s clear they don’t care about their customers or providing decent service.",0

"AT&T could not be more predatory.When they want your business, you'll see them every single day. But when you are trying to leave their service, it will be near impossible to reach anyone. I have wasted so many hours of my life going back & forth with them, only to be given false transfer PINs and false account numbers. Additionally, they've had so many data breaches that I really don't trust them with my info.For nearly $100/month, you'd think I could at least receive good customer service. But all I've gotten is lies. Don't get sucked into their trap.",0
"March 2024 I corresponded with an AT&T representative regarding pricing.  His exact words were the price will not go up for the following year.  The first month of the second year it goes up $6.September 12th, 2024 at 0235 am my internet goes offline.  Three separate calls to AT&T, my service is down along with 45 other residents.  One employee went as far to say AT&T techs are striking, management is clueless as to fix the issue therefore be prepared for a long term no-service.So literally a multimillion dollar company with upper management ran by morons with no concern for its customers.  I had to cancel two internet business calls and all I could get was a sorry but we can refund you $4.Unfortunately residing in Pensacola, Florida you are limited to finding quality internet companies and unfortunately stuck with low grade companies like AT&T with a 1.3 rating out of 5 being the best on BBB.  I spoke with a neighboring resident who has Starlink.  He said you pay more but it is quality internet.  That’s the route I’m taking.  Two of the three contracted employees from AT&T said they are not from the United States but live overseas.  So AT&T doesn’t even employ US residents but pays foreigners instead.This company is total crap!Rod WeberPensacola, Florida",0

DONT FNG  BOTHER . your service sucks if you can not even give customers a call and not the day before at 4pm that now you  can not provide service due to your employees not wanting to work you will never again get me to get service from you this is the worst experience i ever got from any company in 43 years , on top of all this i called to ask for a supervisor been on hold now 45 minutes im DONE .",0
"AT&T used to be a good reliable company to deal with. Things have changed; they no longer honor their contracts at this time. We've had problems with our phone and were told a tech would check the line at 8:00 am this morning. No one ever arrived or contacted anyone. Called AT&T and was promised a tech would arrive by noon. No one ever arrived or contacted us. Called AT&T again; this time they said a tech would be here between 1:30 and 4:00 pm - never showed up or contacted anyone. AT&T is supposedly open between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm but it's clear no one is coming, especially since customer service reps have been instructed not to provide names of techs assigned to a job or provide any info on their supervisors. This is about avoiding accountability, and it's also taking jobs away from people who are actually willing and able to work, Filed with the FCC and about to file with the PUC, will probably leave a complaint on BBB's website so everyone can be made aware AT&T has become completely unreliable.",0
After 9 years I finally had to find something better. Between the constant nag for new equipment and services and pop up odd fees and the constant push for autopay and most of all the price for what you get in return is not worth it. The ONLY good thing is I Never had signal problems anyplace in the world which is why I stayed with them for so long but that's where the good part stops. Being switched to autopay when I specifically told them not to was a complete violation of trust. They have cost me time and money in bank overdrafts and other issues and the best they have is 3GB of data which is garbage by today's standards. Their home internet speeds are terrible and they have bandwidth caps and are one of the only companies that still has them. They are just not up with the state of technology and the prices are terrible. It was time for us to part ways,0

"I ordered AT&T Internet Air for business with static IPs, but the device they sent lacked the static IP information I needed. The saleswoman who sold me the service was unhelpful after making the sale, directing me to call the 800 customer support number instead. After making more than 20 calls, I finally found someone who could assist, but they told me to return the device and suggested I call back to cancel the service. After returning the device, I made another 5 more calls before finally reaching the right person to cancel the account. From the time I ordered the service to the time it was canceled, I spent two months, made over 20 calls, wasted more than 10 hours on the phone, and made several trips to AT&T stores. Throughout this ordeal, I was repeatedly transferred to the wrong departments and even hung up on multiple times.AT&T's customer support is chaotic and frustrating. Their representatives are often rude, and the system is disorganized. There are separate departments for residential and business accounts, each offering different services—like phone, TV, fiber internet, U-verse internet, and Internet Air. Each department has its own customer service team, and they can't handle issues outside their specific area. Additionally, AT&T does not provide a clear phone number for specific problems. The general customer service number, 800-331-0500, often leads to dead ends, depending on the representative's knowledge.",0
"Sold at Costco, was told by ATT Retail that the Costco ""contractors"" were a scam, increased plan cost, botched transfer from Xfinity in the retail store (assigned phone number to an apple watch), other botched transfer issues, cancelled service after 4 days (""buyer's remorse"") and in took 25 hours of phone calls (plus one hour waiting for a store manager to leave and go to lunch only to have him tell me to call ""Customer Retention"") over five months to stop getting billed for services. I was supposed to get almost $800 in credits but only got $540 (approximately) of them processed. Multiple promises that they would provide credits and correspondence.  I think my experience with them is over, after the put me in collections for $38.77 because I told my credit card company to stop paying their bills (after not having their services for several months).  They charge the $38.77 for my autopay being rejected!  I finally paid the $38.77 because it was less ""costly"" than spending another two hours on hold and with ATT Biling rep tell me that his manager had to call me back withing 48 hours!",0

"It's hard to imagine how an American company could offer worse service or make dealing with them more difficult. When the TV box for the main TV went out, it took well over an hour to reach a person on the phone. They sent a reprocessed replacement box; it arrived quickly and worked well for 3 days and then quit. Another 34 minutes on the phone, this time while I drove, and then they said they can't replace the box they sent a few days ago until I read them the number on the bottom of the box. I explained I didn't have the number with me, and it would mean I'd have to call back tomorrow, spending another 30-60 minutes on the phone and delaying TV service another day; I asked if they don't have the number since they just sent the box. They had no interest in helping. They value their time by keeping you forever on hold, but they have no respect for yours. Can't get away from them fast enough!",0
"I am incredibly disappointed with the abysmal customer service from AT&T Fiber. After being a loyal customer with an account in good standing for years, I encountered a situation where my credit card had to be replaced due to fraudulent activity. This caused a slight delay in payment—completely out of my control. Despite explaining the situation to their customer service, I was hit with a one-time late fee.You would think that after years of reliable payments, AT&T would show some flexibility or basic human understanding. But instead, their customer service was rude, dismissive, and completely unwilling to help. They refused to reverse the fee, even though I explained that the delay was due to a situation involving fraud, something I had no control over.Rather than appreciate a long-time customer or even show empathy for an obvious and honest mistake, AT&T treated me like just another number. The customer service reps were condescending, cold, and seemed more interested in enforcing rigid policies than providing any actual service. This level of treatment is shocking, especially from a company that claims to care about its customers.If AT&T Fiber is willing to treat loyal, long-standing customers this poorly, I can only imagine the experience for everyone else. They clearly value squeezing a few extra dollars over treating people fairly or maintaining customer relationships. Stay far away if you expect any decency or customer care.",0

"AT&T is the worst phone company I've ever dealt with. I bought a new phone in May but was given a refurbished or used because it came with no plastic on it and it didn't even have a box when the guy walked out he had to go in the back and get a box. The phone was defective, I went to the AT&T the day after I bought the phone, the guy did nothing so I called at&t. After 3 months of resetting the phone a new sim then a wireless sim, they finally filed the warranty claim to send me another phone. I pay insurance every month. They sent me a phone with no box, no stylist, and the phone was in no way protected. They sent it in a thin piece of plastic with paper around it, in a box that was seven times the size of the phone. So the post office does not handle things with care which means the phone was bounced around the whole trip until it got to me. Now the chances of this phone having something wrong with it is very high. I called AT&T and three different supervisors told me that it was a refurbished phone that it's in the warranty and I signed the contract the green to that. But yes from day one they charge me for a brand new phone. Now I talked to another supervisor named Brooke today and she told me no it's not refurbished it was never used. So AT&T continues to lie, each agent I spoke to, most of them supervisors, each say something different. AT&T is sneaky, deceiving, and complete Liars. Brooke the supervisor talk to me terribly insulted me and then told me that I was being hostile. Because she decided to keep talking over me. When I first started talking she must have muted me or was doing something else because it took her 31 seconds to respond to me when I stopped talking. That's not normal. When I got the phone in the store the man was well aware that I was videoing the interaction because of previous issues with AT&T. Now that I have proof that AT&T store gave me a used phone with no box, and AT&T deciding to send me a refurbished phone, I'll be pursuing other actions. If you want to deal with Liars, and sneaky people, go ahead and get service through at&t. Otherwise I would go to Verizon.",0
"I broke my old phone and needed a new one before moving abroad to Spain for a year. AT&T told me and it was IMPOSSIBLE to buy a phone ANYWHERE with the carrier unlocked. A flat out LIE, you can buy one at the apple store easily. Now, not only will they refuse to unlock my new phone for me so I can get a Spanish phone number, they have avoided my calls, AND lied to me several times saying that they did unlock it when they actually didn’t. Additionally, I have continually received people on the phone that have no idea what they are talking about and it is clear that in many cases, I know more about this issue than them. Not only is the international plan that I am currently relying on costing me $10/day, but my safety is at risk here due to a lack of ability to communicate with the directors of my study abroad program and my host family.",0
"AT&T service is the worst internet provider on the planet. My internet cable was cut Sept 6 at 9 AM. The earliest appointment was Sept 9 between 8 - 12 so I confirmed it. They did not show! I received text updates saying they are running late but never showed. I called twice for a status and was put on hold for 43 minutes the first time and 64 minutes the second time. They finally told me that due to the AT&T strike they did not assign my ticket to a technician and there was none available. But At 7 PM an AT&T technician arrived at the house directly across the street for a repair but he refused to fix my cable because my work ticket was not assigned to him and the customer service rep cannot assign a work ticket. There is a huge disconnect between the customer service department, the dispatcher and the technician. They are very inefficient and I the customer got screwed.Thank you AT&T… Your FIRED!",0

And he was still a very healthy boy. People , they don't care about you,  your property,  your pets, your service animals etc and they should have to pay. PERIOD! I AM A LUNG TRANSPLANT NEEDED PATIENT AND I NEEDED HIM. I would be open to contact from attorneys. 12106 Raven South Dr. CYPRESS, TX 77429",0
Went from prepaid to postpaid and can't pay my bill thru Myatt cuz it is in my prepaid number. Have spent over 30 days trying to resolve the issues and no help. I am now responsible for a $600 phone that I can't get any info on because of my prepaid account. No wonder At&t now has a class action lawsuit against them which I will be joining,0
"If I could give a zero I would. Being on the phone for 28 minutes, the guy had no clue how to revamp an iPhone and then hung up on me.  Needed better service and he sat there masterbating.",0
Whatever you do never switch over from your carrier! I recently switched over the biggest mistake of my life and I get constant call drops and no service. If you’re traveling overseas FORGET ABOUT HAVING SERVICE WITH THEIR 10/day plan! It is a scam they want to switch you over and then hold you accountable for 3 years of responsibility with phone! (I brought over iPhone 15s and the credit is applied in the span of 3 years to my bill),0
"I have used att for a few years now, and recently had a problem on my iPhone 13.I contacted them and said they would send someone out immediately, as it was under warranty.Now two months later, I am being charged $250.00 for their service.  A fee was never mentioned, until I received this invoice notification.I have nothing good to say about ATT, and  their warranty or service. I will be dropping them, as soon as possible.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER USE ATT FOR YOUR SERVICE.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY REGRET IT.Terry",0
"AT&T has been my provider for internet, Uverse TV & mobile phone service…the internet 5G fails daily & does not work so WiFi is not operational…customer service is very hard to reach…have been struggling to reach customer service for more than 5 weeks for this recurring problem…will look to another vendor as going without WiFi on a daily basis is an expensive waste of funds without working products as described in my agreement.  :(",0
"Att technicians are some of the laziest people on the planet. Never get att if you want real customer service. I speak for an entire neighborhood out in travelers rest sc, we’ve been without wifi for a month and they refuse to come out and fix the lines",0
"I’ve never left a review in my life but after being on the phone with AT&T for 70ish hours In 2 months over the same issue THAT ATT CAUSED I feel like I need to leave a review for the rest of the world to know!ATT has blacklisted my son’s phone bc of their screw up and my son has been without a phone for two months and no one seems to have enough sense to fix it. I have been with ATT for 25 plus years and have 8 lines, home internet, 4 I pads, 2 watches and my whole business is on ATT and I still can’t get anything done. I’m currently on the phone with att on hold and have been for two hours which is why I have plenty of time to write this review. If anyone is looking into getting anything ATT please do yourself a favor and reconsider. I’m to the point I would rather send smoke signals then give this dump another penny of my money!Scott WUpdate: so after two insurance claims (250.00 each) i finally had to buy a new 1500.00 dollar phone and had to get my son a new number the problem is “fixed”! 2,000.00 dollars later my sons phone works bc they couldn’t fix what they screwed up.",0

I was with ATT for many years both my business account and personal account.  I recently switched companies due to a better packaged deal.  I transferred the business account and cancelled the personal.  After paying off phones and paying the final bill I have been unable to get my IPhones unlocked.   They send me to website which sends me to customer care which sends me back to the website.  This has been going on for months.  I ask to speak to a supervisor and was told no one can help me.  They are holding my phones hostage for no reason.,0
"I moved away from ATT about 10 years ago, for some reason - my wife stayed with them for 18+ years.And all that loyalty got us what?Misled promises. Period.We were strolling down grocery store and ATT guy lured us into Fiber Optic Internet connection which is supposed to be 'WOW'.I never bought the hype but they promised its cheaper than what we were paying and since my wife has been wireless user - we get additional $20 discount + $300 gift card.What happens next:Gift card never arrived - so I called - and they are like - oh but you did not confirm that you wanted gift card. W.T.F.  Anyway - after 50 mins calls - they release the gift card.And when I asked about $20 credit for using wireless plan at the same address (which was the condition) - they said - it takes few months and the excess we paid will be refunded and the discounted rates will apply.I check in every 3 months  or so and after a total of 9 months - they tell me - kid you not - I have chat transcripts, that plan is no longer available.W.T.F.ATT signs up customers who want to save money luring them into false promises and then after they are stuck with ATT - they tell you ""that plan is no longer available"".I am not surprised by this behavior because this was the reason I moved out of ATT network.  But due to changes in employment and to save few bucks - I 'believed' them again to be misled yet again.ATT wireless service in our area is patchy too...I have had ZERO drop calls in years in this area but with ATT service - that's no problem - we have miles of 'patchy service'.ATT continues its legacy...at least they are consistent in screwing people of their hard earned money.Time to look for another service I guess.",0
"Horrendous experience with Fleet Complete. They lied about contract structure, saying no prepayment penalty if I paid for the device but then still included prepayment in contract if I ended it prior to 3 years. But 1 year in, devices stopped working. Very cheaply made. I tried cancelling, but they made me file a support ticket first. Support could not diagnose the issue, so I tried cancelling again. But I could not cancel with an open support ticket for some reason (likely just to prevent cancellations). Any time I call, I get transferred to different departments until I am eventually disconnected. I have spent hours and hours with support trying to cancel these devices because I hate still giving them money. We have work ipads on this account or else I would cancel the credit card. To this day, I have devices that I cannot cancel even though they haven't worked for years. Absolute thievery.",0
"Honestly, I completely regret switching from T-mobile to AT&T. I made the mistake of switching my whole family from T-mobile to AT&T after being approached by an employee in a Target by my house. He promised things would be cheaper, we could all upgrade our phones, etc- I fell into wanting the newest iPhone I guess. So we all switched over in July of 2023 and let me tell you- don't freaking to do it. We have had more issues with our phone service through ATT this year than we EVER had with T-mobile, and we were with T-mobile for over 10 years. From calls just straight up not going through for NO reason, terrible coverage compared to T-mobile, the constant outages and privacy breaches UGH. I'm so mad at myself for switching over. I can't tell you how many times I've not been able to do the simplest things like pulling up directions or something just to not be able to do it because of an outage or poor service. NEVER happened with T-mobile. Also got talked into adding another line and getting another iPhone, bringing my husband onto our plan- ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE! I was straight up LIED TO by the representative regarding the price increase on our bill- and when I called customer service to complain and see what we could do- the woman I spoke with literally said ""I don't know what you want me to do"" and ""so what are you going to do?"" MA'AM you are in customer service, fix the freaking problem!! It's not MY job to solve these issues. It's yours?! Anyway. Worst company and service ever. If you're thinking about switching over don't do it. Oh also we had internet service through them and we moved, they don't service our area so I cancelled, and then was called by them to ask why I cancelled and how they could get me back (LOL)- I told them they don't service the place where I'm moving and they double checked (waste of my time) only to tell me oh yeah no we don't. Then kept freaking calling me and emailing me like WE MISS YOU PLEASE COME BACK TO YOUR INTERNET PLAN. Like come on, communicate w each other and leave me the heck alone. Funny how they don't want to help when you have issues but when they want to sell you something you can't get rid of them. Anyway- I guess this has been built up for some time but again came up today as I tried to return my mom's phone call only for it not to go through THREE TIMES. No voicemail or anything. Just a message saying that this number can't take calls right now. HELLO? But she got my texts just fine. WILD. You are the worst ATT :) ALSO sorry last thing! I would cancel and leave them in the dust but absolutely don't want to put my family through switching plans and phones and everything again. It was such an annoying process that I regret putting them through once, I don't want to do that to them again! k bye",0
Been in the Unlimited & More Plan for years 2018. Over the past three year AT&T  has increased my bill $15-20 each year since they no longer offer that plan. They keep trying to get me to switch off this grandfathered plan so I will lose my HBO MAX for life plan. Every time I call in for the increased rate I’m told the same thing. It seems they’re trying to bully me off the old plan by increasing the rates each year. How is this right. The customer service representatives are rude and usually hang up and are no help.,0
"They are the worst company I really want to suit them please someone let me know how can I do it , is too much , how come the government let this company still money from customers like this .",0
"Each month, they have an extra charge for something that makes no sense.If you complain, they will say it is in policy, which means they created a fake policy to make the charge valid!!Very unpolite customer service.I lost my cases to my online account. It has been over two months, and they still say it is a technical issue we are working on.If you call overseas from WhatsApp, they still charge you.The rate is 0.terrible company.",0
"Ive had to make so many more calls, im just talking about 1 specific day here, but i made 3 calls and had to just hang uo was so frustrating. And on the 4th call the lady was finally willing to help me about my POOR service and she ended up sending me something and after that my service was good. I asked if it would stay like that she said yes of course. But then the next month, i told them prior i needed to change day i can pay to my pay day, and so after these calls and fixing my service i got charged on the 3rd or 4th so i called about it and asked why so early we agreed on the 14th she said oh that starts next month. So considering i paid that month i thought ""ok i paid this month and the day i pay changes next month"" but no i guess i had to pay for something they probably made up and the same month on the 14th it tried charging me again. At that point i obviously didnt save enough thinking i paid that month. Now after missing that payment my service is even worse then it was at the start. They have great service, but not willing to share it",0
Att &t is either the worst company or has literally never re invested the billions they make back into technology.  Either way the service is terrible and you can never get a hold of anyone unless your service plan is up then they never stop bothering you. Wish I had an option but apparently they have paid people off in my area as it is the only option for cable services.,0
"This was a while ago. ATT bought out by Indian scammers.I have ATT prepaid. Their regular service had a deal on 3 lines for my family. I told my mom and she bought it, and she mentioned they asked for her SSN, which she thought was weird. I had a bad feeling.Not two months later she got a credit alert, someone opened up a credit card in FL. No one in the family has ever been! Thank god she shut that down.I walked in store and talked to a manager, he said call up their phone reps, regular ATT has different reps from ATT Prepaid. OMG all from India! And I pretended to buy a line from them and they also asked my SSN!Classic America, bought out by Indian scammers. I can't believe it, but it makes sense these days. NEVER GIVE YOUR SSN!!! Why would a phone company need that??",0
Service is trash and the representatives are useless will never use them again,0
"I have been with ATT for quite a while. I would say that their customer service has gotten so bad that not only you have to wait for more than 30 minutes to get a live agent, but also get ridiculously overcharged. I am HATING AT&T post paid service. Before switching over to post paid, I had prepaid and life was so much easier- No surprise charges, no headaches. Whenever I call AT&T about extra charges, the answer I get is that my next bill is going to be lower. But, when I see my next bill, it is higher.😬 Their agents are LIERS. If you want to get a heart attack, signup for AT&T’s post-paid service.",0
Horrible  service and customer support !!!,0
"Big mistake on my part switching from T-Mobile to ATT. Since then, in order to connect my phones properly I must have spent 20 to 30 actual hours on the phone with various assistants from all over the world, in which ""most"" of them are very hard to understand, and seem to pull out an answer from a cheat sheet in front of them. 10 months later I'm still having issues.I now just called because I received a special offer for current customers that have Fiber optic Internet service, and they are telling me that the special offer does not apply to me. But when I read the offer thru the email they have sent me it clearly said for current customers upgrading to 1 Gig. with no other services needed.Apparently I don't know how to read! What has become to our wonderful old Country. Going downhill fast. I can't for the services to end so I can ditch ATT for good.",0
This is the worst service I've ever had my bill is so high they take money out of my account w/o me authorizing the payment then turn my service off and tell me I need 175$ more y'all can count y'all days I will be leaving at&t and leaving bad reviews every day.,0
"Absolute worst customer service ever. I have spent hours on the phone with them, I have been transferred to multiple Indians, Pakistanis, and god knows what other nationalities to no avail. I am done dealing with those cretins and I will take my business somewhere else. I have been with them for over 10 years. I guess they really do not care for their customers. They convinced me to change my old service with the new Internet Air. Well, it does not work. They also refuse to send tech to install it because they say it is child play. Now they will not take back their new machine that does not work, while disconnecting my old one that was working just fine. I am left with no internet, and zero help from ATT. But I bet they will keep sending me bills. Oh well, Spectrum Internet, here I come. You just gained a new customer by default.",0
The absolute worst customer service and telecommunications Co. EVER. Too long for me to write here.,0
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER and BILL INCREASED DRASTICALLY with no explanation. I called Customer Service to sit on hold for 17 minutes and then ""try"" and speak with the person who could barely speak English.  I was trying to resolve an issue from the previous month when I called and was told it was ""all fixed now.""  SURPRISE, still messed up.  All these representatives do is keep saying ""please hold,"" ""I am sorry about your experience but rest assured I will assist you,""  and when you tell them that the information you were provided the last time you called and they are now saying ""I am sorry that is  wrong but I will assist you,"" and you get completely different information.  I have been with AT&T for over 10 years and the past couple of years their customer service is AWFUL!!!!!   Can't speak English clearly to understand, have NO IDEA what they are saying and information they are providing, and everyone tells you something different!!  My elderly parents and my aunt are also with AT&T and unfortunately I have tried to assist both of them the past few weeks and also had horrible experiences (not to mention the phone calls both lasted over an hour and a half)!    I have already switched to Verizon (as of yesterday) and I will be assisting my parents and aunt leave AT&T this weekend.  Hard to believe that about 5 years ago I actually wrote another review for AT&T giving them 5 stars and talking about how they were one of the ""few companies left who still truly believed in good customer service; and although the outcome of my conversation wasn't exactly what I hoped for, the customer service representative was polite, knowledgeable, and took the time to explain everything to me.""  What happened AT&T?????",0
Not signal at all even in open parking lot.,0
The worst worst service that I've ever had that I don't have they can't get it right they keep milling me for something that already straightened out when I finally got to talk to American English they sent me another one the lady I talk to you says they don't keep history of the last calls which I know they do I don't owe them anything I haven't had AT&t in 3 months,0
Terrible customer support. I just wanted to see our bills from more than 16 months ago but they refused. The representative said if I wanted to see them they would charge me $5 per month for each bill and then hung up on me. The service gets worse and worse and the bills go up and up. Our family is switching to Verizon.,0
"I hate ATT with a passion at this point 2.5 hrs of run around for arbitrary account access... kudos, I now am willing to buy out and switch carriers... hope your stock plummets when MIT realizes that this is the network of morons...",0
This is YET AGAIN another company that CONSTANTLY attempts to try to overcharge you & come up with CONSTANT crap micro-charges... with a 1.3 rating... they are DAMN LUCKY to be getting any money at all!,0
Dipshit morons...  kept me on hold for over an hour... patience has worn very thin... switching to new carrier bs...,0
The worst experience I ever had !!!! Been on the phone 2 freaking hours just to get my internet situated !! Do not recommend,0
I made an internet with them recently and it's been a month sense that and no one came to install it and they never responded back and they blocked my phone number so I'm going to leave your scam asses out I always hated them I was just stupid enough to get back with you guys,0
"How bad can customer service be before you have to believe they are doing this on purpose? ATT's customer service is so bad that it is not just my desire to never use their product again but I also want to get 10 other people not to use their product. This is the same way I felt about Sears and Kmart before they took their plunge to nothing. I have spent 25 days now trying to get 10 phones ""unlocked"", I got 8 done but the last two have been held for any reason they can think of! It has taken so long that one of the reasons is that we nit another billing cycle and the two phones that have not been released now have a higher monthly service fee and they still won't release. I shut the service off so that they did not get rewarded for delaying, but that has not helped. ATT sucks.",0
"After about 2 hours on the phone trying to verify the account that we have had for 30 years, I spent another half hour being told that after we got a new fiber optic line ATT will not come and get rid of the old copper lines running from the pole to the house. They said that we would have to hire an outside contractor to do that sort of thing.",0
"HORRIBLE. Yeah they CAN have great service, only if they let you. Which isnt all that likely",0
we called in on the 27th and was informed we needed to call the loyality dept to make payment arrangments she gave us the number . called it right away and kept getting a message saying that number doesnt work in our area code. so the 28th i called again and spent another 1 1/2 hours on the phone with this guy and we made the payments arrangements for the 18th of september and 30 days later for the balance. he said the payment was approved and i didnt need to do anything else. we are good to go. i woke up this morning 9/4/24 and seen our cameras were offline and i looked at our equipment that uses hotspots and seen they were also all offline so i called my wifes phone and message comes up that we are suspended. after 30 minutes i get to the loyality dept and she says that the guy never finialized the payment arrangement that we put in place and was told it was approved and we no longer qualify to do payments. it is a holiday week we are already money short and now we dont have enough money to pay payroll i told her. she said nothing she can do and i started in on my rantt and the line went silent. they put us on hold and hung up on us.  we made the arrangments and they didnt follow thru with them and now we have to pay the price. wont beable to pay payroll this week. thanks at&t you are the best. we are going to see if we can get all of our lines opened up and see about swithcing to another company,0
"AT&T definitely has a customer service issue.  I notified AT&T before I moved out of my apartment to have service cancelled.  They told me at the time that I had to turn in the modem.  I told them at that time, and several times after that, that I didn't have a modem. I told them there was a big built in box with a door in my closet and that the modem must be built in.  I had always lived in a house and knew where my modem was located. I talked to them several times before I moved about the modem, and no one ever told me that the modem was in the box.  I found out from apartment management that there was indeed a modem in the box, but this was after I moved 6 hours away.  I explained the situation to AT&T and asked if someone could pick it up, and they said no.  People are moving in and out of the huge apartment complex all the time and most use AT&T, so someone could have picked the modem up.  Now three months later, they say I owe $150, didn't offer me a way to pay in installments, and turned it over to collections.  One of those times I spoke to them before I moved 6 hrs. away, someone should have told me where the modem was located.  They just don't care!",0
"Overall bill has gone up $40 in the last year with no discernible change in service. Called “customer service” to ask why and was on the phone for 40 minutes with a rep who was clueless, barely spoke English, and eventually hung up on me. Choose another provider if you can.",0
AT&T uverse TV and AT&T in general is exhibit a of how to rip off customers with poor product quality and zero customer service. This company has been in decline for 20 years. It's demise is imminent.  They are self destructing,0
"Prices are ridiculous for the services and I would never ever recommend anyone to them. I was warned by so many but wanted have my own experience and now I have and I can tell you, it was a horrible mistake. I hate Spectrum but will deal with them before I deal with AT&T again. Customer service is terrible and not knowledgeable of how they can help you. I was hospitalized for a little under a month and I reached out to let them know I was really sick and needed surgery. They told me how much I needed to pay to square up my account and just get it paid when I could and that everything would be fine once I paid the amount which was over $300. I checked my system after getting better and ready to go back home in which I work from home to only find out they turned off all my services because they said I didn’t communicate with them and make arrangements to pay. I cancelled everything to NEVER return. Unfortunately, google fiber isn’t in my area yet so Spectrum won me back and can do a quick turnaround. If you’re on the fence about AT&T for any services, Don’t do it! Take it from me! I’ve give them the benefit of doubt on all services but it ended badly for me and so many others. You have been warned. 😝",0
"After almost 20 years of being a customer, I requested a one time exception to make a payment arrangement and was told “my account doesn’t qualify”. This occurred after being told I’ve never had any returned payments or other issues. No one was willing to assist and chalked it up to a random system selection that determines who can get an exception and who cannot. Additionally, Jose Z., a manager, was rude, unprofessional, misleading and hung up on me when I pointed out discrepancies in what he relayed to me. A company who has had so many issues and instability with protecting customer information should be more concerned and customer friendly. It’s time to change carriers!",0
"Le pongo 1 porque no hay 0.Mas de una hora en hold en el teléfono, oyendo musica y propagandas estupidas, que dicen que pida mas información el agente que no contesta.I give it a 1 because there is no 0.More than an hour on hold on the phone, listening to music and stupid commercials, telling me to ask for more information from the agent who doesn't answer.",0
"They’re the worst . I’ve been a longtime loyal internet customer of AT&T . Plus , I’m a senior . My monthly promo price of $56.00 for  stand alone internet was increased , so I contacted AT&T to see what kind of discount they could offer  me bc they increased my monthly rate to $71.00 month . Joyce gave me a new monthly price of $61.00 month . This was a discount of $10.00 per month as like my previous 12 month price . Well , I get my new bill for Sept & they’re billing me for $71.00 per month ( no discount ) . I just called customer service & spoke to ARAH . She said there is no monthly discount of $10.00 & my monthly cost is the $71.00 & they would not adjust my monthly bill to the $61.00 per month that I was quoted / agreed upon with Joyce . They will not honor the price given to me by their representative that I spoke with on July 24th . Really , AT&T ?!  I just want people to be aware of their horrible customer service practices & that they do not honor their monthly prices given  ! How do they get away with that ? Plus ,they seem to slow speed down at night . This has been an issue with them in the past , too . I would not recommend them . Beware !",0
They are slow and have no idea what they’re doing. They are also expensive,0
I went to make a payment arrangement through the app. The app froze so I closed it and re opened it. When I did it showed zero balance owed. It took the money without an authentication from me. Ended up paying my rent a week late. Soon as my phone contract is up I'm finished with AT&T. I know calling customer service is a waste of time. 15 years with AT&T. They have fallen so far.,0
"I wish there was an option to give zero stars. I've spent the last few business days trying to cancel my service. It won't allow me to do it online. Getting anything accomplished with their customer service is equivalent to trying to win the mega millions. If you can make it through the labyrinth of options, and actually speak to a human, your experience gets even worse. I've been transferred multiple times since apparently nobody wants to do their job. Ive had the calls magically disconnected more times than I can count. I've opted for the call back option which is their way of telling you, ""we aren't ever going to call."" The store told me they can't cancel services, and that I have to call the number. Is it seriously impossible to get rid of this service? This is beyond unacceptable. I was never rude or discourteous to anyone I spoke to. I chose the correct options during the automated section. They had zero reason to disregard me for days at a time. I'm not sure what else to do to get my service removed. I will never use their services again. Mostly because I think it's going to be impossible to get rid of them in the first place. I'll get a new bank card so they can't take anymore of my money. Bet they won't have any problem suspending or cancelling my service then. Bet I won't have any issues getting anyone on the phone telling me I owe them money. That sector of their call service works perfectly. Do I need to get legal services to get this cancelled, or can someone just push a few buttons on a keyboard and get this taken care of?",0
"Run AWAY from AT + T. Seriously. I was with T-Mobile for 10+ years. I adored them. The only reason I even entertained At+T is T Mobile had an ongoing tech issue to upgrade my iPhone for over a year (I left the country and came back and tried again). I STRESSED to AT+T how important my international service was. The rep in FL told me it would function no problem with roaming like Tmobile. WRONG. As soon as I left the country, I started getting notes about $12 DAILY Charges. What? I messaged At + T - they closed the ticket with NO REPLY. I called internationally and STAYED on hold for 45 min with NO answer. I received a bill for DOUBLE + NO credits from what they promised on promotions yet. I have now filed TWO BBB claims to REFUND all and implement again their ATT Passport (I researched and found out they STOPPED the monthly passport in 2024) WHAT? in our global economy? Their presidents office CALLED me (I am in Bali) repeatedly at 3 am (I saw missed calls in morning). They refused to answer my 5 questions via email or leave a professional voice mail DETAILING all on ensuring my phone is optimized. I have no choice when I travel but to keep my phone in Airplane mode unless connected in WIFI. This is worse than 2000. I filed a FTC suit as well. I found out they have multiple ones. As soon as I am back in USA I am running back to TMOBILE.",0
"literally had the worst experience and no help whatsoever from att regarding my phone screen and insurance claim. no one could verify my account and the chat agents kept giving me the same run around with no solution. they ended up telling me to go to a store. how inconvenient knowing that not everyone is mobile enough to pick up and go nor does everyone have the ability to drive themselves. completely insensitive to those with physical disabilities.  All the stores around me as well close at 6pm... yeah real clever timing so the store closes when people are getting off work. I pay over $200 in services a month from att and got no where with my issue and was just told to go to a store. save yourself time, money, and tears and switch to a different service while you still can.",0
they stole my 40.00 said my account was suspended .all I did was replace my phone they were no help setting it up told me to bring it in 45 miles away when I got there they said I had to set it up on line ---had to pay again get a new number--ass holes,0
Had att service and it was great then I moved. I was canceled on twice to come and have a tech connect my internet. 3 weeks later and no internet and no appointment was rescheduled but there is a bill due on a service that has not been provided.,0

"It's impossible to deal with AT&T! After 3 hours of calling, going to website, talking to representatives, I still couldn't pay my monthly bill. Why? Because they suddenly don't recognize my password that I ve been using for years! Also they don't recognize my pin, which I ve been using for years. In order to change my pin they ask for my password and visa versa. It's a vicious cycle. Reps are NOT HELPFUL WHATSOEVER!I have to go to AT&T store, try to solve this problem.

"I don’t know what has happened in the past 2 years, but it is total nonsense trying to get any type of customer service. IF you can get a real person, one person tells one thing yet another says the total opposite.  I spent 4 days trying to get a HUMAN with no avail until Friday and it was an absolute circus.The only reason I keep the phone plan is the coverage area. Otherwise I’d go right back to TMobile.",0
Definitely not a service you want when trying to get things resolved the customer service is horrible horrible horrible no one listen! You will get passed from one representative to the next I have had them for over 9 years and I’m now in search for a new provider,0
Just spent an hour trying to update my cell phone address on line and couldn’t figure out how to do so so I gave up. Called AT&T only to spend 25 minutes with the rep who finally changing my address. Then spend over an hour trying to have the rep (who had NO clue) explain how I could do this myself and was TOTALLY confused with his explanation so I asked for a supervisor. Was Hung up on thee times by the rep (who called back) while waiting over 45 minutes which felt like a delay tactic. Never spoke with ANY supervisor and never got another call back on the last hang up,0
"Manager at the Longview, Washington store treats the employees poorly with great disrespect.  Also, the iPad I purchased didn’t work, the techs tried to resolve and they charged me a restocking fee because I had to return it.  I would have kept the iPad if it would be operational but is worthless if it won’t work.   They shouldn’t charge you restocking fees on defective merchandise.",0
"AT&T customer service is difficult to reach.  Hold times around an hour.  I left Tracfone because questions could not be addressed. Now I'm paying for 3 phones by contract with AT&T, and STILL do not have access to customer service when their is a malfunction or I have a question.",0
"Did an online purchase with a 40.99 quote for 4 new lines. They canceled order said go to store for id verification. I did so in store the plan was 60.99 but he added auto pay and paperless for another 10 dollars off. But i have to wait 2 to 3 billing cycles when online it was immediate then i kept being told basically, I can't read i am lying and I am just looking for aa discount that the only other discount is military teacher etc. but yet it clearly says this on the quote AT&T Unlimited Premium® PL planSee discounts$40.99OFFER: Get $10.00/mo. in bill credits for up to 36 mos. when you add a new line, bring your own smartphone, and transfer your existing number. Plus, we'll waive your activation fee. NOTE Discount not reflected in cart.",0
"Do not trust anything they text or email you.  It is most likely incorrect. AMEX could not explain what they are up to.  Their website is very poorly designed with broken links, and it is unable to ask appropriate questions to get you to correct person for the reason you are calling about.  In addition to having their system go down several times lately, their web site is awful.  They need an AI to straighten it out.   Very disappointing.",0
"0 stars - If I could I would rank ATT&T 0 stars, but I had to give them a 1 to get to this point.  Our experience has been horrific and began in January, 2024.  Issues are still not resolved and it is August 31, 2024. We set up a plan with ATT and purchased a motorola phone which the store rep recommended to us.  It was one of those new screens you are supposed to be able to bend and it broke with in the 3 day window.  They would not take the phone back.  Instead they sent it to Motorola.  Motorola replaced it with a refurbished phone, but it took 3 weeks!!  The screen stopped working again in late July.  We have been trying to cancel our ATT service since then but keep getting the run-a-round.  It is like they are holding us hostage!  I am trying today to cancel.  Again, run around, waiting for a call back.  Better business bureau here we come!!  Oh agents are rude and don't know much just pass you here and there.  Verizon is awesome and has awesome service, but spendy.  T-Mobile is where we landed - the customer service is outstanding.  Not quite the coverage of Verizon, but good enough for the price.  AT&T is a ripoff and customer service is horrid!",0
Called for info.Agent wanted personal info before answering question.Not happening.,0
If I could give them zero stars I would. I reluctantly switched over to AT&T for a “cheaper” bill. I ended up with 3 phones on two separate accounts due to the desperation of one of the agents trying to sell me a phone. She messed up my accounts and I was left to be responsible to pay for activation fees and the middle of the month billing fees due to finally merging the accounts. After trying to reconcile this issue for weeks. The customer service agents are rude. The wait times are long as hell. I never called Verizon and had to be switched to a million departments or experienced super wait long times. I am currently on hold with AT&T on two different phones. I have been on the call with different agents since 10 am and it’s now 2:17pm as I am writing this review. I never write reviews but this has been the worst experience ever. Please avoid going with this telephone service no matter how cheaper it may look it’s all a LIE!Update: I am still on the phone with the agents due to multiple accounts created by these inexperienced agents. Who in turn can’t fix your issue because it’s not their department just for them to transfer me multiple times and guess what your on hold for an hour. I wish I could screenshot these calls today. It’s currently 5:19 pm AT&T has taken my entire Saturday away! & guess what? I still have yet to get my issues resolved. This has been a total nightmare.,0
"The director of phone support should be arrested and deported. The goal of ATT phone support is to keep you on hold until to give up. After the minimal hour wait, you will speak to an agent that will need to transfer you to anoth agent. Another hour wait. Then an agent will tell you that they fixed the problem but they didn't. Days or weeks later you will start the whole process over. Stay away from ATT. Every other phome service has better support.",0
4 hours of my day on hold with ATT today about a downed line in my yard after a recent storm. You know how far I got? BEING TOLD TO GO TO A LOCAL STORE TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!!!! are you kidding me??,0
Terrible Hold Time Even To Pay a Bill u have to wait 1 hour for and agent and the worse collection company also they use,0
I signed up for AT&T fiber and made an appointment took the day off to be here!! No show !! Rescheduled for another day took day off from work and what another  NO SHOW!! At this point I would pay more for internet service from someone else than give this Criminal Organization another chance !! If I could give them less than 1 ⭐️ I would definitely give them 0 ⭐️..I see why their workers are on strike they don’t want to work for them  either !!!! Hope they stay on strike !!,0
I would use a walkie talkie before going with AT&T again. Expensive and service is awful. They want to charge late fees but will not send me my bill. I have to go looking for it.,0
"I just ported in my number from t-mobile 7/27, to At&t. I was informed my bill was $46 dollars a month, with all my discounts, by two different agents. The date is now 8/30, and the charge for the bill that needs to be paid on 9/14 is $166. My activation fee was waived, I have an internet bundle, I have a union discount, and other fees were waived for porting in my number. I was warned not to switch to AT&T for this exact reason. But the experience so far since switching is worse than I was told. They have horrible network of communication between stores, customer service and information in there database. You will get a different answer every time you talk to some one new. AT&T, is easily the worst service provider I have ever had by far. And I have only had them a month. I will be switching back immediately!",0
The worse service the rudest agents and are far from treating it caring for their customers. I was a loyal customer for over 30 years and my service was suspended a week before my bill was due. My information was leaked 3 times and never received an apology or offered any kind of incentive to remain a customer. Couldn't login to .y account due to them wanting to verify using my phone number which was suspended and told by three agents sorry we cant helo you. Dont use att unless you like getting bent over,0
"Att made promises (Nick Schwartz) that if I signed up for phone and internet I would get a $20 discount on my bill. We'll after 6 months and 4 phone calls to him each month after the first two not being discounted he tells me I waited to long to contact him and now there's nothing he can do but I should call support and ask if there's anything they can do.  Called support and was told that promotion no longer exists but they can give me $15 off a month from that date forward and they would issue a (6/18/2024) $100 reward card to compensate me for the extra $120 charges on my past 6 bills. Meanwhile I also have a claimed $50 reward card supposedly in the works for my internet service rewards. Then received email that it was mailed july,4 2024. So today is 8/29/24 and I call to ask what is going on with the rewards cards supposedly being mailed and was told even though I never received $50 rewards card they would not issue a new one and that my $100 rewards card should be able to be claimed 8 weeks after approval and that that was still 2 weeks away.  Now my math skills are pretty decent so I replied 6/18 - 8/29 is around 10 weeks.  Then the person I was speaking with really tried to sales pitch me to upgrade my phone and add a line for $45 more a month. Needless to say I told her she was really missing me off now and I would start shopping for a new service provider for my phone and internet.",0
Worst company ever they quote you one thing over the phone and they just send you Higher Bill do not do auto pay beware.Stay away from them.,0
"On August 28th I went to the store in Gastonia on Cox road to find out if the phone I needed was available. As it was not, I went to the store on Myrtle School road in Gastonia. The representative, Jordan, was with other clients. I was not greeted. While still working with another client, Jordan asked me how she could help. I explained that I was looking specifically for Samsung s24 ultra with 512 GB of memory and came to her as it was unavailable at Cox road store. She informed me that she had two phones available at that location. I chose the color of the phone. She proceeded with the trade-in. As she was still working with both me and another person, I had to do all the installation on my new phone without her help. She did not go over any policies, protection plan options which she just added without asking me. When I got home and started setting up my phone I found out that she sold me a Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra with 256 GB. The next day I went back to the store. She said that she would not be able to replace the phone. She was not able to make a return either. I spent 3 and 1/2 hours at the store with her trying to help both me and another client at the same time again. I ended up leaving the store because she was not able to solve my issue and she sent me away. I had to go to the corporate store on Cox road where all my problems were solved by another representative without any issues. However I did have to still pay the restocking fee which I find unfair. On top of everything, Jordan was smelling strongly of marijuana, she was dressed yesterday in a mini skirt and today in jeans with multiple holes in them, something weird on her head, and looked completely unrepresentable and unprofessional. at one point I had to sit down because the smell of marijuana was that strong.",0
"WE HAVE BEEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR 2 DAYS WITH NO WAY OF FINDING OUT WHEN IT WILL BE BACK ON... THE APP IS TERRIBLE,  THE CALL CENTER IS EVEN WORSE .. WITH ALL THAT SAID THE INTERNET SERVICE IS THE SLOWEST IN THE AREA. SPECTRUM IS FASTER BUT UNRELIABLE.",0
"Keep your other services! I regret dropping Tmobile! My bill is never the same. It goes up and up. Also once direct tv merged with them forget it. I use to love direct TV but not anymore. I had my service suspended and it was turned on without any updated warning, no email no nothing. They charged me a whole month I never used. They refused to take it off and said there is no way to confirm I didn't use it. Like seriously do you not have access to see my usage. Basically insinuating I'm a liar!! Stay away! I regret it all the time!",0
Horrible Company!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!!,0
"Absolute WORST coverage and WORST service EVER!! AVOID AVOID AVOID!! Regrettably we believed the promises of superiority. LIES. It was ALL LIES! We were also told we had 90 days to drop if we weren't satisfied. Sure, they'll ""let"" you drop, but it will cost dearly. In the mean time we have ZERO cell service in the middle of the biggest business district in the state, with work that can't happen without constant phone use.",0

"Red Flag 🚩 I recently had an extremely unnerving experience with AT&T and its employees. It seemed to be an out of country call center for AT&T. My original reason for the phone call was to address an email I had received stating that my services were going to be suspended, even though I had made a payment arrangement for August 3, 2024. The representative said she saw the date and would adjust it for me. Immediately during a phone call she said she could potentially save me money. She said that my bill was $571 per month, and that she could reduce that down to $268 per month. She ended up selling me, four watches, and adding on an iPad, which the IPad I did not approve of, nor have I received. When I called back in to speak with another representative a day or two later, the gentleman said that it was a bad move and then I had screwed myself. He also said that he was going to send me a replacement for a phone that I had just recently lost that day earlier. That phone has since been canceled on someone’s end, but not mine. That employee said that I would be basically paying the same amount as I was paying previously, and that there would be no way that my bill would be $268. This is only one of many issues that I’ve had with your company over the past 10 years, and especially since you became linked to DIRECTV.I am requesting for an immediate review of my entire history, and that I am contacted by a senior representative who can make decisions for my account. As I have spent well over 100 hours at a bare minimum, *(including at least 2 full days on the phone for issues, which were days of employment for me)  being transferred to departments that are not correct, dealing with issues that never get dealt with, and also trying to get my account corrected.Here are some of the issuers I have experienced:-AT&T associates selling products without dealing with the original reason for call-Lying to consumers about cost and final pricing with little to no transparency-Over 100 hours easy on calls related to issues with accounts-$50 for screen replacement and told it had insurance and with new contract that was voided when I got the new iPad.-False advertising - As of May I have no more than 1 bar and/or no access to 5g. Calls are dropped and/or broken up constantly even with AT&T representatives on the call. Promised a cell booster by rep and when transferred to technician they said they had no info about it and denied it.-Deceptive and illicit business practices resulting in lost time, increased billing, and unaffordable services-Transfering my current plans to new ones when they want to sell new products, At least 3 new 2 year contracts on accounts recently.-Making arrangements without documenting or sending email confirmation, resulting in the account being suspended and the full bill being due to turn the accounts back on.-And the data breach has leaked my personal information to the dark web.I do not want to continue having these issues with your company. I would expect that this would be handled immediately, as I am limited on my time for reparations. I will also be forwarding this email to The Attorney Generals office and the FTC, along with other agency outlets if this is unattended. Please note that I have been a customer since well before Cingular wireless in the early 2000’s. I also own three businesses in Des Moines, Iowa, and partner with some of the largest businesses in our state. I hope this reaches the appropriate individuals, look forward to speedy response.This email was sent over two weeks ago. Since then, I have spoke with a store manager, who said they were going to take care of it. This manager refuses to keep contact with me or even give me an update. I have filed a complaint with the FCC, and forwarded emails on to every possible outlet I can find.",0
I'm a new customer just over the 30 day period.  A recent outage resulted is us not being able to access concert tickets on our phones. So we couldn't after tickets purchased.   After outage I still had phone issues that started prior to the outage unresolved.  I spent hours on the phone with multiple people.   Once resolved all that was offered was a 5.00 outage credit. Not even close to what I'm out for 2 concert tickets.  A manager still would not budge.  I will never recommend the service and when I transfer service I will not accept being charged for an unreliable service 😑.  I have never been treated so poorly.  Even reached out to our sales rep who was great upon the sale and kind at first.  Then tells me to change providers.  And he no longer works there.,0
I was so excited to switch from T-Mobil to AT&T and service is so disappointing.They are WAY worse than T-Mobil which I thought was hard to do.But upside they said I could buy $250 boost for my house:/ they could see my area is not good for AT&T once I called to complain.I live in a busy area with 85k people.They don’t have honest billing or at least up front about it. First bill $870Shocked.  But it would be worth it if I got service.   Would avoid if in Leander or Austin TX at all cost.,0
The worst CS EVER!! JUST GOT MY BILL TODAY AUG 28TH...DUE DATE SEPT 7TH....HOW WOULD THEY GET MY PAYMENT IN TIME VIA POSTAL SERVICE...THEY WOULD NOT...AND CHARGE ME LATE FEETHEY GET BREACHED...MY PASSCODE NOW DOES NOT EXIST....SPENT AN HOUR ON THE PHONE TODAY! Call dropped 2x and NO CALL BACK...3RD REP SAID COULD NOT TAKE PAYMENT INFO TODAY and apply to due date on Sept 7th IT WOULD BE TAKEN OUT TODAY...HORRIBLE  COMPANY...GOING TO DROP THEM,0

"AVOID Att at all costs.  Service was abominable. Paid for 50 mbs, got 20.  Cell service unavailable in parts of So. Calif.  When I tried to cancel they made it extremely difficult and ended up charging $188 after I cancelled, threatening to use a collection agency if I didn’t pay.  ATT appears to be losing customers at an enormous rate, and from my experience for good reason.",0
"Worst service ever spent hours on the phone trying to get my service on for data issues they were having, had my private information compromised, having phone issues the entire time, does not get service everywhere like it advertises 5g is better than Verizon, when my friend had Verizon in a no data zone her phone worked and Mines did not on 5G terrible. Will reach out to Morgan and Morgan.",0
"If I could put a negative mark I would. Do not recommend this company. Had issues with account, called over 8 times with same issue. Thought it was resolved. A year Later, they sent me to COLLECTIONS for fees I didn't owe!!!!!! Hate this company..",0
My husband and I went to an att store to setup a new plan with them. We both came from Verizon but on our parents plans. The transfer was not done correctly. The porting pins Verizon was not entered during the transfer. This resulted in us both losing our phone service in a few days of use. Mine happened first since I kept my old phone and husband stayed on his parents plan until it arrived. I spent three hours on phone with att and Verizon and my mom to get the porting pin. My husband is now going through this. This should not be this hard nor stressful. We are spending over $140 a month and not having any service. We are going to a cheaper service since att charges a lot for bad service.,0
"Bad bad experience bad bad customer serviceIs insane I don’t know cry or laugh!!!Get a promotional 50% Father’s Day and now charge me whole 100% so my advice is never never get a promotional from att, plus every month increase charges and you can try to call and call but nothing, now I try to go out of this nightmare!!!!",0
"At&t worst company for internet, I haven't had my internet for last 12 days in my business and their customer service can't tell you when they can restore the service.",0
I wish I could give a zero for this company. The worse company ever! Phones doesn’t works and they charge you a huge bill for a phone that won’t work at all! No connection or anything! Terrible terrible. I’m being charged $300 almost $400  for a bill that was supposed to be $110 a month,0
"Horrible service!! People try to contact me for days in and can't reach me. I call my wife, whom has  the same service as we have 4 different lines with this horrible company, and it will go straight to voice mail as I'm sitting next to her to see and try to understand what might be happening. But I've come to the conclusion this is a horrible company. I'll be leaving this awful service.",0
Anytime you need to talk to someone they transfer you around for an hour or 2. They don’t give any info to the person  you’re transferred to meaning you have to start over. Or they transfer you to the main customer service number where you also have to start over.,0
"AT&T is the worst company in the world. I joined the plan at Costco department store and imported my four lines from T-Mobile when the AT&T sales at Costco said that the deal is good for Costco executive members. Since I joined the plan the phons are not working. I am unable to text, call out or receive the call.when I call Costco VIP, it goes to South Africa, when I call in the USA, put me on hold over 2 hrs and the tech support is unable to solve the issues at all. I am very disappointed at AT &T service.",0

That didn't keep you from charging me another $60 because you told me you ""could turn it back on.""Come to find out, they cannot?!  Okay.I will work out of a cafe' for 2 weeks until I move and spend 10x the money for food/coffee out of GENERAL PRINCIPLE to keep my $$ out of the hands of ATT.Worst. Service. Ever.And on TOP OF THIS, they kept me on hold and just to be told this, i spent over 3.5 HOURS on the phone.NOPE. NEVER. AGAIN.",0
I have the Internet Air for Business I have had it under a month and It started out great then in a week it slowed down to with under a 1.0 Upload their tech support did 3 hours of over the phone work and I still had to go into the store because it was pinging in off of North and South Carolina and not Michigan towers.  Then I was told by service to get a new sim card in the store.  I was also told that they can cancel my other line which was a hotspot for business that did not work that I had to do it over the phone they did not have access; which the rep on the phone stated that I needed to go in store.  Moving onward I have been working this week when I got the new sim and the Internet Air went out again while working I called support I was on the phone 3.30 hours with 5 transfers and attitude from reps; when requesting a supervisor I was told they are already engaged and cannot take the call after an 1 hr of waiting for a supervisor I was transferred to another rude rep.  I hung up!  Then this morning I was experiencing the same speeds and I called I have been on the phone for another  3 hours and transferred 6 x with no resolution.  AT&T are beyond horrible and I do not recommend any Business internet service through them with the Internet AIR.,0
"Used to be a good service,  had then for years. Last year has been terrible. Can't reach anyone, lots of runaround and do not value my business. Had same SIM card for ten years and they want to charge me for a new one when it goes bad?. I'm prepaid for another few months and am then leaving. There are better plans with other providers, and customer service is a joke",0
"Horrible service and even worst customer service! On the phone for damn near 3 hours to add TWO LINES! What did Micheal the supervisor do, LIE! Talking about this would be easy yada ya.

I NEVER get my promo credit! They NEVER HAVE MY BILL THE SAME! The customer service is TRASH! They steal customers Money! The service is just crap! I don’t understand why I have to call monthly and I still don’t get MY CREDIT! This is complete crap! GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!,0
"Worst Customer Service I’ve ever experienced. I have an internet outage business I manage . I will call on a Monday and I am told the earliest they can send someone is Friday, I will take it since I had no other option. No call , No show. When I called again I am told the same thing, same results. To have someone to talk to takes about two hours waiting on phone. It’s over a month now still no internet and no one has come by or called whereas the last Rep I spoke with promised to call and follow up.What a horrible service. I wished I had another service provider in that zip code",0
"BEWARE- YOU HAVE TO WAIT LIKE 2 HOURS TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE just to discover you aren’t getting sent a shipping label, you just need a code- then the next you call, you just want to know why you are being charged anything- you get transferred back and forth until customer service closes and also, you thankfully have a login and realize you are charged almost 5 dollars for using ATT air for less than an hour, before realizing the internet you are sharing is just as good and significantly cheaper so you return the device, yet still get charged $4.39- hahaha okay- I WILL NEVER EVER EVER USE ANY ATT SERVICES- THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!

"I switched over to AT&T a bit over a year ago.Issue #1: I switched with the 'any device, any condition' to obtain the newest android phone for free.  I traded in six devices and received $0.00 credit and I have been stuck paying for all six new phones.Issue #2: I enrolled in the military discount Signature Program.  It was never applied.Post month response: It may take a few months for the old devices to process and have your account apply all rebates and offers.  (My fault for forgetting.)Time lapse 1 year: Need another phone.Informed the more lines, more the savings.  Informed billed would go from $270 to $210 with the extra line. Billed increased another $40.Issue #3.  Three attempts to the same store to add the military ""Signature Program"" to my account.  Provided military ID with driver's license that states ""Veteran"".  Store employee called and verified military status.  Received email 14 days later that 'proof of eligibility' was not received and removed the discount.  Three times personally done at the store with employees and on the phone with the head center and cannot get contract obligations from AT&T.Update called the AT&T service line at home and requested a call back.  I got a call back and no representative.MILITARY and everyone DO NOT USE AT&T! You will be swindled.",0
"The WORST customer services EVER. I haven't had Internet for 6 days, they don't know when it will be fixed. They told me to be home for the engineer which didn't arrive. Then they tell me that I did not need to be home. Have taken the afternoon off at a loss of 160 dollars for no reason. Their response was oh I am sorry. No offer of compensation for their incompetence or lack of correspondence.",0
"I have nothing but problems since switching to AT&T.  First, they claimed they did not receive our phones via mail when I had signed receipts from their employee.  I got that resolved, but they thought they were doing me a favor when they were wrong.Now, I cancelled a phone.  My plan was 2 phones and my husband died recently and I disconnected his phone and returned it [fortunately this time they indicated receipt].  Now I am trying to figure out the bill for one line.  Every month it is different, each time I call or visit the store I am given a different amount.  For two phones the total was $173.  I wrongly assumed it would be about half that.  Wrong, it is looking like $129.81, I was told $72.99 in the store, $99.00 by an agent via chat and see in my account that is $129.81.  I questioned why it would not be about half and was told that the discounts only apply to multiple lines.  So if you are single and use one phone, they don't care about you.  You are paying the highest rate possible.  I am looking elsewhere where one phone/one person is valued.  Worst mistake ever going to AT&T, do not switch no matter who you have.",0
Worst customer service. Don’t waste your time & money if you have other providers choose them. They have hired worst people to give phone support. They will cut the call on you.Very disappointed.,0

This monopoly allows consumers information to be stolen and shared all across the black web allowing your bank accounts to hacked and drained then at the detriment of the poor customer demands payment after they access 2 payments from your account in the same month. Slows down service because you demand accountability for the transactions on your account but you are nobody so there will be no accountability. Class action suits are not the formula to provide accountability there needs to be something done to protect & prevent . I’m just a disabled veteran trying to survive only on a monthly income.  My account was hacked giving way for my banking account to be accessed and drained. But do you think AT&T cares about a customer that has been loyal over 2 decades:. They don’t!!,0
I purchased an extender due to my internet coming in and out the extender was right next to my tv made no difference this company charged me still for months I never used service had to do a chargeback had Elisabeth from AT&T presidential services reach out acting like she would help she completely stopped responding to my emails. I won’t ever trust this company again !,0
"At&T cut our copper lines 5 months ago without reason or warning leaving us without phones or internet. We are a small family business. They cost is over $10,000 in loss of sales and created a nightmare of a situation. After months of trying to call them they refuse to fix the situation by restoring our service. We have not been able to pay our bills without internet because our credit cards did not go through. AT&T cut our service, refuses to restore it, forcing us to go to Comcast. Now, AT&T refuses to port over our phone number we've had for 40 years. I would like an explanantion",0
THIS MAY BE AN AUTHORED DEALER BUT AT&T HAS THE WORST SERVICE. I JOINED MY HUSBAND PLAN SO WE CAN SAVE AND IT HAS BEEN THE WORST EXPERIENCE. MY DAUGHTER IS IN COLLEGE AND HER SERVICE IS NO GOOD UNLESS CONNECTED TO THE WIFI. MINE PHONE SERVICE DOESN'T EVEN WORK WHEN I GO OUT OF TOWN. THEY ARE HORRIBLE. IF YOU THINKING OF GETTING AT&T DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"DO NOT USE AT&T!!!!  I had just horrendous problems throughout my whole time with AT&T. From being sold phones that did not work to being charged for an entire month of service after the account was cancelled. The customer service is horrid if you can even get to talk to a real person. DO NOT USE AT&T!!!!!USE TMOBILE!!! I'm much happier now with out my outstanding service from them, especially a billing department that knows what its doing.",0
Awful company. Moved out of my house 7 months ago and still unable to cancel my internet. 3 hour hold times with retention and then they hang up.,0
We allowed ATT workers in our property to do their work in our backyard. I had asked them nicely to clean up after they finish their job and to make sure they leave things as they were. I took photos to show the disarray they left upon finishing their tasks five days ago. I shared this information with ATT reps and they have been unable to send someone to arrange those items lying on the ground in the manner they had originally found them. Quite irresponsible!,0
"I learned a long ago that AT&T can't be trusted to give you a straight answer. Unfortunately, I relearned that lesson recently when I ordered their internet service.Their website said it was available at my home address but it turned out it's not (one agent told me it was - another told me it wasn't). It wasn't easy returning the device to AT&T - an agent told me I could return it either to any AT&T store or to any UPS.  The AT&T store I took it to said 'no, you have to return it to UPS'.  UPS took the return with no problems. This whole fiasco, from beginning to end, consumed about 6 hours of my time. Both my wait time to speak with an agent AND to receive a call back was 1-1/5 hours. Never, ever again!  This is yet a followup to my ongoing saga with AT&T:  They've done 2 incredibly more stupid things, causing me to spend an hour on a phone call with them and replying to another senseless email they sent.  The hour phone call was in response to a bill sent me for use of the internet device, which of course, I was never able to use.  The email I received and had to reply to was explaining I'd returned the device along with a photo of the UPS receipt show when and where.  Hopefully, this is THE END.",0
"I called ATT a month ago for who knows what. While I was on the phone the rep (who I’m sure makes commission for up-selling) talked me into changing my plan (the one I’ve had for 20 years with no problems) promising that the 5G service would be much better and load faster. It was also going to cost an additional $5/mo (of course it is!) I agreed - how could I not?Of course - she never told me that there was no going back if I changed my mind. Which I did because the new service SUCKS! Now I can’t even load ANY websites, do any internet searches or use any apps unless I’m on WiFi. I’m not using any public/unsecured WiFi services so now my phone is useless. And even the phone calls are messed up - static, usually disconnect and I have to place the call multiple times.Thanks a lot ATT. After 20+ years I’m going to switch to Verizon. They can’t possibly worse than ATT.Also ATT - I can NEVER log into my account. And since you bought Directv you screwed that up too.I’m fed up and over ATT!",0
"Zero rating would be correct. I upgraded 3 phones and had to return them when I received the new phones. I just got one of the phones returned to me with a letter saying I didn't return them in the allowed time period, and am be charged $900 for my troubles. Customer service could not and will not work on a resolution. I will be changing my provider and canceling my DTV because of this unprofessionalism.",0
"I have been waiting for AT&T to install my internet service for one week, they keep postponing the installation, I work remotely, I already lost one week of work, I’m not going to get paid 😞, they have been postpone 4th times the appointment for the installation 😡 unfortunately AT&T is the only internet service allowed in this community. So disappointed with this company.",0
"After spending far more time than any customer should have trying to figure out why the ‘Blocked Contacts’ feature on my iPhone is ineffective, I was on another 24-minute call with AT&T’s tech support. This was just the latest in many calls and chat sessions that have gone nowhere. The same issue remains unresolved—and it’s been years.I’m talking about an iPhone 11-Pro I purchased directly from an AT&T store just before COVID-19 hit. So, this problem has been festering for quite a while. Let me get straight to the point: I’m done. I refuse to be your unpaid, unappreciated beta tester. I’m done dealing with spam calls slipping through despite being ‘blocked’ by a feature that should be reliable. But why do ALL blocked numbers ""slip through""?We’re talking about years of this nonsense—years of you pretending that spammers somehow outsmart your technology. Any competent business would have flagged and fixed this issue by now—either out of respect for their customers or to cut costs. Unless the real goal is to keep customers frustrated, waste time on tech support, and eventually push them toward paid “upgrades.” All the while, small business owners like myself bear the cost of wasted time and lost productivity.I decided to test this myself. Following your instructions, I called my cell phone from one of our business lines and blocked the number. The call went straight to voicemail—no ring, no notification. So why doesn’t it work this way for every other blocked caller? Is it that hard to make this technology consistent? Or is it designed to fail?Given AT&T’s resources, I find it hard to believe you can’t solve this. Especially when offering “upgrades” like AT&T Call Protect, AT&T Mobile Security, and AT&T ActiveArmor—each conveniently priced at $3.99 per line per month. I’m old enough to remember when the federal government broke up AT&T’s monopoly. What I see now feels like déjà vu—the same tactics that got you into trouble. And let me assure you, those tactics won’t work in today’s market.I’ve been a loyal customer since the 1970s. Not because you were the cheapest but because you were supposed to be the most reliable. I’ve paid a premium for that reliability—$115 for the remaining two lines, to be exact. But now? I’m looking at $15 per line elsewhere, with service that’s just as good, if not better. And to top it off, I’m sitting here with one bar of signal, practically within arm’s reach of the state Capitol.After decades of loyalty, I’m finished. I won’t keep paying for what I once believed was trust and reliability when it’s clear those values are no longer upheld. I urge others facing similar issues to reconsider their loyalty to AT&T. It’s time to explore more reliable alternatives.",0
I paid off 2 lines to save money and my other lines monthly payments increased. The extra charges that they don’t tell you about it’s outrageous.,0
"Been without wifi for over a week now since the date to fix my wifi keeps getting pushed back, first to last Saturday, then to Sunday, then to Monday, then to Thursday, then to yesterday, and now to next week's Wednesday. Frick att, they don't wanna fix my fricking problem",0
"I was given AT & T reward card with a value of $ 100.00Apparently there was some renovation going in house, entire floor remodeling including kitchen remodeling and we by mistake lost/ misplaced our reward card. The reward card was dated with expiration date of 4/24. We found that lost/misplaced card upon completion of remodeling, but it was too late since card was expired. I called reward card service and they mentioned may be AT & T customer service can help since card was issued with promotional services. Called customer service and based on talk with them, they refer back to card services.If both divisions belongs to AT & T one of them should able to resolve the matter with some kind of compensation/ replacement of card. But my all effort gone in vain. Not only that customer service even mentioned that we can reduced your phone bill by reducing your speed and that way you can save $ 10.00 per month in bill and recover your loss in next 10 month or so. I don’t understand that approach at all.At least they could have offered other way  by mentioning that ok let’s reduce your bill or give you break in different way to compensate.In my case basically it’s a total loss for me.I learned my lesson. I will wait and see what other companies will offer after such experience.",0
"AT&T installed new high speed internet lines into my neighborhood.  They came to my door offering the new internet service that included a $20 monthly discount because I had AT&T internet at my another residence in another city.  When my discount did not show up on my first bill, I called them and they said the discount would take several months to take effect but I would eventually be credited for the discounted amount.  After four months I called customer service again about getting the discount applied to my bill and receiving the credit for the first four months.  I was told by the supervisor that I would not be receiving the discount at all because I had moved  residences in the other city.  They said I would get the discount because I had another internet account. I still have that internet account in another residence 2 miles from the original one.  Their excuse not to give me the discount seems very unfair.  I will take them to arbitration and will be very surprised if I lose due to fairness and common sense.",0
I broke my phone and was convinced to upgrade to a post pay plan from my prepaid. The phone I got didn’t work and caused nothing but problems. My prepaid bill can put the 13th of the month and was charged. Then the charged me to upgrade which had for less than a day because I couldn’t get the phone to work. They said they switched everything back the way it was but kept getting wired messages from them about stuff that I have never had so I called to ask and sure asI was still on the post paid. To switch it back the charged me anothermonth on top of the stupid restocking fee of damn near everything I spent. So for this one months worth of service I have now been charged over 300 dollars. Well I am either getting compensation or they lost ola customer for life. This is the worst easy to say thank you for being a customer. Your business is disgustingly corrupt and I will never ever suggest anyone go to att. I would rather communicate by pony express!!!!!!!!!  I am still in disbelief that this also took a hole week of fighting to get my phone back to where it was supposed to be. I am also going to be calling a lawyer and the bbb to report what has happened. And on top of that you whine and cry about my language when you get in your car to go home you music says worse things than I do. Stupid stuff right there,0
Another day without service..I'm done.. switching to Verizon,0
"Took out an international plan when travelling abroad but was nevertheless charged as if this never happened. Auto pay took the money out of our account, but when challenging this, was told a credit would be passed on the next bill. This should not be the case and a credit to our bank account should be passed immediately.",0
We got a contract with AT&T through Sam’s club.  They offered a good rate with a discount for returning our old phones.  We mailed our old phones to the address provided and never received the discount.  When we called them they said they never received them.  We called trying to correct the situation but were unable to.  Now we got our new bill and there was an extra $40 on it.  Now they claim that a promotional offer through Sam’s club ran out and we will have this charge until our contract runs out.  This was never stated when we started our service.  We will never use them again.  Horrible experience from the beginning,0
Poor customer service unprofessional prices are extremely high while service is poor. AT&T should be shut down immediately . Data breach… they have a lawsuit currently going on ..,0
"Terrible service and reception. And ever increasing bills. They quoted me around $85 per month and my bills have been approximately $200 per month going up each month. I’m paying four times at ATT for cell service only what I was paying at xfinity for three lines and internet. Also when I travel outside of Houston, I get no service/coverage and in certain areas it goes into SOS mode with zero service",0
"THEY WILL SCAM YOU!!! DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT FOR YOUR OWN FINANCIAL SAFETY EVER USE AT&T. YOU WILL GET SCAMMED.AT&T has been charging my account since October 2022 fraudulently. I moved apartments and cancelled my services with them in October 2022. They then requested I send back the equipment which I did. They continued charging me every month for 2 years and NEVER sent a single notification via email or mail that they were charging me monthly. They kept charging me after I cancelled their services and returned their equipment. Two weeks ago, I discovered they were doing this and called them to be refunded for those backdated months. The employee named Sandro (account manager, in the loyalty department) told us to cancel it again on august 7th 2024 so we would not continue to be charged and said he would open an investigation. He said the investigation takes up to about 7 days to process so to call back then. Upon calling back 8 times since then, I have not had a single representative able to help us move the process along or have any information to give us. Today, I called back again (and was escalated to several managers) and they told us that if we had kept the account open and not cancelled it with Sandro, then right now they would’ve been able to backdate the cancellation so we could have been reimbursed for those months. So an AT&T representative guided us in the complete wrong way and now caused us not to be able to be reimbursed for those charges. Not to mention, AT&T can check the usage and see that we were not using their services at all since October 2022 (when we moved out of our apartment) AND have an email confirmation for returning their equipment. Every representative kept telling us there is no record of a cancellation so we basically are correctly being charged. How can that be possible when I have a confirmation of returning the equipment? Did I just randomly want to return your equipment and continue paying for internet even though I don’t even have your equipment and no longer live there? makes no sense. Then they tried to say the returned equipment could be for a reason unrelated to the cancellation, like maybe an exchange. BUT THEN WHERE IS MY EXCHANGE? There is no exchange. It was for a cancellation. I have been on the phone cumulatively for over 6 hours trying to resolve this issue and no one even cares to help me in a meaningful way. I have been transferred to Loyalty, Customer Service,Billing, even Collection. The worst part is despite all of this headache, numerous phone reps will put me on hold and just never return. I have dealt with this so many times, I’m not sure if this is a tactic to get off the call Scott free when they cannot figure out what to do, but please try to imagine how annoying that would be. Every manager has told me the best they can do is credit my account for 1 month of the back dated charges. How can a company like AT&T have such an abysmal resolution process? I will be sharing this story with as many friends and family members as possible",0
"Complaint: After seeing almost every other company offering plans for what i consider the same level of service for substantially less per month, i reached out to AT&T to see if there was anyway to lower my bill. I figured that with over 20 years of being a loyal customer they would be able to do something, however to my surprise they weren't willing to do anything so i cancelled my service and transferred to Verizon for over 100 dollars less per month. Upon transferring my service i made sure to pay my balance to $0 while i was in store to ensure i was paying whatever the current balances due were paid. Now, i get a call 2 months later saying i still owe almost $300, which is impossible because you can't cancel service AND i also transferred my 2 phone numbers to the new carrier. After speaking with a support manager Alex he kept telling me it was for a past due balance and didn't care to look at the facts (it's not possible to transfer a line or service altogether especially to a competitor if there is a balance due). Alex tried to say that the final payment was reversed to which i told him no it wasn't and would provide my bank statement as proof...then he said ""i'm sorry sir that must be a lie."" He didn't request for me to send it to AT&T to clear up the discrepancy, no, after 20 years with the company I'm now a liar because I won't let them extort me for another $300 dollars. If i hadn't transferred to a new provider i bet that bill wouldn't have mysteriously appeared. I'll also be filing a complaint with the attorney general as well as posting this exact review on every social media channel i can because this is a horrible company that everyone should stay away from!After being a customer of AT&T for over 20 years there is nothing good to say regarding this company. AT&T could care less about their customers and have made that blatantly clear to me.",0
AT&T makes company policies just to find ways to screw their customers over. Just so you know AT&T now lock eSIMS (which in my opinion shouldn't be legal) and will not let you add a second one even if you are still paying a monthly bill with them. I have never had so many problems as a loyal customer before. My mother and I have had a line with them for decades and are honestly probably going to switch now because there are just too many awful experiences to count anymore. I don't understand why AT&T does not care about their customers. If anyone is planning on traveling do not do so with AT&T. They have super high daily costs on their international plans and will lock your SIM on your iphone so you are not allowed to get a local number. We will not be associating or dealing with AT&T any longer after such an awful experience.,0
"Worst. Company. On. This. PLANET!!!!!If you're thinking of switching providers, or looking for a service, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go with ATT. They are completely incompetent and continue to mess things up. Yall should be out of business.",0
"In the last 5 months I have been without internet for 4 weeks. This time I had an appointment on Tues and nobody showed up.

They made me pay $83 dollars after I canceled my 2 phones from their service. The phones were only active 3 days and I still had to pay that much!! I never will use AT&T again. Horrible customer service as well.,0
"1) my phone was disabled twice months apart. The other day my phone was disabled for 5 hours, the day before I could make calls. Yesterday I found out my second phone they set up 11 months ago could not receive calls, they fixed it today. But they would not credit my account for the non working phone. I went to two different AT&T stores, the first one said they were a satellite store, so they sent me across town to a “main store” and they said they couldn’t do anything either. I pay $140.00 for two phones, now with my new different wireless provider I pay $130.00 for 4 phones. Thank you AT&T! And my internet cost went down also!I would like to thank the awful service techs, and support staff for saving me money. Without your attention to do nothing, I would have never changed my phone, my internet, and my family’s phone and internet!",0

July 26 2024 my internet just went out. Tried all the reset crap 2 or 3 times. Called customer service and they sent out a technician. He said the line was broken and a new line had to be ran. After 3 no show scheduled times buried cable crew came out to bury a line that hasn’t even been laid yet. This happened 3 three different days. Finally a crew came out and ran and buried the line and left open on both ends for the technician to hook up. Two day later still nobody showed up. Every time you call and schedule a technician he never showed up. Come to find out the buried cable contractor never turned the finished ticket in. Called and scheduled a time again yesterday 8/19/24 again a no show. Called again first thing this morning and technician is supposed to show again today 8/20/24 we will see if they show today.,0
"Trash. The service was subpar, but nothing to complain about. What I can, and WILL ALWAYS, complain about is that AT&T basically stole money from me.I called in September 2023 to have my service cancelled because I was moving to a different city and honestly couldn’t care less about keeping my internet going. The dude I talked to was nice enough and said he’d cancel, no problem. The thing is, he never cancelled my service. I found out in June 2024 after being charged for 5 months of internet nobody used. I know it’s foolish to hardly ever check my bank account, but I didn’t even think about it since I was under the impression my service was cancelled. I didn’t even receive emails about upcoming bills or activity on my account, so I really didn’t think anything was wrong.After discovering the charges, I called immediately to plead my case. I ultimately bit the bullet because the original guy never logged my request for cancellation, and there was nothing anyone could do without solid proof. I was pissed, yeah, but at least my service was cancelled.Now, the woman who cancelled my service told me I didn’t have to return the equipment because it was an older model. Guess who got fkn swindled, though!! Me, baby!!! I just got an email saying I owe $174+ because I haven’t returned my equipment.Same deal, I talked to some guy who didn’t know more than what was written on the back of his hand. He regurgitated what my account says without any attempt to reconcile the situation. He basically ended with, “pay it or don’t 🤷🏻‍♂️.”So, because AT&T is absolute garbage and can’t manage their records, I’m out over $700 (9 monthly bills + equipment). Absolutely nothing I can do about it now, since I moved out of the apartment and disposed of the equipment 10 months ago.",0
"This is a terrible company, customer service is almost non-existent. Coverage is terrible even on top tier plan it's slow, they throttle constantly and I have frequent drop-outs in Seattle one of the largest cities in the US. I also have international roaming but when I went to Vancouver I had no service at all while my girlfriend with T-Mobile had excellent service. We had to use her phone to finish navigation. All and I mean ALL my devices are purchased from Apple not ATT as I hate having companies lock me in when I own the product. ATT locked my phone anyway and refused to unlock it. First 24 hours then 48, then they said I tried too many times and to wait 30 days which is I'm pretty sure illegal to hold someone prisoner like that. Especially when not on a payment plan for devices and the devices were purchased externally through Apple. I no kidding spent 2 days and over six hours on the phone with customer service and still didn't get it resolved. I will never give ATT another dollar of my money. Even the reps at Apple store said ATT is horrible and the only carrier who tries to control to that level or intrude on personal data like they do.",0

I currently have internet home phone & wireless and when I say these people is killing my pockets I am done! Every month they adding extra funds on top your bill! They still make you pay for a bill that you are asking them to take off! If your account is suspended they want you to pay extra money to get it back reconnected!! I ain’t seen anything like it I am gone I no longer recommend or will stay with this company!! They are getting over on any & everyone!!,0
"AT&T is horrible, they lie just to get you in then they jerk you around with your service and your payments. You will never know from month to month what you owe on occasion there will be $50-$100 bill increases with no change to your plan or usage. One person will assure you of one thing while something entirely different will be the outcome and then you are stuck with it. I have been stuck with them for nearly 4 horribly miserable years. DO NOT GO TO AT&T.",0
"I would give them a zero star if I could! The tech support was never able to get the phone number working, so we cancelled the line and went with another carrier after over a month.  However, the billing department continued to charge us not only for the month we were trying to get the phone up and running; they charged for the entire next month.  So basically, I was stuck paying for 2 months of service I never received, or they would report me to credit agency!",0
"I am an extremely frustrated customer. AT&T’s internet service has been incredibly disappointing. I’ve had to call them about 20 times, and each time, I get transferred to different departments without any resolution. They’ve told me my account is too complicated to handle, and as a result, my internet was cut off.I came home from work on Friday to find that my internet was disconnected. I called AT&T immediately, but despite their assurances that they were glad to help, nothing got resolved. Instead, I was passed around like a hot potato between departments. I spent nearly 7 hours on the phone with them, from 4 PM to 11 PM, only to be told they couldn’t help me and that I’d have to wait until Monday for the Sales department to reopen in their business hours.What’s worse is that I did speak with the Sales department during my initial call, but they transferred me to another department. After 7 hours that, I was told I needed to go back to Sales again. This is the worst service I’ve ever experienced, especially when I was already exhausted from work.I’m really want to changing my internet provider, but unfortunately, my apartment has a contract with AT&T, so I’m stuck. I’ve already expressed my concerns to the apartment management, urging them to cut ties with AT&T. They left me without internet for the entire weekend, which is unacceptable.",0
Bought a iPhone 14 and was told they cannot unlock it and sent me somewhere else,0
"My wife and I shared a grandfathered data plan with my mom until she died. My mom didn’t write down her AT&T password or passcode, so whether my wife and I were going to stay with AT&T or switch, the only way to do it was to go the local AT&T store to transfer our lines to an account in my name. When I went there, they told me we weren’t allowed to keep the grandfathered data plan and would have to switch to unlimited. My wife and I use very little data, so I knew at that moment we’d have to switch carriers to get a fair price for the service we need. I set up autopay and paperless billing with AT&T before I left the store that day. 3 days later I ported our numbers to another carrier, and 2 days after that I received our final AT&T bill. I didn’t know until I received this bill that AT&T doesn’t prorate final bills. In addition to charging us an entire month for only 3 days of service, they also took away the $10 per line discount we should have received for setting up autopay and paperless because I canceled our service before the bill was generated. I tried multiple times on the phone and in online chat to make my case to customer service that we were unfairly overcharged. Even if I had conceded I was at fault for not knowing they don’t prorate, they at least should have reinstated the autopay discount when I explained our situation and the reason we canceled our service. Every representative I spoke to gave the same answer: there was nothing they could do unless I reactivated our service. Doing so would have made no sense because my wife and I aren’t big data users.I will absolutely never be an AT&T customer again. They showed no mercy to a grieving family and made us pay $160.32 on our way out the door for only 3 days of service on 2 lines.",0
"We bought our IPhone 11 at 2021 and iPhone 12 at 2022 with their service until may, 2023. We then switched to Consumer Cellular without contract till now. When we are planning a trip overseas, we found out both iPhones are sim locked by carrier. The problem is that we can not use local data SIM card service, which are much cheaper that AT&T international roaming services. So we contacted to Consumer Cellular to help us unlock our phones. Consumer cellular response to us, that iPhones were not bought from them we have to talk to At&t. AT&T online unlock device service don’t let we submit request in, because those phones current service by their reseller, ask us to call consumer cellular instead. We were spent three days, have been back and forth kick off forever. We are now locked to consumer cellular and forced to use their services forever and couldn’t use any other carrier companies service as we like to.",0
"Is there any way we could take them to court? what are  our options?  They obviously are going to continue their business counting on people not wanting to switch again.

One week later they never arrived, never calls and when we call the service dept. they told us they do not have enough techs to install, so it must be moved to the end of the month. ....after one hour on the phone we just cancel it. ....Save yourself a headache they do not have enough employees to serve central Florida and that is the true as i was informed by their own people.....",0
"I was told the only way to remove my deceased husband's email and change the password he set up was to go into an AT&T store. What a joke, but I'm not laughing. The gentleman who helped me was very nice, but he didn't correct what I asked him to. AT&T plans to bill me by my deceased husband's email and account he set up. It will not work but you can bet I will receive a late charge again because the customer service can't or won't listen to their customers. Go out of business AT&T. You don't get it.",0
"I've been a AT&T customer for years.  When moving to an area where AT&T coverage is poor we changed carriers.  I cancelled my service in April of 2024, every month they continued to bill me.  Average call time on hold was an hour (one time 2 hours - I was being stubborn).  The bill in July was treated differently and AT&T claimed they'd never received my cancellation and had no record of previous conversations.  I guess the bill reversals was spontaneous kindness on their part?  When I called the final time it was clear it was a collection agency masking itself as AT&T.  There was extremely unprofessional behavior, shouting etc in the background.  I opted to pay the final bill which I did not owe because the constant calls were impacting my health.  I will never be an AT&T customer again and will ensure all my friends and family know they are criminals and are no longer the trusted corporation of the past.",0
"They were good for a while, until my bill got over $300/month. Granted it was for devices for 4 people, but when I found a better deal they wouldn’t release the devices to port out and I ended up having to port out one by one which cost $60 total that I didn’t account for. Bad business practice.",0
The customer service and support is dead on arrival. They are racist. They lie to take your money. And have no dignity when caught in lies. And when ask to speak to a manager NOBODY knows anything. Just kill the company! ALL the time TO ALL people !,0
"My internet service has now been out almost 2 days. They offered me $15 for the inconvenience. That may have worked in 2019. However, with most people working from home this is a major inconvenience and you offered $15. Internet isn’t the only service I can’t use right now. This is absolutely ridiculous. The reps suggestion was to use my mobile hotspot. Why should I have to if I paid for internet in my home.  He offered to get me a phone contract through AT&T. I assume the service is as bad as the internet service. Seriously thee worse experience and thee worse resolution. I have other service providers that can hook new service up quicker than you guys are fixing the issue.",0
Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. I tried them 7 years ago and left because of awful CS. Came back today and had my fiber plan approved and decided to back out because of the excruciatingly terrible service. If this company was a startup and not a monopoly it would never get off the ground.,0
I have been on the phone for over 2 hours today with nothing resolved.  We have a simple online logging in issue.  I asked to speak with a manager and they just put you on hold to transfer you and then drop the line.,0
"The worst experience in my life.I have been trying to talk to costumer services for 3 weeks and today I was on hold for 6 hours and right at one hour 1:39 minutes exactly they hang up on me.I decided to drive to the store, first one couldn’t help and the second one too.This is seriously ridiculousStay away from this company",0
Me and my father have tried to get a phone hooked up and The have continuously made it more difficult to hook up 1 Phone we had already set up a account with them for a new phone of mine. They then charged us for trying to activate said phone. When testing the phone to see if it worked; it would not work. Trying to work with them has been a big pain in the ass.,0
I asked the agent to cancel my watch line because the service never worked but I was being charged for it. I gave the specific number associated with the watch.Instead the agent cancelled my phone service.I had to cancel multiple business meetings and spend 2 hours being transferred from agent to agent as they didn't know or have the power to help get the number and line back.This is Still not resolved as I write this.,0
I have talked to 10 different people trying to transfer my landline back to a t & t.  I have to keep explaining over and over again.  It's been since the ending of July that I started this.  They are of no help.,0
"I’ve been using AT&T service for me and my wife for about a year and a half, bought there to phones. When I decided to switch to other connection provider, I wasn’t able to cancel the service, cause company has a tricky payment system - you’re paying not before starting to use their service. So my bill was published while I already using my unrestricted plans. So I’ve paid for a next month. Then sever times texted in chat and even called to a company call center to make sure about a date till what I need to cancel service. So by the end I was assured that all is done and I still have about a week of already paid period… 3 months later I got an email with additional fees ~ 145$ for some late payment and something like that! I got an autopay, few representatives assured me that there won’t be any additional fees, and now they Threaten me with a collector’s company!!! Poor service, won’t recommend it anyone and more than that I will ask to find other company, cause the level of client service below zero!!! Scammers, shame on you!!!",0
If I could I would give AT&T a -5 stars. We had trouble getting them to resolve an issue with our billing.  It took 7 months to get it fixed and then they didn’t want to correct the past 7 months that were billed incorrectly.  We had all the ticket numbers from each month they told us it would be fixed on the next billing cycle.   They are truly the worst phone company I have ever  worked with.  Version was so much better.  I should have stayed with them!,0
"I am relatively new to AT&T, but I regret signing up with the company. I have to consistently call in to resolve the same issues repeatedly. I am not sure if their associates lack competence or not. I am getting sick and tired of having to re-verify documents and calling in to find out why my bill is significantly higher than expected. So far, I am not having a good experience and praying that a new phone service emerges so I can switch. I definitely don't want to go back to T-Mobile. Fingers crossed for a new emerge. Insurance used to be $10/$12 now it’s $17 per line? No!",0
"ATT does not care for their customers at all, they LITERALLY ALLOWED SOME RANDOM PERSON ADD LINES TO MY ACCOUNT AND WHEN REPORTED AND I FILED A POLICE REPORT I WAS TOLD OH WELL WE CAN HELP YOU PAU $1,000 or WE SEND YOU TO COLLECTIONS!!!! I HAVE BEEN WITH THEM FOR NEARLY 18years AND THEY ARE SHOWING THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AT ALL!!!!!!",0
"I have had a cell phone for about 3 decades, originally with Unicell here in the Mad River Valley of Vermont, and then ATT bought that company. I used to get 3-4 bars of service at my house, and very spotty service or none in the Valley. A few years ago they started charging extra ""administrative"" fees, as they started rolling out 5G. Then I started getting only 1-2 bars at my house. Last year they increased the cost of my plan (unlimited talk/text + 4 GB data with some rollover) by $5. Last month they notified me that my plan will be going up by another $5. I researched and decided to change to a prepaid plan for $25/month, prepaid for a year. I tried to do that over the phone but after waiting on hold for a while, I was told I would have to call the prepaid phone number. I called that number and it turned out that number was only for dealing with an existing prepaid account. I tried calling the main number again. The wait time was about a half hour so I opted for the callback. Within a half minute of receiving the callback, the call dropped. I waited for another call but none came. I called the number again and this time the wait was about 1 1/2 HOURS. I called a nearby (40 minute drive) ATT store. Matthew said he could set that up but I had to make an appointment. He set that up for yesterday afternoon at 3:30. I arrived a minute early and found Matthew with a family trying to make up their minds, and he was the only employee there. I waited about 15 minutes and I had to not only tell him that I had an appointment but I had to tell him again why I was there. He asked for my driver's license, but I knew from previous experience that store employees demand that and copy it or enter all of that info into their system, even if you only want to buy a charging cable. I only use my passport ID card because it has less personal info to get hacked. After entering all of the info, he asked for the ID again and had to re-enter all info. He told me that I did not need a new SIM, but I showed him on my phone that I did, so he charged me another $5+ tax and installed one. That process took another half hour. I now have service again, but I will be waiting to see what comes next. In the fine print, ATT can change terms at any time, without notice. I have never had a good experience with ATT and I do not trust the company. The terms are very long and complex (yes, I try to read the fine print).",0
try calling customer service wait hours then they hang up. dont dare ask to lower bill they said yes my next bill was double then took for ever to fix it.use anyone else they are horrible.,0
"I bought a used iPhone 14 Pro and my purchase verified at a local AT&T store. It took me many hours online and at the AT&T store to get my phone working with AT&T. And, it was an AT&T locked phone. Very frustrating. Now, after a year of horrible reception, I would like to have my phone unlocked. I have called tech support or six times and spent literally three or four hours on the phone. Each time they say it will be unlocked within three days. Now, nearly 3 weeks later my phone is still . I guess I will either sell the phone or try again. For the life of me, I cannot understand how horrible the tech support people are AT&T.",0
"My bill just went up over 10 dollars. When I signed up with A T&T, i was told that 55 plus price would never change, just over 59 dollars a month at that time. Now they are charging me over 70 dollars a month. I purchase this at Sam's Club.  The Girl that signed me up told me the price will remain the same as long as I never cancel or change anything. I will be shopping around for an honest company.",0
"Could not get high speed saleman off my property going door to door. Call AT and T and they told me if he came back call police. He came back next day and police had to come to get him gone for good. Why would a company tell me to call police on one of there employees, they should of told him to leave and not to go back to this home. We have no trespassing signs up.",0
"We have AT&t fiber optics home internet. We have thoroughly enjoyed our internet services and the people who came out to install it were very helpful and kind. I logged on to view our bill and saw a deal for a new phone. Because we had such good success with our home internet we decided to switch our phone carriers, get two new phones on AT&t, and bundle our services to save us some money. We called customer service to have all of our questions answered and the man was very helpful. After answering all of our questions he asked us if we were ready to switch over and we said yes. He told us everything we needed to know about the deal and how it would all work out. He then took down all of our information on our previous phone that we were to trade in for this deal. He told us that since we were doing it over the phone he would put us in for a kit so that we could send our phones back in the mail. This was ideal for us as we have a new baby. After we completed our phone order we received our phones in the mail a few days later. We got everything actived, set up and switched over just fine. When our first bill came around it was exactly what he had told us it would be on the phone. We got our first bill after 15 days of service. I called customer service back because we still hadn't received our kit to mail our phones in to AT&t. The lady on the line said that they had sent them out and we just needed to wait and that they should be in our mailbox within the next couple days. After a couple of days still not had received the kit so I called AT&t back. This time the man on the phone said that the deal had expired and we were no longer eligible for it. I did not understand how this could be possible as we were still within our 30 day activation time. He was very unhelpful and very rude. The next day I called customer service again and spoke to another man. He told me that there was no order in the system for us. There was no order for our brand new phones and there was no order for the mailing kits so that we could send in our new phones. I asked him how this was possible as I had two new phones and I was now paying monthly credits for two new phones. After spending about an hour and a half on the phone with him and he was supposedly digging around our account trying to find out what was going on he told me he was sorry but there was nothing he could do because there was no record of anything. I went to our email account to try and find the order email and it is no longer available and I can no longer access any information about our order through the online app or by going through the desktop online. On my next day off of work I went into the AT&t store and spoke to the manager and explain to him all of this. He said that this was a very common issue that AT&t was dealing with when it came to processing online and phone orders. He said he was sorry but there was nothing he could do for us and we were just going to have to pay for the phones. I told him this was not acceptable and that they needed to figure out a way to rectify this situation because I did not switch to AT&t to buy two brand new phones. I could have done that with my old phone company. I am now in the process of trying to go back and speak to a different manager and if nobody can help me and they're sorry and we are just out of luck then I guess I'm going to have to give them their phone back and switch back to my old carrier. I never had any issues like this with my old carrier. Sticking with AT&t to save 20 bucks a month is not worth going through all of this. This has been a very stressful and disappointing event. We have a new baby and we were not expecting to have to pay for two brand new phones. While an extra $60 a month may not be much to some it is a lot for us. I was so looking forward to having the same great experience as we did with our internet. I'm so saddened by the lack of disregard and unhelpfulness I have received in this matter.",0

"If I could give a -5 star I would. This company has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Hung up on my call, didn't call back when the robot said they would. It took 2 days and a huge amount of wasted time. I have been a customer for 25 years. They misrepresented their products to me so we decided to go with another carrier. They have made it incredibly hard on me and my husband to transfer with a new number(we asked to keep our old numbers) because we are owners of a small company  & there are ALOT of business contacts not to mention personal contacts we have to sift through and make the change. AT&T would not. there is not one good reason for them to keep our old numbers. My number was also completely cleaned up, no robo calls, no spam!, and now I have to start all over! I recommend, first DO NOT go with AT&T at all! They are really much higher than most  all carriers. They are not user friendly at all. All the major carriers have sub carriers & they all use the same cell towers. Save yourself the money and down the road aggravation.",0

"On April 17, 2024 Geraldine Walsh went to the AT&T store at 10 Washington Street, Norwell, MA to get a new phone.  She gave her iPhone 12 PRO to the store manager as a trade-in for a new phone.  The amount for the iPhone (trade-in) was going to be $750 as quoted by the manager.  He did not give her a receipt as he said the credit would show up as a credit in her online bill.  When after 2 months Geraldine did not see the credit, she called the store.  That manager is now at a new store.  The current manager told her there was no ""record"" of her iPhone 12 Pro being given to the previous store manager as a trade-in.  She then called AT& T multiple times - and they also told her there was no record of her trading in her phone.  They did nothing to help.  Finally, ""Missy"" from AT &T said that it was up to Geraldine to prove that she gave the manager her phone and that she should file a police report. Geraldine has now filed a police report, and they are going to pull the stores camera.  That AT&T was so completely unhelpful is so awful.",0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I have been a loyal customer for decades. I had the UVerse bundle and called customer service because I was having computer disconnect, TV streaming would freeze and you would get kicked off of your tablet or phone multiple times daily. The AT&T customer service person told me he was going to get me set up with Spectrum because in my area AT&T cannot offer the bandwidth/speed I need for multiple people & devices. I asked the agent if I called AT&T or Spectrum and he said AT&T. So in Jan 24 I received the Spectrum router & modem. In Feb 24 I set up the spectrum account totally remotely and then sent the AT&T equipment back via UPS. I didn’t think anything of it and recently looked through my bank statement and found I have been getting charged $71/month from AT&T. Elsa, the supervisor I eventually spoke with because I felt they should refund every penny they have been taking since I returned their equipment told me:1. You didn’t call to disconnect service (what the hell is the return of equipment??? A continuation??)2. There is no way I could have had Spectrum set up remotely from my home, I would have had to have a Spectrum service person at my house….bullcrap, I still have the remote set up instructions they sent with the equipment next to my spectrum router.3. Even though they take the money directly from my checking account, they will send me a 1 month refund on a prepaid Visa….hmmmm, you had no problem taking it out, but you don’t wanna put it back4. And yeah, a 1 month refund because I didn’t ‘call to disconnect.’ I also didn’t call to get a Spectrum account, it was their employee who recommended it…. Sent back their freaking equipment and if they interrogate my wifi, they can see I have not used it in months. Just wanted service without so many disruptions.So dissatisfied on so many levels. I’m looking to change my cellphone service provider and I will never go back. AT&T stinks and they are not good faith actors.",0
"I want to share this in as many places as possible because of the terrible customer service and because of the unapproved charges I received from ATT while traveling. We were on a cruise and within a short period of time my daughter received the below messages then her phone was shut off.  I did not approve or agree to these charges. I didn’t ask for them to provide service on a cruise ship. Welcome to the awesomeness of ATT. What should have happened was that they should have asked me to confirm that I wanted this service provided. Instead they let it go and charged me for it. Sorry but that’s predatory. It’s like you’re taking advantage of a 14 year old kid and then their parents to make an extra buck. Meanwhile I have Verizon and no issues, no unapproved charges and no one feels taken advantage of. If you have issues good luck with that. The voice response unit is awful and wait time to speak to a human at up to one hour. This experience was terrible. My advice is go with Verizon because at least you know they won’t take advantage of you like this",0

Internet outages - I have had 226 outages since MIDNIGHT last night.  I run a network monitoring tool on my computer that pings 3 of the major internet domain name servers every 2 seconds.  When the monitor tells me it is offline I cannot connect my browser to the internet and my streaming TV picture locks up. This is a running problem for over 7 months.  I get so tired of their canned menu driven troubleshooting process - I have rebooted my router over 100 times to no avail.  They replaced it three times since last December but I still have issues. I bought a new computer to eliminate my equipment as the cause. I replaced all my ethernet wiring with cat 6e.  Still have this problem. No alternative available due to some agreement the neighborhood developer made with AT&T so they are the only provider allowed here. I cannot trust my connection to do medical or banking transactions - I am baffled....,0
"AT&T rewards John Stankey with his $24,500,000 salary notwithstanding that his recklessness has cost millions of loyal customers the privacy of their data.

"Multiple days / roughly 2+ hours per call per day attempting to resolve an AT&T created issue where an iPhone 15PRO upgrade purchased directly from AT&T, was activated under a new phone number not requested by the purchaser. The second existing phone number from an older iPhone 6s Plus that was being upgraded was added to the second E-Sim causing the iPhone 15PRO to have two phone numbers in it.  Purchaser request for cancelation of the non-requested number generated a bill for the full amount of the iPhone 15PRO that was originally purchased under an installment plan.  This sure seems like it was a 100% scam by AT&T, with an intention to mislead the purchaser into adding an additional line of service to an account or voiding the installment plan the iPhone 15PRO was purchased under in the advent this second line of service was delegated.AT&T Customer Service is unable to resolve, refuses to resolve or intentionally will disconnect calls related to this type of issue.",0
"They are, and continue to be the worst internet provider in the country. Don't waste your time. Go with Spectrum. I used to have them as a mobile carrier and internet. I was interested in having them install fiber... as usual they give you a block of 2 hours... of which they originally didn't come on the day scheduled. Then on the day it was rescheduled they were late... wasting my time, and having to push calls out. Their customer service is off shore and incompetent. When you call back hold times are close to an hour. Seriously... there is better products. What's sad is they are based in Dallas, and the service is still garbage here.",0

"Two phones on my account were traded in for new phones. I contacted ATT for the box & labels to return each phone. I followed the steps provided and mailed the two phones back to ATT. A month went by with no credits to my account. Another month went by so I called ATT. I was on hold for an hour. ATT rep stated it could take up to 3 months to see your credit. The credit for both phones is $1400. $700/per phone.I have called multiple times attempting to resolve this. ATT now says they never received either of my phones!! I visited my local ATT store and was told the mgr was going to escalate my issue- never heard back. I called ATT and asked for their trade in distribution center and the sales rep refused to transfer me and tried to upsell me something else. After 1hr30 min the rep hung up on me. Most recently I had a conversation with an ATT employee off the record and this employee stated that ATT had sent customers the incorrect label for trade ins.  The labels ATT sent customers for trade ins all went back to ATT sales. ATT says that they have no way of tracking either phone. I followed the directions with the correct box, label and timeframe to return these two phones. After having 6 calls with ATT, multiple chats & visiting the ATT local branch and getting nowhere I need to contact the Attorney General, BBB and leave reviews. ATT owes me my trade in money of $1400.",0
"Way too expensive not worth it .. what I pay for two lines is ridiculousl I have recently left AT&T … not only are they expensive when they had that quick outage they didn’t compensate anyone and if they did, it was for small amounts other than that they don’t do anything for you. They might give you a seven dollars off of $300 bill but what is that not my cup of tea",0
"AT&T internet in NW Ohio is a joke, I can't even use my phone on wifi. Cell service is very bad and now they sent me a email that price is going up. Guess I'm going to save some money because I'm canceling. Price goes up but service stays the same",0
"I liked the people who helped me and the people who introduced me to AT&T. They offered to help me with my business. For a business I think it's great! However, later while using their service they had outrageous charges  for service. I knew it was going to be a lot but not like what I received. I agreed to pay for the charges for months hoping each month it would get cheaper by using wifi. However I couldn't get a clear explanation as to why they were so high. I left the country and my mom was trying to help me and she went to close my account and said I was changing service providers and they still charged us service after that meeting. I just feel like they could have been helpful and make sure when she went in that it wouldn't charge me so she wouldn't hear about it while I am gone. Unfortunately not only was that charge unfortunate they couldn't explain why it was so high. My advice find CHEAPER SERVICE! What was in the contract was way less than what was actually charged 2x that much. Or don't get in a contract with them. BUY your apple phone and AirPods somewhere else!! The people were patient just lots of unanswered questions I feel like they say call corporate about the charges.",0
"This company has the worst ""support"" service for wireless I've ever encountered. Handed from one incompetent agent to the next, while having to explain the purpose of the request each time, ultimately led to being dumped back into a general call queue.

"When it comes to cell phone plans. They will con you into getting deals and never hold up their end of the deal. So that lovely savings you thought you will get, non-existent!!! Also after our contract was up, We bounced to another carrier. Not only they shafted us with prorating us, they charged an additional month after we canceled our plans. So we paid for another month with non-existent service. The representative didn't even attempt to make it right. Denied us from speaking to a manager. Denied our refund. This is Straight Up Theft And Fraud!!!!",0
"The services really sucks i can't even connect to the app when i got 5G indicated in my screen and to top it up i am paying a lot for this and they won't even fix the issue i had for six months. I am constantly being charged for ""one time charge"" restoral fee that is not even my fault. I have talked to 5 or 6 agents that says the same thing that they can help with the issue and at the end all results are the same. They will waste the time chatting and ask tge same questions and instead of fixing the issues they will just go in circles and to end it with they could not help and the issue is with the other department and they are closed already and have to schedule but when you schedule a call back for the next day guess what? Nobody will call. I got all the chat scripts that i downloaded i got screen shots and screen recording of the 5G that can't even connect to the their app just to prove it whenever i need it. I constantly ask for support to have my issues resolve and i don't think something is being done. I don't care if i pay 160$ per month for a reasonable service but not like this. I checked all the bill i payed and there is a lot of restoral and one time payment that they charged me they charged me double on some bills. Somehow my fault coz i don't check it but now i checked everything and add all of it damn i payed more than i need to and they are robbing me in front of my face all the time.

"At the request of a scammer, AT&T transferred my phone # to Consumer Cellular.  The scammers then attacked my bank accts and my 401K.  AT&T claims no responsibility and have since, charged me for the ""free"" phone ($330.50 +tax), made me spends hours on the phone with them (now 40 hrs and counting) to resolve the issues with AT&T.  They also charged me for a temporary phone (3 days at $60.50 + tax) to contact credit card companies, utility companies etc. (about 35 in total) that AT&T put at risk.  They are now having trouble reinstating the installment plan (and subsequent credit) for the remaining 14 month left on the installment plan.  I've been told by numerous people that the installment plan was reinstated and a credit issued when, in fact, that has not yet occurred (after multiple calls and more than 5 hours on the phone with them; currently I've been on a call for 2 hours and 23 minutes).

At&t sucks service is trash customer service is trash and there home internet us trash why start a company expand to make house internet to keep up with competition but you guys as a company can't even have a basic level of communication within your departments what's the point I can't even pay my bills together for home wifi and my cell phone fyi me and my money will be going somewhere where they can provide all the services I have to jump thru hoops just to pay on I will go to a company that has there communication and customer support as a priority vs an opinion....better service and price with a pay as u go phone from Walmart I am sad that I have anything to do with at&t more reviews on other platforms have a good day don't get at&t there's a reason there score is so low,0
I just switched phone service from Metro pcs to AT&T. I cannot believe that Metro Pcs service is better than AT&T I can’t use my phone half of the time because the service is bs.,0
After 4 years of service I had a suspension of service for a very small bill customer service was very rude and a matter of fact attitude and wouldn't even attempt to help me make payment arrangements after 4 years of service,0
"AT&T the worst customer service ever!!I went online, then on the phone then to an AT&T store. Three times in three days.I was told multiple times I was good to go. Only to find out someone messed up and my new phone is still not working. The last customer service representative spent over an hour with me. He said u can wait for the sim card to arrive in the mail or go to your local store and get one. So for the fourth time in three days I went to the store. Only to be told that I could not get one from the store even though they have plenty. I had to wait. Day 5 with no phoneThanks AT&T😞",0
I call unlock my phone but they're always try to push me to update and I said I don't want then they're try to delay and said my phone í have problems and can't unlock. There customers is bab and lie and want I pay for the next month,0
"This company had a policy of NOT pro-rating a bill if service is canceled mid billing cycle. If you're just ONE DAY into a billing period and cancel your service, you're on the hook for an ENTIRE MONTHS service. Additionally, once ypu cancel service and port your number, your access to your online account is suspended. Not a huge deal, UNLESS, you want to print out past bills or see your usage for the past billing period. The only way to see past usage is to contact the company and request paper copies of current,  and/or past bills. Which will cost you FIVE DOLLARS PER COPY. Something the customer rep DOES NOT DISCLOSE when you request said copies. We will NEVER return to this company. On principle alone.",0
They lie waste your time and overcharge.,0
"i have been with AT&T for 20 years. I went in to our local store to upgrade, I was shocked when my bill finally posted. I told the sales person in the store that I did not want the protection plan. It was on my bill along with the AT&T next up. I couldnt get through on the phone so I chatted with a rep. who said if its been under 2 weeks, I need to go back into the store. I did and local store said the protection plan and Next up are automatically added. To cancel you have to go online through the app. which still leaves me oweing the fees. I am furiuos. Not only did theyput the charges on my bill, the local salesperson never said anything about it to me.",0
The only reason I'm giving one star is because of the lady that tried to help me and got my internet working a little better. I reviewed them on the FCC And they reached out to me They scheduled a technician to come out They scheduled it for an account in Florida not my account so that was the first thing they got a guy to come out finally take a look at it that don't worry we're going to take care of it. The internet is working somewhat better but at the beginning of all this my bill was $40 and it should have been 30 only started charging me a late fee because I didn't pay that bill I said that wasn't my right amount now my bill is $180 and nobody will call me back I am having stressed out nightmares anxiety about this and all I said was I was leaving to go to another company and then tried to save my business The fact that they won't return a call or tell me what's going on I just don't know how they can continue to do this over and over. Like the 4th or fifth time that they haven't kept their word on something.,0
"I chatted with an agent to simply combine my two bills. I have one bill for my wireless account and another one for my home internet account. I requested to have the bills combined into one so that I don't have to pay two separate bills every month. This rep was so poorly trained that he did not even know he had cancelled my home internet altogether. I noticed my home internet not working during our char conversation and mentioned that to him, even tried to resonate with him. I said something like ""is there ay chance you accidentially cliccked something that could have caused my internet issue?"" He said no. Then he connected me to another rep who had me reset my gateway but service was still not restored. Then I got transferred to the third rep andfinally service was restored. Altogether I spent 3 hours chatting with AT&T all just to combine my two bills into one. Now my service is restored but God only knows if my accounts have been combined as I originally chatted with AT&T to accomplish. If I hadn't JUST cancelled with my previous home internet provider and paid early termination fees, I PROMISE I would cancel with AT&T. The gross negligence and complete lack of training is incredibly frustrating. This is NOT the first rep's fault. This is the first rep's manager's fault. The rep should be trained enough to at least recognize when he cancels a customer's service. It would be a cherry on top if he were trained to not cancel the service altogether. I'm Extremely dissatisfied with this interaction, so is my family since it occupied my time for 3 hours. Absolutely terrible interaction, AT&T.",0
I wish I had read this before I was trapped. Lie to about there plan price charged triple on the 1st bill. Then no one knows where the 1st quoted price came from. They will rip you a new one. Customer Service 🤣 No one knows what’s going on but can definitely get the bank account your payin from correct. Make sure you have enough in the bank to pay the extra if not you’ll never get out. Call Spectrum they got it together.,0
Yes I paid my bill August 2nd 2024 the company is saying I didn't the app said I did my account says I did I still say I don't if I don't pay it they won't shut me off well I got all the proof that I I need that I paid it off never had any problems with four separate now all of a sudden there's problems terrible service man terrible service,0
"I would give their customer service ZERO stars if it was an option, but it's not!When I call, every time, I am punching in verification codes, only to be asked the SAME information by the overseas employee once they finally pick up, and then they send me ANOTHER code to verify who I am. So, what exactly is the point of ME having a personal pin code if they simply send me ANOTHER pin code and waste my time??Then, I am always on the phone for at least 30 minutes, but usually an hour or more. AT&T used to have awesome customer service, but now, I know, when I call, it will be the worst ever.Right now, I've been on this current call for 35 minutes and 42 seconds AND I am only calling for a return label for a phone that has never been opened. Still in the shipping box. I am astounded they are still in business with this kind of service.",0
Aboustley horrible service they will lie straight to your face I was told by at&t repetitive that the phone I was getting was free for switching my and that I would not see a bill for 2 months now 2 months later I receive the guess wat they are charging me the phone and I did not receive my discount for having wifi already has been 6 months I continuously have to call because I am not receiving my discount to this day beware THER ARE LIAR'S I have herd from other people I am not the only one get everything in writing from day one they will rip you offP.M.,0
Horrible service. You’ll lose service at least once a day. Half the time the data doesn’t work. You get maybe 480p without buffer. Better off using a landline than this companies servers and towers.,0
"1. I placed an online order to trade in my existing iPhone 13 Pro Max and buy a new Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.2. The order succeeded and I received an email to pick it up at the store.3. I visited the store and the representative in Fremont, CA told me that the order was not accessible and that she needed to cancel the existing order and create a new one.4. We go ahead and cancel my online trade-in order and create a new order in the store.5. While creating the order, the representative never asked me if it was going to be a trade-in, which ideally she should have? Anyway, the order goes through after waiting for 30 minutes and I walk out with a new phone. I am assuming I will receive a FedEx label to send my existing phone to At&T.6. 20-25 days pass and I do not receive any label or email confirmation. I call in to customer support to inquire about the shipping label. The agent tells me the order was cancelled for some reason and that he has created a new trade in request so I can walk in at any time and return the device.7. I walk in after a week (I am a new dad) and the lady at the store tells me that she cannot accept it since I was 1 day late. Advises me to call the trade-in customer support to request for an extension.8. Sitting outside the store, I call in the trade-in customer support and they suggest that it's not doable and that I should reach out to AT&T customer support.9. I call in the customer support and they tell me to get in touch with trade-in customer support since they cannot extend it anymore.Being late by 1 day and not getting to trade in my $1000 iPhone turned into a horrible experience. In addition, they have added protection plans without permission increasing my bill by at least $30/month. I have talked to them to remove them but still no update.Not sure what's going on with AT&T but their service is turning into a nightmare. I will switch to another carrier along with my family and friends the moment I have paid off the phone.",0
"I’ve had AT&T 20 years. I had Singular which changed to them. 5 lines, family plan. My bill is always around $400 and when I have a couple phones being paid for it’s close to $500. I can never get a break or a reason why I pay double what my friends pay. Finally changing networks after 2 decades and I’m buying a home with a house pmt of $500. See ya AT&T! It was so fun giving you $6k a year. 🦶",0
"Telephone customer service is nonexistent. Multiple times I've waited on the phone, and finally left my phone number for a return call, but that call never came. Right now researching an alternate carrier.",0
"They lie. If they are speaking, they are lying. All 4 phones 'died' at the same time, a couple of months before being paid off. I took mine to 2 separate stores and they said they couldn't help. One said, ""I can sell you a new one."" ummmm...no",0
"Worst customer service experience ever! Was told one price then the bill is a lot higher.  Call them back and you’ll be on hold for 30 minutes, no matter the time of day “due to high volume”.  Reading other customer reviews, how is this company still in business?  Unless you like to be repeatedly lied to, you better find another company to deal with.",0
"Is there an option for no stars? I call to ask a question about a baseball broadcast, why the team I follow isn’t in the same channel. Pretty simple.I go to the site that says 24/7 service to go through the prompts to be told it’s after office hours.I find that misleading and am amazed a company of this size doesn’t have 24/7 service.",0
"Worst customer service. Read all reviews below. They are accurate. I experienced similar experiences: they lie, no way to complain, spent hours on the phone trying to fix over charges, still they dont fix it, they advertise a plan at a price, it's another one...they lie.bad, really bad.",0
I fell for their trick twice. When I’ve gone to the AT&T store and bought a new phone I buy their offer for about $35 so that every time my screen protector needs changing I go in and they change it for eight dollars. That is until they decide to start doing away with the screen protectors and this happens at about two years kind of forcing you into buying your own screen protectors or buying another phone. The $35 offer is a scam as they don’t always have screen protectors that are “covered”. I am so done with AT&T . And whatever you DON’T BUNDLE! This one is their biggest scam!,0
"Switching from Verizon to at&t was one of the worst decision I made.  They have zero respect for their customers and they are liars.  Any call I make to my husband from the house to the garage (on our property) is ALWAYS choppy or gets lost.  I think they make no effort to better themselves because they don't care.  I should never have had someone come into my house while I was having another at&t repairman there.  I do not like the way they do this and only switched because the rep made promises I had to fight to obtain fully.  They are awful!!! The phone connection sucks and when I asked about fiber optic, they said it was coming to my area within a few weeks...I found out they lied about that!! I will make sure I switch to another company.",0
"You will be lied to consistently, by everyone.  This company will scam you into thinking you are getting a good deal and lie on the phone and do nothing to recover what you were promised.  Get everything in writing otherwise you are screwed.",0
Just found out the company is stealing money from me. I started keeping track of my phone payments when includes a 50 dollar phone install.ent payment because I suspected they weren't deducting it like they should have been. Come to find out I was correct and when I brought this issue to them they told me I was wrong and they were right even though I had documentation to prove it.,0
"Recently, I moved all my 4 iphones to a new carrier and thought that was the end of my association with AT&T. However, I came to find out that I had been carrying an extra iphone number since 2022 when my granddaughter went to the AT&T store and purchased a new iphone because her old phone had broken. Apparently, they had erroneously given her a new number (which she did not need since she kept her old number).  Consequently, they kept billing me for this number for an extra 2 months after my preceived departure from them and since I was on autopay and never looked, I did not realize this until I got the bill.  I brought this to AT&T's attention that I had been carrying this number since 2022 and argued that it was their fault and since there had been zero data and zero phone activity on this number, that they should reimburse me for the two months and also the 2 years of carrying this fictitious number and thus, end my business with them. They refused, even though I had been a loyal customer with them for close to 20 years. Greedy, calloused and worse company ever with no heart and zero customer loyalty.",0
At&t has the absolute worst customer service on earth there automated system is the worst on earth they need to go back to hiring real people because they system sucks I would give them a minus zero if it was available. I will be switching my services,0
AT&T wireless is the worse they make tons of promises to you and they don’t deliver the worst mistake in the world that I ever made was switching my phone service to AT&T wireless don’t get them,0
I just paid almost 360.00 for my bill and they’re still not letting me activate my line,0
ATT Service sucks sooooo bad.Can't believe how complicated it is to simple get logins for online account.CEO should be fired.,0
The company was hacked in April 2024. My personal data was exposed. I have been receiving quite a high number of phone calls and phishing emails. I have called AT&T and they say that my data is in tact yet a monitoring service I have has a data breach for my number and email. AT&T has refused to provide any support.,0
Went to the Germantown MD store to get help unlocking my phone to transfer to another carrier. They did nothing to help me except for me to go  to a site and put in unlock code which denied the unlock request.  The worker then walked away and started to change channels on a TV. I asked is that all? he said yes but didn't tell me anything. How rude to treat customers. That is one reason I decide to leave AT&T.  I just hope the manager does something about the poor customer service there.,0
"Broken promises and poor service! Black Friday ""deal"" has turned out to be a nightmare. I got charged $700 and more for the first 3 months because they claim they couldn't find my trade in phones! I have auto-pay and they didn't care or work with me. What if I didn't have the funds to cover the bill? AT&T is strictly about money and I will be leaving ASAP.",0
On hold waiting on tech support for 20 minutes and counting. I have never had a full day where there is no prolonged interruption to my internet. Same thing happened the whole time I had my phone service with them. The worst part is finally getting a tech on phone who keeps arguing that there is nothing showing on their end. So ridiculous. I hate this service.I used to work as a customer service agent and try to empathize with the tech support agents knowing that its technically not their fault if the service is terrible but WTH. And the monthly charges are highway robbery to top it off. I am definitely switching services. Good riddance.,0
"Absolutely the worst experience. I signed up for a phone and change of provider at an independent retailer, planned to turn mine in. Said I didnt want a contract, but then agreed to an 18 month plan.  Then when they sent me the wrong phone I went in to a store.  They gave me the wrong contract and I said no thanks, switch me to a prepaid. They didnt do that, sent me a bill 3 times what I was used to.Impossible to reach. forget a quick call to fix any issues.",0
"representative Prince promised to come back and help set up our equipment when it arrived. After several days of trying to get him to fulfill his promise , I have came to realize he has no integrity. After speaking to att support it is clear to me , they dont care..I do not recommend anybody to use att..they are a joke.",0
"At$t got me to sign up with a family plan for 135/month. 4 months later and have only had 1 bill at that price. Also came in last month without warning and took 799.00. Promised a refund in 30 days and now at 33 days have not seen the refund. Coverage, customer service, data all poor in central Oregon.  Do not buy from them.",0
A door to door sales rep sold me on the promise of a much cheaper monthly rate than our current carrier. We’d be saving $55/mo — turns out she gave me “misinformation” (as ATT put it) but there was nothing they could do to help. Currently paying more than before but I will be cancelling my wireless with them. Bait & switch lies. And now they get to keep my activation fees ($80).,0
Charged me $159 for something that never happened- an install of a router in a separate room. I called and they told me it would be refunded and it never was. Called back and they said they'd refund it this time. I have no idea if it will be.,0
Recently had a conv w at&t chat on trade in credits. At&t is not truthful and upfront about how the trade-in credits work. Also fail to mention that if you pay off phone early you will lose any remaining credits from trade in. And will not receive the full trade in amount. The idea of trading in a phone and having a number put on it and then stretching said amount out over 3 years is f’n stupid. Shopping new service. AT&T can take their service and shove it up their ass. Long time customer. No more.,0
I was basically scammed to switch to att in target. Now 1 year later the service in my area is so bad I have none in my house. Screw att I hope you go out of business. Then your call centers in India can’t even help us. I’m also a veteran and I would never recommend this to my worst enemy.,0
Just more useless gouging thieves I paid my bill on July first and they shut my phone off on the 25th .  Ripping me off that's all it's about and get away with it. They Don't deserve your money.  DO NOT USE THE AUTO PAY !!!  that's how they get away with doing that.,0
"I don't know why I'm surprised at the 1.3 ⭐ rating. And you wouldn't think it would be so low being such a big company. But the bumbling customer service is what I've experienced ever since signing up in December 2023. Not only are they outrageously priced as I had Metro prior but had to change carriers as I relocated to a remote area. With Metro I was paying 150.00 a month for 4 lines AND Internet. Never was charged a penny more. AT&T however is all over the board with different charges each month. It's never the same. I remember I had AT&T years back and that's why I left them and nothing's changed. Only the customer service has gotten worse because they're not organized. Every time I call in I feel a sense of dread because I know it's going to go wrong. I don't think that this company should be as big as they are. If they can't even handle customer service aspects, that should be easy. I have their internet service as well and every time I call in about it for some reason or another they can never find my account. I'm put on hold consistently and generally transferred to at least 3 to five people before they can finally figure out the issue if they can. They don't have a problem taking my money at the time the bill is due but whenever I call in they can never find my account no matter how many times I've called and been on hold for up to an hour at a time. It's beyond ridiculous And I don't know how a company can survive being so inadequate. I really just want to leave AT&T because of the customer service but of course they've locked me into something or other. This company is horrible",0
"I recently switched to a t and t fiber and wireless. The representative for the fiber is absolutely phenomenal. No problems whatsoever the Representatives for the wireless phone is a totally different story. The only thing they are concerned with is the dollar bill. I was specifically told by both gentlemen Joseph and Ralston, That my first bill would not be no more then $90 When I got the bill, I contacted both of these gentlemen, only to be giving a story of well this and that. I told them I was lied to and I do not appreciate it. Joseph asked me to give him twenty four hours to get the account straightened. Four days later, I have not heard from him.So I sent him a text asking him what the resolution was. To this very second I still have not gotten any resolution from either rep. Like I said, they are only concerned with the dollar bill, not taking care of the customer. I also stated I did not want automatic payments and not to put it on a particular credit card that I put the phone deposit on. When my first bill came in, it was an automatic deduction on the credit card.I told him not to use. These in home, wireless reps are absolutely noteworthless and do not care about their paying customers. I will be keeping my fiber internet But I will definitely be changing cell phone services.",0
At&t suck at helping the military. My son going in the military and they want put him on a line suspended his line while in basic training.  They want let you go into a store and show paperwork.  They want you go online and when told that didn't have a way to scan documents they said go online again.  Not all older generations know how to do those things or even have internet.  They said not their problem.  They have terrible customers service. They basically said for me to suck it.,0
"This company att&t can not improve because I have already proved that scenario and yes I did call and guess what they could not help me, me and my wife was lied to also about our monthly phone bill and it never stayed the price quote the they gave plus it went from 110 to 120 to130 to 140 to150 to 160 and last of all 170. This is not good service it's called corporate greed. And when I did call this is what they said is that the only way they can lower my bill is to take the auto pay and that will lower our bill 20 dollars, now if this isn't corporate greed then then nothing is att are crooks and the public needs to not do buissness with greed and robbery, all it is is political theft and as far as I'm concerned, as my father told me (  there's nothing worse then a thief and a lier ant att fits both bills",0
For one week we didn’t have internet service we called them the The schedule it no one shows up not even a call to cancel three times i don’t understand have this company still in business,0
The worst scamming company ever. Sold us 2 cheap phones for $120 whilst in America that did not work. When we asked for our money back after 24 hours they refused.,0
They are the most dishonest and cheating company ever. They lie about product and service. Tell you the truth straight talk is better and cheaper. The way the economy is They will try to cheat you no one needs that. So before you do don't. Don't believe them. If so I'm sorry for your lost of money.,0
"I have been an AT&T customer for 25 years or so.I have finally reached the end of the line with them. The wireless network speeds have really taken a nosedive in the areas where i work and live. I have compared my speeds with coworkers with same model phones their through puts was 300-400bps and mine was 80-100. ATT store said normal for this area. Wife gets new I-watch with cell data. We go to add watch data plan to our acct and they said there is a hold on our acct. We are delinquent on $1,500. I said impossible never have been and the balance due on acct was $0. They said i have to go through fraud dept and get a police report and prove it is not mine. Next day check my credit I have a default and is in collections. I have never received any notice from ATT or a collection agency. So, 25 yrs of being a customer and an acct that has never been late on a payment has to prove that it is not my debt. Because ATT did not do its due diligence in protecting my account and confirming the identity of a person making a fraudulent purchase on my account. I will be changing from ATT. Their blatant disregard for their customer will cost them more than they are saying I owe them. At $500/month it is there loss. So steer away from ATT would be my suggestion my friend. Sorry to get long winded.Signed Aggravated & Frustrated.",0
"Customer service sucks beyond belief. First, they don't post the information I need to obtain a PIN to tranfer service. They pretend to, but the information posted says to click a link that DOESN'T EXIST. Then, they hung up on me my first call and never answered my second call. 35 minutes on hold to get nothing done is unacceptable.",0
Please stay away from att. We've been with them for years and decided to do the phone upgrade. We'll they have a program that if you trade in old phones it will take off some from the new so we did 2 phones. We'll it been taking off for 1 phone but not the other. So when we seen it was not pulling the money off and did the math it about $300 so far that had not came off. We contacted them a d they seen the problem and tried to use everything they could to not credit my account. So we are getting a new provider. Fu k them and so now they say we see the issue but only can give $100 but not the $ 300. They can just send me my old phone that was in perfect shape back. Please stay away from these lieing thieves.,0
At&t has to be the most garbage phone service out of all them. I never have service anywhere. I'm a truck driver and I can't play my game on the network because it don't work nowhere it lies and says it's 5g but only cover 10% of the country sorry ass service but have the nerve to charge an arm and leg for service. Metro PCS has better service than this sorry ass service I'm switching back to tmobile at least they work mostly everywhere I go. I'm always dropping calls or losing signal everyday even in major cities. I don't recommend them for anything,0
Worst home Inet service ! Do not subscribe,0
"It is difficult to distinguish AT&T from typical scammers. They use the same tactics. Their representatives flat out lie. They create a problem, then it takes hours to resolve. Their reps seem to have a goal to take as much of our time as possible. They ask the same questions repeatedly. They ooze fake empathy and politeness to an astronomically kafkaesqe level. This has always been a horrible company. From the time when they rented Princess Phones till now. Yuk!",0
We have been loyal customers for over 5 years my husband’s name is on the account and passed away 5 months ago since that time I have tried to get his line shut off to no avail from them telling me the passcode is incorrect when in fact it wasnt to giving me a fictional number stating that this was the CEOs number. i cant even get a bill as to when the bill is do as they wont switch it over what POS company this is and of course lets not forget their data leak to the dark web,0
"Prepaid account support is bad. I had a trip to Europe and was advised by att support to add travel add-on for the countries that ended up not covered at all.I specifically asked for data coverage in those countries and once I got there I had no service or data at all. After spending 2 hours trying to get a refund, I was told mby one of the representatives that their system doesn’t allow refunds ! Then why spend 2 hours looking into this issue then?? Just wanted to let everyone know that their roaming data is not reliable and too expensive, just get local eSIM cards or portable WiFi devices instead when traveling abroad.",0
The worst possible customer service I have ever experienced.  They didn't even try to help me,0

"If it were possible to give ZERO stars I would. I have been with AT&T for over 17 years, all of my systems run through AT&T including every phone in my house, internet, cable, camera's, gaming systems, computers etc. EVERYTHING. However, that matters NOT to them. I am one tiny customer in the grand scheme of things and will not hurt their money in the slightest therefore they don't feel it necessary to do right. I have never asked for ANYTHING from AT&T. This 1 time after 17 years I don't have service at my job which requires me to use my cell phone. All my calls keep dropping on clients. I asked them about a booster. I was told by a rep that I would not be charged for the device. Then I get transferred to the person who can set that up and mail that out to me. This person then tells me it's $299. When I tell him what I was told, he transferred me to the Loyalty department. This lady told me they would listen to the call and if that was what was said to me they would mail it out to me but to give them 5 business days to do so (I told them it was the last 3 sentences at the end of the call - exactly where to listen at the exact moment it was said). I call today and they tell me they determined I was not told it would be at no charge which is a complete LIE! I was planning on paying originally.. then I was happy to hear it would be for free (without even asking!) so why the heck would I make that up?? At this point it's principle to be promised 1 thing when $299 is not even pennies to this company! I am changing to Verizon TODAY because that provider have service at my job and they refuse to do the right thing. Unbelievable!",0
"recently received notice my wireless bill will increase by 20.00 (note 20 year ATT customer)  when i called to inquire i was told they no longer offer the plan i was grandfathered into but i could switch to another plan for less with paperless billing and auto pay i explained i am not comfortable with auto pay to a company who has been breeched more than once.  i was basically told ""oh well""  you would think that ATT with be more considerate of their long-term customers as a result i will be canceling my account by years end.  once again ATT puts profit over customers",0
"So I learned a lesson. Yes, you will get a $5/month latest iPhone BUT AT&T owns you. You will NEVER own your phone meaning if you travel you can’t put a eSIM card in your phone unless you have fully paid for the phone. You think that’s reasonable? Not quite. Once your phone is paid for, AT&T must unlock the phone you fully paid for. You think that’s easy? Not at all. You will call their customer service and you’ll spend at least 30 minutes on the phone to someone who will tell you to do take all these steps and take zero responsibilities when it doesn’t work. So buy your phone with Apple, it’s more monthly but the phone is immediately unlocked, you actually own what you pay for.",0
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service!! Extremely disappointed with AT&T, and  we have loyal ties to this company that go back decades. When the high speed internet fiber optics became available in our neighborhood we switched. Big mistake.We will be without internet for more than a week by the time someone will get here to repair the problem. We keep receiving calls that postpone the repair. I realize these are first world issues, but we were told that they would come right out if we ever had problems with our service when we signed up with them. Sadly, not true.",0
This companies customer service SUCKS!!!!!!!!1 hour to renew my subscription what In the natural F*%k,0
Telling a customer you will not attempt to fix the problem without billing you is outrageous.  Having to spend 5 hours on the phone trying to speak to anyone who can help you is just silly.  Having to spend hours to even cancel account...,0
I’ve been an AT&T customer for over 50 years. NO MORE. Thanks to AT&T my social security number is all over the dark web. When are giants like AT&T going to start caring about their customers’ privacy. They are just shrugging off their incompetence and couldn’t care less about the injuries they are inflicting on tens of millions of hard working Americans who trusted them to protect the data they forced us to provide. Yet John Stankey is still the CEO of AT&T and is still “earning” a whopping $24.5 million dollars a year as a bonus for spitting on us. Why is Congress investigating everyone except for the real perpetrators of crime on Americans? I’ll tell you why - it’s called campaign contributions. And how is AT&T compensating us for its criminal negligence in gifting my personal data to thugs? They just raised my rate by $300 a year. SCREW JOHN STANKEY -just like he did to me.,0
"When I tell you, I’m extremely upset and frustrated when it comes to AT&T and a customer service center versus the AT&T stores or headquarters where you purchase merchandise I’m extremely upset that they do not be on the same page when it comes to customer service versus a AT&T store I’m extremely upset because of the advertising that the store representatives give you in order to purchase a new phone or tablet or etc.. I’m extremely upset that the information That was Gave to me about upgrading my daughter iPhone 11 was completely wrong and fast advertised to me in order to get the upgrade. This how it happened my phone was glitching really bad so I called to get it fixed. They told me she had an upgrade on that Pacific phone and line number in order for me to get the upgrade. I will have to pay the sales tax which was fine which so I paid the sales tax, they told me after I paid the sales tax. The phone was out of stock so I had to wait 7 to 10 business days to get that 60 something back and that I could go to one of the AT&T sites to purchase the phone inside of the store so I proceeded to do that  to the store the representative customer service agent at the store told me again. I see some information about a upgrade that you qualify for and I said yes my daughter phone is glitching. I wanted to get it fixed to keep it, but they said she had an upgrade for this Pacific line and Phone , he said yes that’s correct. She can get the iPhone 15 Pro. You just have to pay the sales tax so I’m like again, but I haven’t been refunded the sales tax that I just paid to come here to get the phone so so I paid again got the phone. He helped me  with transferring all her information pictures etc. so then he hit me with since you got this phone. You qualify for an iPad generation or you have to do today is pay the sales tax in order to receive it and pay off overtime on installments. just like the iPhone 15 so I paid I believe 60 something again for the sales tax he said the iPhone 15 installments I believe $15 monthly and the iPad is $34 monthly including the monthly bills so he said only thing you should see on your bill is 45 more dollars On your bill cycle, we waive the activation fee, etc. so so I asked again are you sure this the only thing I’m going to see when my bill come y’all advertise me before that’s how I open these lines a couple years ago due to advertising and he said I’m sorry you experienced that ma’am but yes, I’m sure I said OK. Let’s wrap things up, so he help me set up the iPad generation Connecting all my information on it from my phone, which I appreciated that so I left the store about a month later, I got the bill when I tell you my bill was ridiculous. Had all these fees a couple $80 fees each a couple activation fees might be it was like possibly $250 more than what it normally be so I called to ask what is all of this about what is going on why is all these fees on my bill Triple time this doesn’t make sense is what I told the representative so he tried to make it make sense to Why These fees and these larger amounts is on there, but it still don’t add up and it still don’t make sense And y’all still falsely advertising again to get To get the upgrade and the iPad so I still end up paying the $250 on my bill making my bill 600 and something dollars which I still feel like I need my money back because I was overly charged heavily And come to find out they added another line to my bill without my knowledge so is that not advertising where did the other line come from and how did it get here? So I called AT&T instead of going in the store. The agent on the phone told me I had another line opened when I got the upgrade in order for me to get the upgrade. I had to open up a new line. My mouth dropped wide open like what do you mean I opened the new line? I didn’t consent to open a new line. I wasn’t even told that in order for me to get the upgrade. I had to open a new line. I was told that the iPhone 11 already had an upgrade on it to receive, so that’s what I initially did and was told I did so once again where did this line come from and why was I lied to in order for you to make profit so now I’m stuck with this line that I didn’t ask about to receive and how did my upgrade on the phone that I already have that’s already connected to service become A whole new line and in order for y’all to try to fix it y’all continue to lie and try to make it make sense to why it happened. That way there’s no reason it should’ve happened that way there’s no reason told me in order for me to get upgrade, I had to open a new line, no reason there’s no reason I wasn’t told that if y’all would’ve told me that to give me the option to weigh out myself, maybe I would’ve proceeded but y’all didn’t give me that option. Y’all lied to me and Falsely advertised me for the second time And hear my bill still coming in overly heavy and overly charging All because of knowledge I didn’t receive to weigh my options Highly upset Law",0
Thanks for the data breach and the prices that keep going up! I can’t wait to switch providers.,0
"I had no option for zero stars so they got one. I have been with AT&T 30 yrs and never switched. In Jan. I brought my business number over from comcast landline to att cellular. I’ve had this number for 35 years and is the only number for my business. They managed to set my account up totally wrong. I thought the payments were set up on autopay with my 5 other personal lines. Well it wasn’t and the account never received a payment. Then they shut service off in May. I received a collection bill in June. I never received a paper statement, email, text or phone call tellin me my account was in arrears. I didn’t realize service was shut out ff because 100% of my phone calls were forwarded to my personal line. After I paid the bill they told me to go into a store and activate my account. Well they gave my number away to some data plan. I asked if I could get my 30 yr old business number back and they said they can’t but offered me a $200 credit to activate a new line.",0
"Bad service, I called and they put hold for 2 hrs , man this is sad I switched from Verizon, they also lied and told me free international calls then charged me 700$ ,",0
"All I’m going to say is save your time save your stress save your energy and go with something, someone other than att lost $2000 worth of promotion discount and my iphone that I traded in. They said lost in mail or said I never sent it. Going with a prepaid small company would be 1000 times better. Horrible company. Get bough by someone else and fix yourself",0
"No wonder they have a 1.3 stars, it seems like they don’t care at all",0
I have been with AT&T for cell service for 2 years and I was told that if I upgraded my 5 phones I would get $700 as a trade in value but after we sent them in we only got $165.  Now my Sales Executive Customer Success Mobility person and his boss are not responding to me.  I have also asked about other charges on my bill and again no response.  I would never recommend using AT&T and will be switching from AT&T as soon as possible unless somebody at AT&T makes this situation right.,0
They had been charging me a year after i canceled my service. Please be careful with this service provider. they don't care and just take your money for nothing,0
"I have had an incredibly frustrating experience with my current cell phone provider. First, the sales representative misled me by saying that if I got two iPhone 14 Pro Maxes, I would get two additional iPhones for free for my kids. I was also switching from a different provider, and he assured me that my bill would only be $165. When I asked about settling my bill with the previous provider, he said not to worry and that they would handle it.For the first three months, everything seemed fine. However, I eventually noticed my bill had increased to $220. When I called customer service, they informed me that the previous lower amount was part of a promotion and that my regular payments for the Pro Max were now due. I begrudgingly accepted this.The situation worsened when I needed to travel. I inquired about unlocking my phone to receive business calls abroad and was told it would cost $10 per day. Despite paying this fee, the service was terrible and I continued to be charged.Two days ago, I received a call from a collections agency regarding an unpaid balance for the phones from my previous provider. I was under the impression that AT&T had taken care of this, but they explained how it actually works.I went online and noticed that I am being charged for 4 phones. When I called customer service, they informed me that they would only give me a $6 credit for each phone they received from us as a trade-in. Now, not only do I have to pay my previous cell provider $1,300, but I am also essentially paying for the phones all over again without any clear explanation from AT&T.",0
"Worst experience ever with a cell phone provider. Employees use boiler room con artist tactics including flat out lying to confuse senior citizens and sell them all kinds of garbage they don't need. Was there almost 6 hours, 4 of those spent with a new guy who didn't know what he was doing. We were sold DirecTV and internet and told we would have fiber optic cable service and didn't. We found out when the technician came to hook it up and told us it wasn't available in our apartment building. We were sold a 3rd phone which we didn't need and told it would save us money on insurance. The 3rd phone costs $64 per month and insurance is $30. Went back 2 weeks later and was told by the manager that the 2 guys who sold us everything had been let go and that there was nothing she could do to help us. Went back again because neither of us could make calls or send messages and the female manager who refused to help us and the 2 guys she said had been let go were all there. She was very nasty until she saw that I was recording the conversation. She then showed me how to resolve the issue. Went in again today to return the unwanted 3rd phone and was met by ""David, just David"" who grabbed my phone from the table and tried to turn the recording off. He said they don't allow recording in the store in spite of several cameras in full view. He refused to help me at all and asked me to leave. In summary the manager and the other 2 employees have no respect for seniors and take advantage of them as much as possible.",0
"I've been with At&t for over 15 years, my dad worked for them for almost 50 and I'm done! I feel scammed! I traded a paid for phone to them and now I'm stuck with a phone for 3 years! The non speaking English agent lied and said it was an even trade. I should own this phone! I'll never trust them again!",0
Bill keeps going up every month for no apparent reason- same usage!Junk fees keeps getting tacked on and getting hold of customer service has become very difficult.Their customer support is in the Philippines and you get the runaround.The representative gives you a plan and minutes later he says he couldn’t do it,0
"A list of issues with AT&T over the last 3 months, on a business account, across phone and 3 different in-person stores for service:- Added a new line when I ordered a replacement for a lost tablet rather than activating on the existing line.- Incorrectly added permissions for an account admin that limited access, requiring 3 separate phone calls to resolve.- Wouldn't cancel the line that was added incorrectly initially, requirig multiple phone calls and a store visit to reverse despite it very obviously being an AT&T mistake.- When adding 6 new tablets, would not add them over the phone. The in-store associate added them to a higher cost data plan and added insurance without permission, resulting in $270/month in extra charges if it hadn't been caught within a couple days.- Completely unable to upgrade devices, change plans, or update devices via the web portal, necessitating long phone calls with unhelpful reps or in-store visits where the reps try to scam you.in all, I've probably wasted 6-8 hours of time on activities that I should have been able to accomplish in 30 minutes via the web portal AND they tried to scam us for additional data/insurance fees.",0
"Only giving 1 star because I can’t give less. If you are older, or have older friends and family, I would highly recommend going with a service other than AT&T. My story is too long to tell in dealing with AT&T on behalf of an elderly family member, but to say the very least they took advantage of her on a fraudulent level. Please, please do your research and find a company you feel confident will take care of their customers.",0
"Absolute worst customer service! They are rude, cut you off while you're speaking and seem bothered that you're asking them to do their job. We have an issue getting numbers ported over and I was transferred back and forth between departments for over an hour! One woman answers, mumbles and talks over me and then transferred me back to the mainline. Once I get everything squared away I will never come back to AT&T. Also, let's not forget everyone's personal information being leaked on the dark web. You would think they would be working hard to retain customers.",0
"I am a business owner with multiple phones and Tablets and have been an AT&T customer for over 10 years.My complaint:Extremely hard to get any type of knowledgeable help to resolve billing issues.  Have made multiple calls over several days resulting in excessive hold times, calls misrouted, calls being disconnected while speaking to an agent, etc.  My experiences with this service provider over the last couple of years has been nothing short of a huge disappointment filled with regrets.",0
They service sucks and the people that work for this company!!!!! They are a rip off!!! They over charge for 💩 And double your bill!!!! Worst company service I ever delt with!!!! I recommend nobody switch to their company!!!!,0
"Absolute worst service and customer service I've ever received. They lie and steal. Never, ever use ATT. They lied to me about the service I would be able to get, messed up connecting my new devices. Customer service lines were absolutely dreadful. No one stateside to speak to and everyone else either couldn't understand me or I couldn't understand them. They wouldn't accept my proof of CNA to get discount. When I finally had enough a couple days in I was forced to call tmobile and get my service back with them. Still dealt with issues with ATT . I sent them back their phones and they tried to steal them and charge me $2200 for phones I gave them back. Called to resolve that issue and found they literally had my phones there in the warehouse that I had sent back to them but yet they still charged me?! Overdraft my account and I had to lock my bank account because they charged me all this 2 months after I had returned the phones. They offered no compensation, no fix for all my time wasted and all the lies. Just told me the charge would be reversed. Disgusting practices. Absolutely criminal. Do not use ATT",0
"AT&T line has been out at our condo building for 11 days. Our entry system and fire alarm work with this line. During the last 2 days I have been on the phone for 6 hours trying to get some help. It seems like I have spoken to half the folks in India. Twice during the process, I was promised a time when a tech would visit. Both times no one showed up. We are at risk here with the fire alarm inoperable but no one at AT&T cares, even under threat of legal acton.",0
If I could give them a zero I would!! I am 13 days behind on my bill. I don't have a pass due balance. They shut me off. They refuse to work with me. In two days I was able to pay them. They refused a payment arrangement and to turn my phone back on. They are worst then comcast!!!,0
I shut off my service. Transferred two of four numbers and paid off my contract.The store did not tell me I had to contact the “loyalty” dept. To shut off the other two numbers.They also did not give me guidance on how to unlock the phone. I had to purchase another phone and they pulled 200 more out of my account.Said I had to pay 98.00 for two lines unusedI told them that I had an 800 credit score. That wasn’t going to take me out.But they said I could have went on vacation for a month and not used the phone. 🙄,0
I went into att to switch carriers. I had to put my information in 3 different times each time requiring a verification with their fraud department. The first time the fraud department said I did not have to give a deposit I said ok then they said I had to do the process over again. The fraud department then said I had to put down $1000 I said fine. Then they said I had to do the process over again which made no sense. The third time I had to go through the fraud department again which said I had to put down a 3000 deposit for two phones costing 1400. I was not going to pay 3000 for phones. We went through the entire process and when I agreed they said we had to do it again three times in a row going from no deposit to 1000 deposit then 3000 deposit. It made absolutely no sense and wasted 6 hours of my time. The employees in the store told me that the fraud department do not speak to eachother and they can tell you something contradictory to one anotherr. At the end of the day I wasted a day and a half in what I can only describe as a bizarre experience. After which I went to Verizon and within 45 minutes I received both phones and a smart watch with no money down. After reading different reviews on here I feel Ive dodged a bullet by not signing with att.,0
If I could give a 0 I would for Att Bussness department they have been dragging there feet with getting my number all the way to a cell phone for over a month and have been pulling me around like a rag doll dealing with there business department is not worth it if you need a business like just put a second like on your customer account I strongly suggest staying away from there business department also dong expect to get fiber even if you have a fiber optic terminal pole in your yard from Att becausei still haven’t got it even tho I have had a pole ac fiber lines for over a year ran,0
I called them to figure out what was wrong with my bill had bogus charges on try to take care of it when manager said My money was unhonest I would not give them one star but I had to,0
Worst company to deal withDon't join them you will sorry. They are charging me for a bad phone they sent,0
"Service is in and out. Signed up for $50 with autopay, they then turn off paperless billing so they can charge you $100 a month",0
"Customer service absolutely sucks. Their service is horrible no matter where I go. I lose my connection.  I’ll be in the middle of a call and it just drops I try to call people it says call Failed. I’m sorry I ever left Verizon to come to AT&T, but I’m happy to say Today is my last day with them. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere if you’d like to be able to have a phone conversation with someone",0
Worst company EVERRRRRRR. No stars but they wouldn't let me comment with one!!   WORST!!!!  THEY WILL SCREW YOU BAD!!!!,0
"The most abysmal phone service on the planet: overpriced- monthly payments equal to a car payment; unreliable 5G service with barely 1 bar (4G was much better); constant security breaches (terrible security system); and deplorable customer service. They could have done it right, but chose poorly!",0
"I waited for almost 30 minutes with 1 girl helping another couple. She never said a word to me the entire time. Then in walks a.man with food. He walks to the back stays gone a few minutes then comes to help me. He was extremely rude as I told him I was glad he was there as I've been waited almost 30 minutes. He said no...nore like 25. I took my phone and said I'll go elsewhere. He said we'll thus is MY store and I replied that I was HIS customer. He was rude, arrogant and looked like he was on something.",0
"Well ATT raised my monthly payment to 106 up 12 dollars with no reason, no added benefits. called att about this which of course i had to speak to someone who could not speak actual english, he tells me my bill after linking 2 family members would be 133.42 plus tax.get an email my bill is 455.72after cslling again they say that is not applying credits so the bill would be 199.45. i asked about the 133.42 i was told before, they put me in hold and after 15 to 20 minutes say they got it to 133.42.get another email saying the bill is 255.72.called again speaking to another person who can't speak englishthey screw it up again.avoid this place at all cost!!!!",0
"AT&T, a long time trusted icon of America itself, has been taken over by someone which I don't even have words for now. Making AT&T, bar none, the most crooked, and the most in-accessable, major Corporation existing on planet Earth. Leave AT&T quickly. Forget the name. It's not that name anymore. At least, that's my personal opinion.",0
"Terrible customer service waited 45 mins never got help ,seems like no actual people work there, just computers and robots",0
"Out of 7,037 reviews, AT&T has a combined score of 1.3. I'm sure the score would be even lower if they allowed a ""ZERO"" to be entered. Count me as one of the many potential customers who would give AT&T a ZERO if possible. The customer service is HORRIBLE. Over the course of 24 hours, as I waited for a missed installation window, I was lied to 3 times by 3 different customer service representatives who who are about as worthless as a hole in a pair of socks. I am currently looking for another company to provide internet at my business so that I will no longer have to EVER do business with AT&T again.",0
"ATT is aweful. I have 5 lines or so for over a decade and they are only getting worse as time progresses. The entire inferstructure for cellular data is owned and built by tmobile anyway, so you might as well not support a bunch of incompetent 3rd party tower leeches to analyse your data (which they profit from) just to connect you to a service that is available from tmobile( who also profit for all your personal data). Is TMobile any better? No. Not really. But seeing as how  att isnt even nessessarry, they are as cocky and putrid as should be expected. They can possibly issue refunds in 3 to 6 weeks but they cant give you back your time and effort and mental stability, not that they would even if they could. Their apps for security are depricated before you even download them, they charge for services they dont provide and they cost cut by routing all your issues as customers to non us based call support. Sound fun? No?",0
"Was quoted a monthly bill of $100 from costco. First bill was 240, second was 98 third was 150. The sales people lie to you. The customer service people don't speak english. WORST experience ever! STAY AWAY FROM AT&T.",0
"I am utterly disappointed with AT&T and regret choosing them as my service provider. The service has been nothing short of a hassle, largely due to their misleading advertisements and hidden fees. Initially, the plan seemed reasonably priced, but soon after, I noticed unexpected charges creeping onto my bill. These fees were never mentioned during the sales process, and every attempt to resolve this confusion with customer service led to more frustration due to their lack of clarity and assistance.Moreover, their lock-in plan has been a major inconvenience, especially as someone who travels frequently. I was shocked to discover that unlocking my phone for international use required an additional payment of $1000 to switch to an international e-SIM. This policy was neither clearly communicated at the outset nor does it seem reasonable or customer-friendly.Overall, AT&T’s approach feels deceitful and customer-unfriendly, focusing more on trapping consumers with hidden costs rather than providing transparent and reliable service. I cannot recommend AT&T to anyone, and I advise potential customers to consider other providers who value customer satisfaction and transparency.",0
so bad and so slow internet,0
"These guys are robbers, please be careful before signing a contract with them",0
Customer service is terrible.  They only care about their commission.,0
"I really dislike Customer Service of At&t. Ever since they outsource. Took me a month and half and 6 phone calls, 9 hours talking to someone, just to get a return label. To return a phone!",0
10 years as a costumer with them they decided to sell Att Puerto Rico and they wanted me to change  the number or I was going to loose it. They was going to give me a credit of 65 dollars when I was certain comfortable with my number for the las 20 years. They took a unit on trade in for a 23 ultra and since they was gonna give up or sell my number to the new carrier also took my trade in value which it was supposed to applied to the ultra they never applied and now they want me to pay $945 in order to unlocked the phone. They are really something special. I will not recommend them ever.,0
"I signed up for AT&T Business Hotspot in December of 2023. They told me it would be $45/month.The device never arrived, but I still got a bill for the service in Jan 2024. I called and they said they corrected it, but then I got another bill for over $300 in February. I called again, apparently they never canceled the plan from the device that never arrived. But they said they fixed the problem and assured me the price had been adjusted to the $45 agreed upon in December.Fast forward another 4 months, I've been on the phone with them every month because they are charging my account the incorrect amount plus hundreds of dollars in ""past due"" fees. Each time I'm on hold for 3+ hours and about 40% of the time they hang up mid conversation. Ultimately the bill is never corrected, even in the 3 instances in which I had written communication stating that they would change the bill.I'm currently on the phone trying to cancel my account. They have hung up on me twice now...I would not recommend them for business internet service.",0
Att sucks and att customer service is worthless,0
"I hate this company.  Last month they had 52 bucks of my money sitting on my account and wasn't going to apply it to anything telling me that they don't know why I paid it and my bill wasn't due. Then I pay 70 bucks thinking it was to the internet since the link said internet but guess what! It was to the wireless and now my internet is off, and after explaining to the rep. What took place, it's my fault because I paid with speed pay on their app. Are you serious.  So now when they return my money, my services still won't be restored because now since the services are suspended I can no longer do a split payment. Are you kidding me! I'm 🏃‍♀️ back to xfinity!!!! Listening to other people about cheaper services shoot I rather pay 220 dollars a month for faster service,  better customer service,  and payment extensions. I can't wait to cut AT&T off. Plus I can't never get anyone that speaks fluent English it just bothers me I have to repeat myself over and over, then they cut me off when I'm talking, then I can't understand them. I'm just over it. Never again!!",0
I give it a zero the past 3 weeks My internet has been out more than it ran. They tell me there and outage evey time but I still have to pay my bill.

Billing cycle started over on the 14th and I canceled on the 16th. I'm sure the ""no prorate"" was in the contract I signed back in the 1990's but that is just bad service.

"Three year business contract, was told it would be 2 years, locked in and no vacation mode, can only suspend service while continuing to pay full price. Verizon offers vacation mode along with everyone else. We’ve had nothing but problems, service never works, no credits given, and are now forced to buy out early and lose our phone numbers that were ours before att. Do not use ATT. The worst 2 years of phone service I’ve ever experienced, and our information was released in their data breach, again with no compensation.",0
"For years second time in less than a month my internet service has failed. Yesterday afternoon, July 17 my home Wi-Fi, (29512) AT&T internet air stopped working.  Their app said service would be restored by 2 am central time. This morning the app claims it will be restored within 24 hours. It hard to see how AT&T takes the needs of their customers seriously in providing such unreliable and inconsistent information. It is suggested that the review should be helpful - do your job.",0
The worst internet provider. I don’t know what incompetent fiber or cable dudes they have working in the oak hill Texas area but my WiFi has been out for 7 days and they’ve had today at 10 as when it would be back. They then changed it to next 24 hours. Now it’s for Friday at 3. Hope yall figure this out and give me my money back for all the time I’ve lost. Will be canceling asap,0
Worst experience ever. 4 hrs to change a plan. Then nothing at the end. Trying to route to phone line or store and when we goto store  they say call phone number and nobody can do anything. Pathetic customer service and nobody cares.,0
My son just shipped out to boot camp for the marines.  i was told when i set up his account that i could reduce his rate while he was gone by simply calling after he left.  i called and was told that boot camp did not qualify for a reduced rate.  only active duty and INCARCERATED PERSONS!  so basically what AT&T is telling me is that a CONVICTED FELON has more priority as a customer than a military recruit.  way to be behind your country AT&T,0
"I have been calling ATT for over a week about my bill. I’ve waited on hold over an hour more than once. I cannot get a representative on the phone. I’ve gone to my local store for help. They were sure that they could help me, but also could not get billing on the phone. I was told that I’d have to drive to a corporate store to resolve this. This is horrible customer service.",0
"My dad and I went to AT & T to upgrade my phone, and the girl working there told my dad that since he is a first responder he can get an iPad and a watch included in our plan and that our bill would actually be less each month. Instead it was $177 MORE and now we’re all having issues with our phones. We got completely scammed by a company we have been with for 20 years!! I called and spoke to representative Ratisha and she said that we can’t return anything because it’s been past 2 weeks. We didn’t get the bill until 30 days to find out they LIED about about them being free. The iPad and watch haven’t even been used yet! 20 years and still got totally scammed. I’ll never trust this company again. We will be changing services after vacation and I will spread the word that their representatives lied about their first responder program to us and now will not let us return the  unopened items. Also, apparently there is no management to talk to on the phone which is such a red flag. If you’re deciding between services, do not pick AT & T",0
"WORST EVER!! Tech has been out 4 times, problem not fixed. Tech called today and said his supervisor told him not to do anything,  that they could not fix the problem with my fixed wireless internet. That's it, no remedy, no option...nothing! Canceled my account. Been without internet service for 3 weeks, this is the worst company I've ever dealt with. Will never do business with them again.",0
"Double charged me $60 for a returned check fee for not updating bank account and never tried to contact me to update my payment information. After wasting much of my time they removed one returned check fee of $30. Sorry, I can not help that this is a worker country and I have to work and have no time to take care of business, family, or friends",0
"Be carefull with at&t!! They are liars. First they tell you you will get a credit regarding the X issue, that you should see it reflected on the next billing cycle. Months go by and is never apply. When you call them regarding the credit, they asked you ""what was it about?"" like they know nothing. Case starts over and same situation... months go by and nothing, you call again.... At&t play games with customers. Very unprofessional and careless company.",0
HiI am very disappointed by my billing this month I have paid $137 of my two cellphones which I don't understandMy bill supposed to be $100 which was committed by your sales person.You customers services are not serious to help your customers.So plz fix my billRegardsKashif,0
Att worst company  ever  went on vacation for 7days come back $1500 phone change. Just for roaming.High way robbery.They offer free phone to trade your old phone but they lock you to 36 months contract.  Scammers  AT&T HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO  CUSTOMERS,0
AT@T I haven't ever had so much trouble than with this company I switched thinking it would be better I was so wrong first week there phone service went down for a day of two now people are able to steal are phone numbers and my phones been acting up all the way around not a good company,0
"Since I bought AT&T I have had hundreds of problems with overcharges, they remove and add charges as they pleaseThe worst option is to acquire a contract for 3 years, those are three years that you will constantly be fighting for additional charges",0
"Aside from the rising costs over the years, the extreme “legalese” in superfine print no one has time to read when time to replace an aging phone, as well as the questionable practices regarding the AT&T insurance and submitting claims, and sales reps that may need additional training in communications, dealing with call centers that may not have clear insight on local issues – my recent issue begins with the mistake of upgrading to a Samsung Fold Z4 shortly after it became available.While the phone was impressive in terms of the screen size, it came with many more “unknown” cons I would learn about the hard way, than pro’s. Although Samsung boasts waterproof/resistant, it is not dustproof. Amazing that a speck of dust can create havoc on the screen rendering it unreadable at a significant pace and hence I had to replace it after 7(?) months or so…while I had insurance on all my devices had to shell out another 700.00+ to get the replacement. Ok, lesson learned, be sure to create a good seal around the folding part.In May of 2024  (with another 18 months of installment payments left), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth stopped working entirely and despite many attempts and online research to fix on my own, had no other choice but to get a replacement phone. I  did not want to deal with a claim at the time due to the frustration of already having to replace again and of course work and life. Went back to the AT&T store and explained the situation and wound up with a new phone and a new business line I did not need, it was not clear to me that although I brought the old phone in  at the time that I would be  stuck with paying installments on both. Again, I was not paying attention as the frustration just grew – especially after there happened to be a Samsung rep in the store and when the sales person asked him if it was common that the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would stop working and he shook his head rather non-chalantly and that is when I popped up and advised that is not what I discovered in various online sites – Samsung for one - regarding a known issue with the fold.Once I discovered I am still paying for the Fold, I called AT&T and an hour of wasted effort, I was referred to the claim site and here is where it gets really interesting. The Fold no longer showed up as a registered device so I could not file a claim… AT&T rep on the phone had me register the phone with my true number associated and I asked if that was going to impact my current working phone and basically had me attempt to claim on both phones… I can’t make this stuff up folks, simply unreal. I then went back to the store to see if the claim can be done from there and was told of course they could help. Only issue is the phone had been turned off for a bit so now it was not showing up on the network and when I asked how to do that as the phone did not work… no Wi-Fi – the salesperson asked her co-worker and he would not even respond to me which is ok, but stated to put a sim in the phone and make a few calls, etc…Went home and tried it and guess what? Still not showing up on network and now the screen appears to be damaged again… and growing. At this point, not sure if it is worth my peace to deal with this and just eat the cost. Moral of the story is check everything including the fine print, question all policies, particularly the insurance policies and whatever deductibles you are responsible for, and have a backup plan. My plan involves fulfilling my debt obligations on these phones and once they are paid for, removing all services I have with AT&T after many years as my provider and never doing business with AT&T again…Hope this helps in some way.",0
If it had 0 star I would give zero. This. Is the worst internet service provider. Practically a scam. They will lure you saying there are no hidden fees when later the bios will be 300-400 $ and when asked they will ssay its activation fees. They also told me that they will give me healthcare discount but later said not eligible and charged me extra. They also said in the beginning that they will give 50$ gift hard. That's the biggest scam and don't fall for that because i never received when I called and asked they said it will take 3-4 months to arrive. They are totally scaming people into getting their wireless service saying there are so many discount when you're joining and later on there is nothing. I called them to remove my activation fees but they did not. Instead ileach time the bills become higher and higher. I hope everyone is safe away from att,0
No disrespect to att cuz sometimes the speeds are good but wth is up with these speeds it was pretty solid 9-12 ping and. Now it 75-245 this is some 💩 experience,0
"AT&T SUCKS!! They moved us off our landline to their VOIP satellite service supposedly because we are in a rural area of Kansas.  PROMISED better service, blah, blah, blah.  We've had intermittent phone service for months, and have spent weeks and our time trying to call and connect with a desk than can help.  EVERBODY passes us on to the next desk telling us it's not their area of responsibility.  Seriously, we waited and listened to elevator music for an hour and 50 minutes before somebody would actually pick up only to be told we were being transferred directly to a desk.  Yeah, right.  Another hour of listening to elevator music and no help.  AVOID AT&T at all costs!!",0
"I broke my arm and had to have surgery. Needless to say, my mind was preoccupied. While I was in the mitz of preparing for surgery my home internet was suspended. I forgot to pay my monthly bill. My apology. I received no notification reminder that payment was due. When I tried to check my AT&T email for messages using my mobile phone using my data I no longer had access to the emails. Yes, not only did I not have no internet, I also could not use their email platform.",0
"Att customer service has directly lied 3 times to me,  3 phone calls over in 2 months. I've learned something new every time. All I tried to do is enroll in auto pay.

I don't understand how a big company can be this bad.",0
"Me and my wife got two new phones at at&t and an i pad. Our payments were like 350 a month for everything, but we expected that. Then a random apple watch got added to the bill and now theyre trying to charge us 550 a month and customer service hangs up everytime we call. Every single time.",0
Service is always out been having trouble for 2 weeks now but they still want you to pay when there Service is mostly down going to try to find better service,0
"Absolutely worst customer service I've ever experienced.  My 70 year old mother many calls because their employee that messed up my mother account when they sent her to our home 4 months , still no resolution follow up or apology.  I'm will never recommend Att . I was involved in the Att data breach. Nothing but immigrants very incompetent POS . They are the Absolutely worst.

"Absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. Misinformation galore.

"AT&T is the worst cell phone provider imaginable! The rates are high, and there is no customer service. I was on hold for more than an hour with three callbacks, and every time the line went dead before an agent could answer. Five new cell phones were sent to my house without requiring a signature and, unsurprisingly, were stolen from the porch. AT&T refused to reimburse the down payment even though a police report was filed. I would never recommend AT&T to anyone!",0
"Worst customer support I've ever received. They signed us up in the middle of target, wasted hours of time, and then when we finally get home, we realize they did it all wrong. Waste of time, terrible company.",0
I am very pissed right now. We went on a cruise and there was no service. The cruise charged us 5 dollars for the internal message system. Just message through the cruise app. Nothing to do with att. The second day on the cruise was my husband’s birthday. So att send us a message that you can pay 25$ a day to have a service. My husband paid for one day so he could respond to all the birthdays messages he received. My daughter and I didn't even use our phone the whole trip. It was our way to live in the moment and be away from the phone. And now back home we received a bill and att charged each of us $125 so a total of 375 and say that we used our phone!!! My husband called them but they do not want to understand. He is going through cancer right now and said he is tired and do not want to fight with them and say he will paid and want peace of mind. I think it is not fair at all. We did not even use our phone and to be charge this amount! We being with att since 10years !! That is not fair.,0
"If travelling to the US and needing a pre-paid plan, Do not buy AT&T’s. It is complicated to set up and there is no customer support.

"These guys really dragged me through hell, couldn't port my number over, even though they tried several times. The guy at the at&t store was a totally rude jerk and flat out told me that they ""weren't going to sell me a phone "" I have outstanding credit and no criminal background. Go anywhere but here for service of any kind.",0
Have be att  uverse customer since it started but they are discontinuing this so the go up on price to get you to drop it. This sh**was not that good lately but u don’t have many choices.

"My ATT wireless bill went up 30 bucks and according to them there will be credits applied to my next bill. It's always something with these people. I was sold into the service on the pretense of saving me money and I should have known they were lying form the start. I went with wireless along with home phone ,internet and cable. 3 separate bills and has me questioning my decisions. Just as soon as this 24 month deal is up I'm switching back. This is utterly ridiculous. ATT tou suck.. .",0
Absolutely deplorable internet. I've tried everything from reconnecting the router to moving it closer to changing it 2.4 from 5.0ghz nothing works it's safe to say that this is the most utterly disgusting internet service I've had in a long time GO SCREW YOURSELF ATT,0
Person In charge of us 'mat' was disrespectful arrogant and overall had terrible customer service skill 0/100 would never use at&t customer service again,0
Worst service I’ve ever had to experience in my 56 years on this planet. It took almost ten minutes to load into this website and write a review in my own home. I constantly have issues loading things and doing things on my phone whether im in my own home or the middle of no where the service is relatively the same. Thanks AT&T for ruining 2 years of my life👍.,0
YOU would have to be really STUPID to use at&t service for anything. You are very likely to be scammed and or your identity stolen and you bank robbed of your money. VERY unreliable internet service. The phone service is lousy and a ripoff with the I-Phone. Makes me believe that their only striving for the phone gamers and stupid people for their service to survive.,0
I can see why AT&T is the worst company for direct tv and any phone services! Your information is compromised and they could care less! This crap happened over a year ago and the news media is the only confirmation! When I called to cancel they hung up and had to go through another fourty five minutes to talk to clueless staff and still charging me an early termination fee! So if you like wasting money? AT&T is your place!,0
"Have not been happy so I switched to AT&T the phone I switch I can’t return if I could I would switch back cricket now I went to get a new screen, but I was cracked. They told me it was going to be free when I got my phone a couple months ago. It cost me $10. I feel like they lie all the time. Tell me my phone bill every $75. It’s now 95 When I switched, it was $92",0
"ATT decided to raise their rates due to ""global Inflation"" as the customer service reps indicated. I changed my autopay to bank account in order to get my internet price to what I was originally billed for but it kept defaulting to my credit card info for autopay. I called ATT but the customer service rep refused to help me. He said he couldn't change the bill to my original price even though I changed my autopay to my bank account. I'm not sure how he couldn't help, or maybe he didn't want to help but I ended up cancelling ATT once my current billing cycle is over. I'm switching to Xfinity for $30/month for 2 years as I only use internet for surfing the web and for sending emails. ATT sucks big time. They keep raising prices while other competitors like Xfinity has promotions all the time. At least Xfinity wants to secure new clients for their business. ATT has no desire to keep their existing customer base. Raising prices isn't helping their business at all.",0
AT&T has an incorrect email and incorrect phone number on file for me to access any kind of change to my account. They put yahoo instead of gmail and they have my moms number. How does this make sense. They said I have to go in person.,0

"Would be a 0 have been on repair hold for over 3 hours now over a broken wire at my parents house. I have been given 4 different numbers to call and back to second number. At att they have no clue how to treat a customer. I can wait my turn but this is definitely the corporate run around.

I have over months of proof that my watch was bot activated properly after being in the store several times complaining but yet still being charged.

He didn't care I had an serious issue and that I was just wasting money on a serive that never worked. Ashley, help but you can tell she didn't want to help. She didn't greet me and hung in our faces when she completed the transaction.  If you do t like your job....GET A DIFFERENT ONE!",0
I have been with att over 20 years. I upped my internet to fiber 1000 about 2 years ago. Found out right before hurricane Beryl the the router I have doesn’t even handle fiber1000. So they have been charging me for 2 years for a service I couldn’t even use. When I call about this all the guy wanted to do was sell me a new phone or change my service to “save me money”. He harassed and badgered me until I agreed to a so called better plan which isn’t even close. To the plan I had when I realized this I called back to get my original plan only to find my old plan was a grandfathered plan they don’t offer anymore and it was too late. I am over att. When I finally get internet again I will find a new provider. And I will keep their equipment until make things right for the 2 years I paid for a service I didn’t receive!!,0
"I am the managing partner of a movie cinema in St. Louis.  We called twice today due to no internet connectivity.  We were told there is an outage and the issue would be corrected by the end of the day.  It's now almost 9:30pm (11.5 hours later) and we still do not have internet connectivity.  As a BUSINESS, we are critically dependent on internet connectivity.  The majority of our ticket sales are generated ONLINE.  We lost a lot of money today due to AT&T's inability to restore connectivity.  I wish I could say this is the first time we had significant issues with AT&T, but it's not.  AT&T is simply not a reliable provider.  Not for business.  Not for residential.  We are likely going to switch to Spectrum.",0
"I had to return a product. Their store in the mall would not take it back because it was purchased online. Their website had almost zero info re returns. Finally, I figured out that I had to call them. So I called them. After 54 minutes on the phone, I got a woman (somewhere in Asia) who managed to disconnect me after putting me on hold. It was a simple request I had for her to send a shipping slip but oh now, she could not figure out how to do that and got my number to call me back just in case. She never did. She just disconnected me. I had to call again. Another hour and no-one answered the call. This is a company that does not care about its customers.",0
"I opened with att in May 2024 transferred from Verizon wireless. ATT sale agent said that she takes waiver the activation charges for 4 lines and other discounts. But att charged over $356.00 in June 2024. I kept call att and emailed her the charges. She said that it would credit back to me in June or July 2024, but not that credit back to me. I called & emailed both her and her supervise/manager, but no responses and not fixed it. It’s totally lied to me. I am upset and so forth, so I will move att to different carrier in July or soon.",0
I have had nothing but problems with AT&T and I have given them years to fix it. They did good from about 2006-2019 but lately nothing but problems!!! For starters I had to get an upgrade due to my battery not charging...get the upgrade wont send/receive calls or texts. Then they send me an insurance replacement and charge me $350.00 NOT HAPPY as my phone was still under warranty and when I called to dispute the charge they said to talk to Assurion....Well Assurion informed me it was a manufacturers default and I should not have to pay. So I have spent the last 3 days trying to get in contact with AT&T and the agents always push me on to somebody else that I have to explain everything all over. So after more than a total of 4 hours on hold and explaining myself I had to put in for a call back for today and as soon as the agent said Hello and I said hello back she hung up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Been with att maybe 15yrs now and I'm really considering going with tmobile in or another internet provider. Last friday my internet went out at my home so I called tech support and after 3 attempts to troubleshoot the issue I was told a tech would have to come out. The only day available was Tuesday between 8am and 12pm. So I had to wait 4days with no service. When Tuesday came it was 11am I received a text from att stating that the tech is running behind and couldn't make the 12 o'clock window. At 2:30pm I called customer service for a ept and they couldn't provide one and just asked me to give the tech a few more hrs and they'll be there. No one ever showed up. Called customer service the next day only to be told some one would be out friday. A whole week with no service.,0
"Disrespectful employees, supervisors rude, no one has been able to rectify my issue.  Transferred 5 time and the last request was for supervisor , no resolve.

When I leave that service I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  And will never refer anyone to them.",0
"I made a payment on 6/27 and they put it on someone else's account. I have spent days upon stays and hours upon hours trying to fix this.  2 times at&t requested a transfer and could not do it due to not having a read to this other persons account.   They ask me for their passcode.  It’s not my account,  how would I have access.  They say it is not their fault because I paid on the phone.  Are you kidding me,  that number is the number you gave to me on the email to call.   Once I pay off this phone,  I will never use their service again. At&y is horrible at customer service.  T-mobile’s actual service is not as good, however they bend over backward to keep you happy when they mess up.  I miss T-MOBILE AND WILM RUN BACK AS SOON AS I can.  AT&T you are so disorganized.  You could not find my payment twice even with my confirmation number you guys emailed me.  You emailed me the transfer was successful and it was not.   When I did have 2 services with you,  you could not link the accounts.   For such a big company you Guys are so horrible with the tools your reps have to solve your clients issues.",0
Very bad service in the world. Like to do less than one star. Billing department is very sucks ...Lots of hidden charges.,0
I have had ATT mobile service for 2 years. I signed up through SAM'S Club. The account was set up using the wrong phone number. I have contacted ATT several times to correct it and was assured that it was correct. I have been working with ATT for 3 days now to correct this. This is desperately needed due to I can not make any updates to my account because they need to verify it's me by sending the code to this incorrect phone number. Well that protects ATT but doesn't help me. Today after going through this vicious circle again I had the smart idea to contact the Escalation department to be told that according to a supervisor these accounts setup via Sam's Club are no longer supported. I will be canceling all accounts as they come up for contract renewal.  I have had some type of account with ATT since 1977. They have now fallen to a state for which I don't see them recovering. No support or care for their customers is as low as they can go.,0
Att services is terrible.. the quality is worst than last year..weak services..customer service is useless..really..because they can't do anything the computer won't do..useless!,0
"Have been with T-mobile for 10 months. Customer service was great, cell service wasn’t working out called ATT to see what they could do. I asked about a 12 month prepaid service they advertised. The woman asked why I wanted prepaid and then hung up on me. Called back and got someone new. Told them I was a veteran and asked about the discount. When she said it was 80 dollars per line, I said it was much more than advertised on line and that’s when it went downhill. She was borderline yelling at me. I asked her why she was so mad and she didn’t answer. Thanked her for her time and end the call. Looks like I dodged a bullet. If this was potentially new customer behavior, I’d hate to see if I had an issue.",0
"I recently switched to Att and I feel I was lied to. They say everything they want to hear to get you to switch and now I have to keep Att for 3 years or l'll need to pay off the phone we got supposedly for free. Reception is bad, they said no activation fees and I was charged $175, Be aware and ask questions and if you're happy with your current wireless company, please stay with them and AVOID Att at all cost. I also just learned that you have 14 day I think to cancel if you're not happy and I was never told that.I'm so upset and I can't wait for the 3 years to be over so l can cancel Att. Att sucks,",0
Atnt is the absolute worst! One manager told me one thing last week and today after holding on for 2 hours on the phone to speak with a managerthey changed their whole story I have had Atnt for over 12 years but no more! They gave me false information and changed my plan without informing me. I had no idea.#dontgetatnt,0
"For the third time and the second within a year, my service was cut off for no reason except ATT did not refresh the connection in some way. I was driving around with no service for the day to only discover this when I returned home. As I said this is the third time this has happened. Called customer service on a second phone and after having to provide phone info and spending a long time on the phone the problem was fixed. No apologies for my inconvenience, just another day at ATT. Second, with prepaid service you cannot contact customer service other than by phone and texting. If you have no service and have only one phone, how do you do this? I tried to use the online chat service, but I was told they couldn't help me because I'm prepaid. This happened last year. I purchased a second phone at the time. I've been on ATT for around 20 years. No more.",0
"I would go negative if possible. I was with ATT over 10 years. Went to the Levelland, Texas store and had the worst experience ever!!!!   DO NOT use this store. Drive to Lubbock if you need to go to a store.   I am leaving ATT over this experience.",0
The client service is ridiculous.I couldn’t even apply.I don’t recommend.I wasted more than 30 minutes of my life for nothing.Search for another provide.I will be happier.,0
AT&T you suck. You raise internet bill and your service sucks and is worthless. You should pay me to put up with your company. Pls go to hell. I hope your co goes out of business,0
"AT&T IS HORRIBLE! THE BILL IS NEVER DRAFTED ON TIME EVEN THOUGH I AM ON AUTOPAY!!!! Then when they draft it, they draft my account for 2 payments at the same time! My service is always sketchy! Neither one of my mobile phones work in my office! I have to walk outside to get a good signal. Then they have the nerve to charge late fees when they do not draft the payment on time! They always want their payment, but their service is horrible! I truly despise them! I am done with them as soon as my mobile contract is over!!",0
I am done with AT&T prepaid cell phone service.  The past month I was told they overbilled me $75. The adjusted bill only reflected around $30.  At another place I lived they charged my card but disconnected my service after a week with no explanation.  I requested a refund but never received anything back.,0
"AT&T is unreliable and terrible for businesses, whenever there is an internal problem, the text supporters are absolutely useless. When they try to fix my internet they made it even worse. As a business, we have lost so much money to AT&T’s internal problems, from not being able to take calls to our lines and WiFi cutting off entirely, and all they give us is a $17 credit per day? We have lost over $8,000 of business and have to resort to using our personal phones as our main lines to take in calls.",0
"I paid for international travel prior to arriving in a high threat level country.  I was charged right away and never received the service.  They have a text chat function, which I used many times, day after day.  NO response, Zero. I had people waiting for my calls to tell them I was okay, ofcourse, I was not able to do this. They clearly have no regard for their customers whatsoever. I finally reached an agent today and was put on hold, then she hung up the call.  Do not consider ATT.",0
Horrible internet service horrible customer service.,0
Deserve zero stars. Called and canceled my ATT internet the first of June. It was turned off 7/7 and charging me for service 7/2. They bill for upcoming months. They owe me a refund for crappie DSL service and will not refund my money. I live on a fixed income and had new service connected the first of June and had yo pay for tgat upfront too,0
"The worst company .thieves charging every month without service excuses liars never try to grab ATT Never it’s enough  charges for everything and ridiculous. Have service 16 days and they want me to pay 265 dlls plus 90 plus 110  since April and still more NO .they lied to me offered a free phone charging company and then apears in my bill 1250 x3  of course I returned but now they want 55 dlls x3 = 165 for return, they LIED to me",0
I will give 0 star but not able to. Two times Atnt has increased my bill without my knowledge adding additional charge which is 120$ more. When I called customer care they are not able to answer and check history as I called them few times previously. Worse service ever and no proper mobile app as well. I had 6 lines in my account.,0
They deserve no stars!!!! Absolutely horrible service! Can’t even keep with payments always charging for wrong stuff don’t keep up with anything! Here it is the phone bill is split and paid and the service still sucks they absolutely SUCK!!!!!! They also gave a new so called internet air that don’t even work!!!! And then have another internet thing on when it was canceled and kept charging for it!!!! RUN AWAY FROM THIS DUMB COMPANY THEY SUCK,0
AT&T is absolutely awful. They have been trying to bury my fiber line for 5 weeks now. Came out today and severed my neighbor's line. Now they are out of service. Jump in the truck and sped away. Called customer service and go the run around. I have no idea when my ticket will be resolved.,0
"I’m moving to another address and called to move my services. At that time, it was determined that ATT Internet is not offered at that address. So I had the cancel my services. The gentleman was SO NICE and SO HELPFUL! However, since that call, u have received 5 more calls and talked to 2 people who tried to get me to keep my services when I move. WHY are they calling me like they have no idea that they don’t offer internet at my new address? Supposedly the calls are recorded. I’m not buying it. Talked to someone yesterday afternoon and told them to stop calling. Then today someone else calls. 3 of the 5 calls have been within 24 hours. It’s infuriating that my holiday weekend is being interrupted for literally no reason. Maybe they will take me seriously this time when I say stop calling me. GET IT TOGETHER ATT!!!!",0
"I should’ve stayed with spectrum, the service is no different-It’s unreliable no matter where I go, at least Spectrum has great customer service. Verizon is the best with service but they love adding random/incorrect fees & withholding information about actual cost-you can never trust them. Well, at least AT&T is consistent about their poor performance.",0
AT&T used to be very goodI’m with them since 2015Now they just charge you things for no reason and not refunding you unjustified chargesI’m done with them !,0
"Worst customer service ever. I work at a small business and we just switched our internet service over onto these ducking people. Tried to call 4 different customer service lines which all made me wait a total of 3 hours to get in contact with someone about our services being out. Our security question and security access code was never setup and to get any access to our account you need one of these things. The customer service rep was super hard to understand and when he needed to call AT&T using the same number they picked up immediately super unfair and disorganized. Don’t use this service at all, they don’t help and it all seems like a scam. Still dealing with BS currently.",0
my at&t is not working at all.,0
"Being robbed for not speaking English, I already had an internet plan in my apartment with At&t, I paid $60 and my 2 phone lines were from Mint Mobile and I paid $90 per month.I was receiving AT&T advertising at my house. On June 25th I was going to celebrate my birthday and before that on Saturday I decided to go to the store and look at the promotions.After seeing it I decided to make a plan by transferring my lines and buying an Apple Watch and an iPad.They offered me a plan with 2 lines for R$60 each, totaling R$120. The Apple Watch would cost R$19.45 per month and they also offered me an iPad for R$11.12 per month. They would also give me a 20% discount on the lines because I have an internet plan in my apartment for which I pay R$60.I have the prices for everything detailed.On June 26th I received an email saying that I had taken out insurance, I entered the chat on the same day, receiving very good service, they told me that there was no problem and that the service would be canceled and the amount removed from the account (but not it was because they were charging me).That day in the chat I took advantage and also confirmed the prices I contracted, and it was told to me that I should only pay the amounts of $120 for the lines with 20% discount; $60 online; 19.45 apple watch; 11.12 iPad.On June 28th I received the first invoice (5 days after subscribing to the plan).The feeling is the same, I was robbed, like a store the size of AT&T deceives me like that and adds plans and more plans, fees and more fees, services and more services, charging me a whopping $543.00. I would have to be very stupid to go into a store paying a monthly fee of 145.00 and want to leave paying 543.00.I hope At&t resolves my issue as quickly as possible.",0
"One of the worst companies I've ever interacted with. They made a mistake and trying to fix it has cost me a ridiculous amount of time and money, and no one seems to be able to make things right, let alone do a gesture for all my time wasted. I RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY TO STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.",0
I was a long time customer back in august 2023 i cancel my dirct tv with them and now im getting a bill for 2 months and i've been calling them since april asking them whats going on and all they can say this charges are ligit how can they be ligit if i cancel my direct tv with them the people i talked to cant do nothing i told them how can it be ligit if i cancel august 2023 all i told them was close my account with me not owing you guys nothing and we will be done they have some rude as people working there and managers are something else i will never do anything with them ever again,0
"AT&T has to be one of the worst cell phone providers to be. I’ve currently been with AT&T well over four years and I’ve started having issues with service. Now I did change addresses, which I notified them and they’re claiming the reason for my issues is because I’m near a large body of water. But that can’t be true because I can go anywhere and still have the same issue where I’m not able to make phone calls, receive phone calls, send text, and receive text. Even the Internet would not work. I told AT&T this and they said well there’s nothing we can do. We already get a lot of complaints from your area already. And that came from a manager. So once I pay off anything I have with AT&T. I will be heading out as fast as I can and never looking back. I advise anyone who is thinking of going to AT&T to definitely , DO NOT USE AT&T.",0
"I have never in my life experience such shotty service.  Our phone service is constantly going down, speed is representative of dial up, phone goes into SOS mode constantly.  Tried calling tech support and they just try to sell you more services.  I can't wait to switch!",0
"HORRIBLE COMPANY!!  We turned off the cellular data on our phones on a recent overseas trip and they still charged us for calls we didn't make.  Although we had been customers for over 20 years, they would not refund the charges. This is just one of many bad experiences we have had with AT&T. The customer service is HORRIBLE!!",0
"AT&T emailed me someone else’s billing information, full ID, and Full account number. When I called and told them they said there is nothing they can do, the other person has to fix it. So AT&T can send you someone else’s personal information and then have no way to fix it. They’re lucky I’m not using this information against the other person. Highly unsafe.",0
"AT&T is complete trash. My internet (fiber) has been down for three weeks now. So what do they do? Slow my hot spot. AT&T is loosing me millions on deals that I do from home on my WiFi and I called them and I got a simple apology. If you loose a f$&3 million dollars a f***** day. Sir. Pardon my ignorance. But your apology means nothing. Reimburse me ATT, you c$$$",0
Been on hold for almost 2.5 hours to get help with network issues that have been happening for a month now.  I have been a customer for well over a decade and this is going to be the last straw,0
"Stay away from AT & T Wireless.!!!   Basically they do not really know their cell phone coverage areas. All they want to do is sell you a phone(s). They set up an account with autopay so they can bill a month in advance, the minute your walk out of the store. Then if your phones don't connect from your home area,  they GOT YOU FOR restocking fees and a months service.   Then just try and contact someone at AT & T.  Their Service is almost non-extant .!!   The representatives make up stuff on the phone and no two will tell you the same information.    Terrible , Terrible company do deal with.",0
Now att makes it so if you buy a phone you can only use it on the line your buying it for.Another way to force you to spend more money.They  use foreign customer serviceIm leaving this company after 24 years of bull,0
"This is the worst company i been with and encourage anyone not to do business with these guys , they charge you hidden fees and customer services is horrible they keep charging you for all kinds of fees.",0
"When I first got service with AT&T 2 years ago I had no issues. Recently they said they were going up on prices (a rep told me because of inflation) and since then my wireless and internet are useless. I don’t get phone service in the same areas, several dead spots, and the WiFi is basically to watch tv, nothing else. And they’ve told me I have the fastest package they offer in my area. Don’t recommend.",0
"I wish trust pilot could give me the option to leave 0 starts, WORST COMPANY EVER. They scam you, steal from you and increase prices without telling you. To after they charge you, they can tell you that they can decrease the price after they charge you more than they should. I rather die than return to ATT. I switched to another mobile company, they told me that after the numbers are transferred, the AtT service lines would be automatically cancelled. We are a family of 4. Everyone except my sister choose to not change their number, just transfer the number. We ask several times if the limes would be canceled, they did it with the 3 phones that choose to stay with the same number, but not with my sister number. My sister number was active and they were charging 77.04 for it, a line that was not being used. I HAVE TO ALSO SHARE THE HORRIBLE WAIT TIME IN THE CALLS. In companies like Spectrum the wait time is less than 3 minutes, in Att is 1 hour or more. Worst mobile service ever. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. You paid your phones, they increase the prices of the lines, and also they charge 100 dollars when you request technical support on the home internet while in T mobile, Spectrum this is free, that’s why I said that they scam you or steal from you, because that is supposed to be a free included service. No way. Dunno how they can still in the mobile business. But karma exist and justice does also exist. Why they have to be like this ? Why can’t they be a good mobile company, why choose to be evil. Me, family and even friends will never be back to this dark hole called ATT",0
Absolutely terrible company that makes it so difficult to do anything online. For such a large company it is unbelievable to see how behind they are technologically. I am exceptionally good with technology and I am most likely still going to have to deal with customer service for a simple prepaid plan setup with esim.,0
No matter what they offer do not allow ATT autopay to access your bank. ATT withdrew $430 from our account for a duplicate phone they sent to us in error. We returned the phone through a certified ATT representative yet they still withdrew the money. After numerous contacts with numerous ATT representatives the money was returned but they immediately re-created the $430 charge. We shut down autopay prior to any further fraudulent withdrawals but now are harassed every month with threats to our credit rating if we don’t pay this money we in fact do not owe. Six months of contact with numerous ATT representatives and the harassment continues though at the end of each contact ATT admits that the error is on their end and it will be fixed through their fraud department. Only days later to receive contact from the fraud department telling us it is not an issue for them and we should contact customer service. That cycle has occurred through eight calls…many last over an hour. In our experience it is the ATT Fraud Department that is a fraud. Beware! Beware! Beware! ATT Wireless says all the right things to draw you in but provides absolutely no support once you have accepted their “service.” And we use the word service with quotes because there is not any helpful service from their end.,0
"There is a very low level of staff training. One gets the impression that they are coming up with explanations on the fly, although they themselves do not understand anything. The system's automatic responses at the embryo level speak only to say something not to the point. Very disappointed.",0
Att has the worst customer service!!!! They will continue to transfer you to another rep then the call will drop. This has been a consistent issue. My call today I was given a different number to call upon calling that number the rep tried to give me the original number I had 1st called sooo she gave me another number. That number gave me a number to sign up for a Medicare supplement! Now I’ve been holding 2 hours the rep explained she would have the correct department call me back. The rep that returned my call was again the incorrect department. I’ve been trying to handle this issue for 4 HOURS. And there sells reps are nothing but liars!!!!! This is why I cancelled  ATT after 25 years.I was a foul to give att another chance. ZERO stars,0
"The worst experience EVER!I wish I can give zero star here.Here is a story: decided to try a service for Apple watch I bough for my kid, but the service for watch does not work without a phone, so I decided I do not need that service (i did not activate that service, I did not use it a single second), tried to cancel it and was NOT able to do so!!! Went to customer support online, over the phone, two different stores and answer was the always the same - ""Im sorry we are not able to cancel this service without passcode"" (and thats after I provided all possible IDs - passport, SSN, driver license). So I decided to just remove my payment method from that NEWER USED service and guess what - ATT contacted me for no payments and threaten they will go to collectors.P.S Recommendations to ATT managers (PMs, TPMs, etc): learn the ""breaking glass scenario"" and implement it!P.P.SThe ""breaking glass scenario"" refers to a contingency plan that is put in place for emergency situations (ex: no passcode and client wants to cancel the service - they should able to do so!!!!)",0
"Want to waste 3 hours of a perfectly good day? Call AT&T customer support for something easy and straight-forward. Then get told you have the wrong department. Expect to get hung up on during the ""transfer"". Try new number, speak to new agent & get told the same thing and then hung up on again. Rinse repeat for 3 hours and never have your issue settled.  Their strategy is to play department ping-pong until you have completely lost hope of ever fixing your simple issue. Cherry on top; Their Fraud Department is completely brain dead with zero decision making power. Literally worst customer service, ever- I would give AT&T a negative 5 star rating if I could.",0
"If I could give less I would.Got told I could trade in my device to get a credit that would fully cover a new device in order to secure my business. Did so and later found out they're doing that over a 36 month period, something not mentioned at any stage during the sales process.I'm abroad and want to access the second eSIM slot in my phone to get a local plan in the country I'm in. AT&T have my phone locked and won't unlock it due to the balance on the phone from spreading my trade-in credit out over 36 months.Nothing they'll do to allow me access to this second slot. Got told there's a slight extra balance than what my trade in credit gives (annoying but no big deal) problem is if I try pay that early to remove the lock the remaining balance of trade in credits aren't counted and there's nothing they'll do about that.So now I'm stuck in a different country for a month with no phone service from their network and I can't get a local network on my device cause they're blocking it. Shady business practice. Don't do business with AT&T.",0
I have been a att customer since Bellsouth mobility for no reason they increase my cell bill 25.00 . They truly don't believe in customer in keeping your business.I true wouldn't recommend AT@T wireless and this coming from a person who has Been with thee since Bellsouth Mobility but no more.,0
Horrendous. The customer service is inept and rude.,0
"If I could give negative 100 stars, I WOULD! I was with AT&T prepaid service and when I went to port my number (which I ported to them from cricket!) They locked my line! They put what they called ""fraud protection"" on it and refused to release it!!! So now I had to get an entire new number because they refused to release my number! I can not believe this crap! I've had that number for 10 years and now I had to change it! I am so mad! I also want a refund since you renewed my plan today!",0
"Went to the store to get a new phone. a very kind employee was waiting on hold for 4 hrs. During the 4hrs i watched the sun melt slowly down the walls of the store with my mother. After the 4hrs and minimal progress was made, we finally got to actually purchasing the phone. We randomly got selected for a fraud department shake down. But unfortunately the fraud department was closed. I rise from my beautiful slumber to start on my pilgrimage to the at&t store. I was  greeted by my favorite associate and a new one who was just as kind. I sit and i wait. The anticipation was overwhelming, finally my iphone 8 that ive had since it came out can lay to rest. But again was met by the corporate thugs that do things with no rhyme or reason. Only to enforce the power dynamic over the little guy that is so immovable in our society. My disappointment is immeasurable. One star.",0
"They don't even deserve 1 star.  Their mobile sales team that sets up kiosks in places like bjs, Costco, target... They lie to your face about costs.  If they offer you a free phone, run like the wind.  Smiling faces tell lies.",0

Went there to get help linking my phone to a wifi tablet the lady there said I couldn't do it tried selling me internet service but then said for whatever reason I wasn't approved for it started talking about their tablets at 600.00 dollars I said I guess I'll send the tablet back and forget the whole thing I'm not really knowledgeable about any of this but went home and spent a good part of the day linking to Bluetooth got it all working and all is good she doesn't either know or care about what she's doing just cares about upselling will never go to this store at trinity point washington pa again they suck and the cabela drive store is even worse I'll have to find another store or a new service provider,0
"Absolutely horrendou policies they truly suck! Refused to change my pay date 1 day! 1 day short of my payday direct pay!! The hell they put me through going 1 day without service paying out of pocket costs, lost work running around to add money, health issues and torment! I felt utterly abused and enslaved! They forced me to keep my service because I'm poor elderly and disabled working part time to cover inadequate social security income. I paid cash for my pp phone to be told today that they cannot approve device unlock on my for 6 months after purchase to switch to another carrier service Sim card! Brutal Barbaric policies to force profits!!! I'm calling around for a lawyer! I recorded every call evey email text and my contract.  Even recorded secretly the sales agent who sold me this more expensive phone because he said they out of stock on the cheaper phone I went there for to begin with! I feel tricked and humiliated!!

"Absolutely the worst cell provider company i have ever utilized. This is across the US, Australia and the UK.

"Forever disappointed! Stay away from this company! Bunch of unprofessional liars !We’ve had sooo many issues with this company.First we opened an account with 7 devices attached to it. (A whole different story down there too)After we moved we’ve placed a Fiber home internet and everyone promised we will have $35 per month cause we have this another account with the company.But no. We’ve been receiving 4 months continuously $60 and every time I’ve called and asked why, they have been lying to me and saying that it is just first 3 months cycle and then, we will be paying less minus deduction for the overpaid first months.Now, I’m calling for our 5th month, and they are saying “oh no sorry that my other colleagues gave you false promises, your account is not eligible for this $35 per month because your other account is a business account and not a personal one.”))I’m tired . Tired of US ripping off their residents, lying for $ .And I’m not rasist but when you hire half of India or Pakistan , you at least have to educate them and explain how the business works before putting them on the phone like monkeys with fake names .",0
"I would say 0 stars, but not an option. They have told me numerous times my account is all set, I even have a credit when I check it online, and when a rep (when I can actually talk to someone) checks it, they agree - I owe no money. Yet I keep getting emails and texts referencing an unpaid balance and a credit card that is no longer on my account, and now they have suspended service until I pay a balance I don't have. I was bounced around through 9 different people, each more useless than the last. Customer service is an oxymoron, and this company is the absoluet worst. I would rather deal with carrier pigeons and the USPS.",0
They rip you off if you try and switch.They quoted 100 dollars for the phone and charged over 200. I will stear everyone clear of att,0
I call customer service regarding why the Internet not working. Made me do all the steps to restart. While she is checking I advise since I had the Internet phone we have been unable to make outbound phone calls. This representative advise me it's because of the outage. OMG I knew I had someone on the phone that didn't know what she was talking about. I have had the service for awhile. I had to hung up. I call back and when I was told internet outage started at 6pm and will be by 8am. Well no fix and now it's 2pm to 3pm. I ask actually where was the outage because I wanted to see there were anyone out fixing the issue...no real answer. Now I personally believe there was no one out late last night fixing anything. I'm sure there are going to charge a full month of service to the bill...at&t SMDH,0
"I am giving 1 star because there is no zeros… This is is the worse company. Always issues with them. My husband tried to switch his phone to another carrier due to bad signal in the area. Att asked him to pay off the balance on his phone in order to switch his line. They put it too difficult…my husband had to stay with Att however… they cancelled his line anyway, and reconnected his line. Plus, they upgraded his line to a Premium plan so he will have a better reception….. LIE!!! Nothing improved! So, I checked my bill today.. SURPRISE!! My bill is $615.98…. Really??? So I called Att to see what happened, the representative explained to me the whole mess. Why they shut down the line if the phone was not paid off? Long story….. now I have a case open, that may be resolved by July 2nd….. so, what is going to happen with the bill???  Because I am not paying it! Att is a joke…….",0
"It is almost impossible to speak to a human. I spent over 3 hours on the phone, some with multiple agents when I was finally able to access them. I pay by the minute of use. I made several calls to various AT&T tollfree numbers (most deadends without being able to talk to an agent). I finally reached a human by calling their sales department. I have multiple issues with my account and STILL need them resolved. The biggest issues is that after having called these multiple AT&T numbers they charged me for every one of them and will NOT credit me for the calls. They adamantly say that they do NOT charge for calls to A&T but they DO. I ran out of charge time on my phone so have to wait until Monday to continue. I cannot log into my account. They said they would send me a text with a password but ALL I got was a message saying my PW had been changed (no PW provided).AT&T gives rotten customer service and they do their best NOT to connect you to a human.

We have been with att for 28 yrs. My recent disappointment in service has lead us to leave your company. Please feel free to review our account for all the details and concerns we have had it's a book long.The biggest concern is no communication skills.I bought my self a new ph last July for my birthday it came the wrong ph the wrong color . Att says no worries the store will exchange it .... no that did not happen. My pain continues with finding out today I still owe over 500.00 for this ph that was a 800.00 exchange well I had surgery and did not respond to a text message that kicked me out of the promotion. I will share this on every forum available 28 yrs of loyalty means nothing . I remember when your reps would say ...How Can I Make YouA Very Satisfied Customer. Long ago. But my advice to att is you need to hire (Well Slow SpokenKind Respectful people),0
"Stay away from AT&T Office @ Hand and Ring Central for telephone service. They have outsourced all support to a call center in the Philipines called Global Support. I spent 3 hours today chasing my tail to try to get support. In the end, I gave up. I am now looking for a replacement provider. Their support people don't speak english well, don't understanmd english that well. Couple the language barrier with crappy VOIP service that lets you hear every other word and you start to understand the impossibility of fixing tech issues.",0
"For a month and a half I have been dealing with AT&T and I'm getting nowhere. I have 3 lines on my account. My son's phone screen just went black. We were told it was a warranty issue. We sent the phone back with a UPS label that was provided by AT&T, somehow UPS lost the phone because the only scan that UPS shows for that tracking number shows it was scanned into the UPS system and that's where it stops. AT&T has been rude and unhelpful. We were told by AT&T to file a claim with UPS, we did, then we get an email from UPS saying that we are the 3rd party and AT&T has to file the claim. We call AT&T and they are telling me that they can't submit a claim, it's our responsibility. UPS says it's up to AT&T and the whole time AT&T keeps saying that they won't restore our service until they get the phone or we pay $1000.00. This is ridiculous. I swear I'm ready to start calling attorney's to round up other people to start a class action lawsuit. First we had to deal with their damn data breach, now this. Can anyone help?",0
"I have been an AT&T customer for countless years. However, their customer service has declined to the worst level possible. Today I spent over two hours on the phone and was transferred 4 times. I was on hold over 1 1/2 and each time I was transferred, my hold time started over again. All I needed was to review my bill and options for decreasing my monthly bill. Once I did speak to a representative, they were poorly trained. The same person gave me different answers and finally I was so defeated, I just stopped asking questions. It was possibly the worst customer service I ever experienced! A very disappointed, long time customer!",0
"ATT has the worst customer service in their stores I have ever experienced. The employees lie about the promotion amount to turn in old phone and also sign you up for new phone insurance as well as other services without your permission or knowledge....? He told me my bill would only be $10 more a month.Not only that, but they continue to deduct money from your account after you change Companies. And after you change companies, you can no longer call or contact them since your phone number is no longer associated with them (Recording will hang up on you), and even when you could call and inquire about billing errors, which there were many, they never did what they said they would regarding refunds!They should be investigated by the Better Business Bureau and or government Agencies!",0
Worst company,0
"Don get AT&T!!!I was a Direct TV subscriber.  They constantly try ways to keep raising your rates. On auto pay you dont always notice until its too late.I cancelled my service on a phone call.  Agent told me they would get back to me on whether or not to return equipment.My bad for not checking but after a few months i noticed they where charging my card for several months 134$/ month. I called customer support who told me they could find no record of me cancelling.  I had no way of knowing because I disconnected equipment immediately after stopping service.when I told them that this was creditcard fraud after much discussion and several ""agents"" they reversed charges and money came back to my credit card.Now they are writing me letters threatening collections if I dont pay them back the money again.508$.",0
I paid off a phone through their debt collector and jumping through hoops of customer service in order to just unlock the phone at&t has a terrible customer service. I will never use this service again and don't recommend anyone to.,0
"I would happily rate AT & T a 0.5 months ago I had ordered an online sim card. But then it didn’t arrive on time so I went on to the store and purchase another sim card. Since  I no longer needed the online ordered SIM card, I had canceled it. But now, I see that I am being charged for the sim I never used, in fact canceled for the past 5 months.Now when I called their customer service (which is the worst), some had no idea what they are talking about. Some agents just disconnected the line and never called back after almost half an hour of waiting. And now they’re saying that I might have to pay for the line that I didn’t use at all, and the mistake of their agent who did not canceled it when I called them.Why I have to pay for their mistake and something I never used.And this is absolutely not a first time that i have suffered because of the worst customer service by At & T.Ridiculous!",0
I gave one because I can't put none but I buy my Samsung Flip 5 inside of a promotion and in the promotion doesn't said that need to buy it online and both customer service and neither a manager could help me with this offers and I buy it inside of the offer,0
Tried calling 3 times to inquire about home internet. Each time placed on ridiculous long holds. Will be canceling my mobile service as well. Terrible customer service,0
"AT&T does not deserve good customers (10+ years) if they shut off the phone without notice, and lock the phone to a robot.  For the Internet, I found Xfility for $9.95 a month.  They did not stop service or send threatening shutoff messages when ACP was not renewed.  I do not care to deal with AT&T again.  Thank you for your consistent concern, I appreciate it. I think I deserve back the $58.60 that I paid for the Interim phone, and some reimbursement for the frantic week I spent with NO phone, trying to find out why you shut it off.  That was nasty, being locked to a robot who demanded my credit card, and even nastier when I reached that woman.   I would appreciate a check for $58.60 for the month-to month interim phone (Lyca) plus a check of reimbursement for the Metro Mobile (att) which cost $62.73 for the Metro Mobile - plus the loss of a week, being terrified, and running around with a caregiver, desperately trying to get a phone set up.and for all the upset trying to get phone when there was no phone.  I REMIND YOU THAT I AM ELDERLY, DISABLED (STROKE) and it is highly dangerous for me not to have a phone to call for help, should I fall, or become frightened.  Due to your despicable handling of the Congress not renewing your government subsidy, you placed my life in danger, and caused me the loss of a frantic week, and $119.11 for phone service, and one week of caregiver time - 25 hours at 17.35 an hour through IHSS.   That is $433.75 that you owe us back, $552.86, plus damages for being so frightened.",0
"I just don’t have service ever. I was in fl and moved to co and everywhere is a black zone, terrible customer service as well",0
I would like to give a Zero because zero service zero customer service zero 💯 lies about the price and benefits and the representative is a big scam lies about everything and customer service is unavailable to help I can’t wait to rid of the fraud but sadly i have to wait until 2027  I’m not gonna recommended AT&T to my friends and family. I’m gonna tell them stay away from them because they are scam big liar and fraud.,0
"When I leave AT&T, I will never be going back. I ordered a mobile device on May 15, 2024, three times as an upgrade, and all orders have been canceled for no reason. Supervisor can’t figure it out, no one. I am on my 4th order and have very little doubt that it will ship. Today is June 14, 2024, still no device. The device is in stock in all colors, smh. Do not use AT&T as your phone carrier!",0
"Driver blocked my garbage cans, while working on neighbors poles. Why not block the people you’re working for??? Asked driver to move, he refused!!!",0
Since the breach my account was hacked. Payments we made went idk… someone filled a fraud thing and it was fraud against me yet you can’t get ahold of the fraud dept. my bill doubled ( I did not owe) turned off my services we just paid for and 2 months latter I can’t fix it.THEY R STILL BILLING NE FOR SERVICES I HAVE NOT HAD IN MONTHS!!!!I’m thinking of contacting a lawyer going to small claims.Customer service isn’t helpful either. They have my bank account 3214 that’s not my account. That account bounced payments and had money reversed to only god knows!!I’ve never bounced a check so SHAME ON YOU ATT!!!!I’d sugjest u fix this!!!Cynthia newton 916)904-4311I have called a dozen times. Went to stores in person.Verified the money I paid went to you and wasn’t reversed. This is FRAUD AGSINST ME!!!!Also u don’t keep billing for services u took away that’s incompetent.,0
"Horrible Experience with AT&T Cell Phone Service - Beware!I am writing this review to share my extremely negative experience with AT&T cell phone service in hopes of warning others before they make the same mistake I did. If this review saves at least one person, then it has done its job.From the very beginning, expectations regarding billing were not communicated clearly. This left me with a false sense of what I would be billed. Imagine my shock when the bill, which was supposed to be consistent, changed so much that it ended up being approximately $50 more per month than what I was initially told.The nightmare doesn't end there. Trying to reach the third-party seller that sold us the service at Target was extremely difficult. Their lack of availability and support added to my frustration. Even the local AT&T store admitted that the third-party seller did us dirty, confirming our fears that we were misled from the start.When I turned to AT&T customer service for help, they were anything but helpful. All they did was reduce our plan to something equivalent to the prepaid plan we had moved from, which was Boost Mobile. For the record, Boost Mobile had way better cost and service.This is a warning to anyone considering AT&T: Be sure you get any and all promises clearly stated, both verbally and in writing. Do not sign anything you haven't thoroughly read and understood. Ask them to explain it 20 times if you need to, but definitely get what your final bill will be IN WRITING.Our experience with AT&T has been horrible, and I will never use their services again. To make matters worse, we are now stuck with them for three years unless we pay a ridiculous amount to get out of the contract. Even our expectations regarding canceling services were incorrect; we were completely misinformed about what we could do if we wanted to cancel.Now we are stuck, feeling deceived and frustrated. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering AT&T. If it can prevent just one person from going through what we did, it will have served its purpose. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of AT&T.",0
I would have gave you zero stars if it let service worst service,0
"Since last year they have been charging me for service and equipment I don’t have. I’ve spoke with so many people it’s rediculous.  My bill is supposed to be $60 they changed it to $80, charged me for 3 boxes, because they kept messing up. I called the claim they fixed it. Next thing I know the charged &400 and cancelled my service. And saying I have tv internet and phone when I only have internet",0
"Horrible customer service. 25 minutes waiting to talk to a rep. Now waiting 48 hours for AT&T to unlock my phone, even though it is paid off. Plus their rates are much higher than the competition.",0
"They keep raising the prices. It went from 78 plus to 85 plus change to 95 for no reason. They signed me out of automatic pay and then charged me more because of it. I spent an hour and a half on the phone with a guy fixing it only for them to do the same thing a month later. When I signed up it was supposed to be 73 plus change but they added a fee of $5 for a free upgrade for something I WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR because you had to have the service for 6 months to be eligible. My two years is up in July and I am leaving this service and never returning. They steal money from you every way they can and unless you have and hour and a half every month to fix it only to have the same thing happen again a month later, it's not worth the aggravation. I am dumping a phone and living without it. I did that for ten years and now because of AT&T I am done with a phone.",0
"Totally ripped off by AT&T.  I was told by a representative when I transferred my internet service on approx. 4/29 that I would receive 2 months free service, due to the move.  He also reiterated during the conversation that I would make no payments for 2 months.  Not only did I not receive this, my service was disconnected shortly after I moved and I was charged $150.00 for not returning the equipment from the previous address.  I told them I was waiting for a return label and they stated to just go to a FED EX location and drop it off.  Had I know that, I would have already dropped the package off.  I called AT&T and was told that there were no notes reflecting the 2 free months.   I asked the rep where I would even get information like that?  I did not make up this conversation!   Not that AT&T cares, I will be looking for a different internet carrier.  I am super disappointed by AT&T!!!",0
AT&T is the worst phone service ever they don’t give a damn about there customers,0
"For the past four months our landline has not been working; either no tone, or no incoming call or a lot of static.  Every time we call, they say we are working on it.  There are too many trees in the area!  That is B.S.  They have not credited me for all the money that I have paid them and they try to convince me to get their mobile service.  Dream on.",0
I would give them 0 stars if I couldI have had alot of problems with this poor serviceI call and call and get told that the service will be fixed and it is not fixed and there's times I can't even get through to them to report my phone not workingWas told it was my phone and may need to upgrade to another oneI took my phone to be checked and it is not my phoneIt is there service !!!I am over this company and will never do business with them again!!!,0
"I would give it a zero star if possible. I have been a long time user of AT&T's wireless & internet service for years and paid all bills on time, and they made me go through hell just trying to cancel my service. They do not enable online cancels so I have to call customer support, and they do not list support numbers explicitly. Finally one of the numbers called me back, wouldn't honor my original date of cancel, and forced extra charges on me. I will never use their service ever again.",0
This company is a total rip off to customers.I can't wait to finish my contract and find another company. The service is terrible.,0
Bill went from $83 to $174,0
"I’ve come to this company, which was truly the worst decision I’ve ever made. I will find a way to get out of this horrible contract because I have been lied to for the last 4 months and no one seems to care. There is always a reason they can’t do anything to help me and I’m truly upset. I was told by a representative that when I can to AT&T from T-Mobile that they would buy me out of my contract with T-Mobile and now I have a balance in collections for $255 dollars that I just found out about today. Not to mention, I was told that my bill would be $89 a month and the lowest bill I’ve seen has be $125…. And every rep that I have spoken with has been unable to assist me.  This is ridiculous across the board and I truly truly truly DESPISE AT&T.  This isn’t fair at all and I want out of this contract.",0
Worse network service and kind a scam plot to switch from other carrier. Gave me discounts and almost the same rate of my previous carrier. After switching they starts increase the amount of bills. After 25 months almost doubled my bill amount.,0
"I recently called to lower my AT&T bill, as the bill was over $500.00 and there was a mistake. I had explained the situation of what had happened as I had sent a phone back and it was not taken off the bill. I was told "" I could lower my phone bill from two $230.00 to $ 209.00 and change plus tax"" with an additional line and a ""free"" phone. I should have known better as my bill is now over $300. I called to discuss the bill and  was disconnected by 2 customer service representatives. When I spoke with the first customer service representative on lowering my bill. Initially, on May 13th. I was on the phone for atleast an hour, never had one disconnection. I was being very polite although frustrated. When I spoke with the second customer was representative, he asked for a good contact number in case we got disconnected. I gave him my phone number and went over all the figures, the bill was higher than the first representatives figure! When I asked him how he arrived at that figure? We mysteriously got disconnected. Which his figure was more than the first representatives figure of $299.19. his figure was still over three hundred dollars and, that was with canceling some features I had on my phone. That is more than my car payment!!! It's ridiculous and obviously the AT&T  representatives lie to you. I am going to go down to the store tomorrow and cancel my service. Not to mention that I've been losing service at times for hours and It has been all over the news of the outages. I am done with you AT&T!",0
"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the service I have received from AT&T. The experience has been extremely frustrating and has caused me significant inconvenience.The issues began when I traded in my device and it was subsequently lost by AT&T. Despite my efforts to locate the device, I have been provided with conflicting information and have been unable to resolve the matter.Furthermore, I was misled by a sales representative who provided inaccurate information regarding the cost of my service plan. This has resulted in unexpected charges and has added to my frustration.I have made multiple visits to the store and have spoken with the manager, but the situation remains unresolved. I have also been on hold for extended periods of time when calling customer service, only to be disconnected without speaking to a representative.I am deeply disappointed with the level of service I have received and would like to request immediate assistance in resolving these issues. I would appreciate a prompt response and a fair resolution to this matter.Thank you for your attention to this matter.",0
"AT&T is absolutely the worst company to deal with when it comes to cell phones or even their TV service. We have been working on this from March until June trying to get her number changed to a new company and they gave us the runaround two hours 2 1/2 hours on the phone, every time you call, we called like 9 or 13 times still nerve result just trying to get a release pin number. It seems like nobody there knows what they’re doing or has permission to do anything. I would not recommend this company to anyone unless you want to be run around and lied to. They are absolutely the worst stay far away from them . We have been working this since March until June 10 and still have not gotten anywhere and this is trying to get an 84 year old lady just to get her phone straight unbelievable",0
"Went to the high ridge missouri at&t store at the end of March to ""upgrade "" or so we were told. We did not upgrade at all this is the worst phone and service we ever received from at&t. The little girl working was rude as could be anyway and talked us into a complete lie. Shame on you. Then the manager says oh sorry will try not to let that happen again in so many words. Absolutely disgusted with this",0
"Was solicited in a Target store to upgrade my phone.  Was told that Pixel would be equal trade, and that my plan would not change. I read the website before I submitted my phone for value evaluation, but somewhere in the paperwork fine print,very fine print...regardless of the value of your phone you will be locked into a new 36 month contract.  You can't get your phone back, owe no. You donate that to AT&T. But if I move to another carrier I owe AT&T $555.46. Scam(maybe, I definely feel like I've been scammed)?? Deceptive...DEFINITELY!",0
"Stay away from this Network.Awful customer service.I nearly lost my number while they trying to port and left me with no service for 2 days  and they confirmed i have good signal at my home address,but very bad signal.In 1 week  time i switched back to another network .I wasn’t even bothered the money i lost.If you need to speak to someone its take ages to connect.Awful Network.",0
"AT&T is the worst cellphone company I have ever been with. A sales person came to my house unsolicited, lied to my husband and I about our phone bill being lower if we switched over to them, said we would get $200 gift cards each for my husband and I, we caved in and traded in our phones and the sales rep lost or just simply didn’t ship my husbands phone so now they are saying they don’t know where it’s at and can’t give us the credits for it even though they lost it! My bill has not been low at all and I’m paying more than I was with my previous phone company and it’s been 7 months and my credits still have not been applied and no one in customer service will do anything about it, will be switching back over to my previous cellphone company ASAP!",0
"It took 9 days to get my WiFi running.  Not because of schedule date installation, but no one seems to know what the problem with my connection.  It took 5 agents, 9 days, hours and hours of wait time on the phone before someone finally figured out that I needed a fiber installed in my home.  Unknowledgeable customer support.  Hours and hours and days of wasted times. Frustration and anger is what I've experienced with AT&T just to get my wifi installed/transferred. I was ready to switch to Spectrum which I will soon if it wasn't for DirectTV steam which only offer to ATT&T.  But, my anger and frustration still exist with this company, I will soon switch and my friends and family will know exactly what my experience is and how I feel about AT&T.AT&T needs to train their support team in every aspect of figuring out what the issue is.  Should have the same support person to guide you through the process until it's resolved.  ATT should follow-up with customer to check on the results to see if it was resolved.  Not the customer calling back and be subjected to hours of wait again, be told get a call back just to go through the same process again with a new customer support.",0
Agents rule and hang up it was a man taking the call. Because I have been at AT&T since 2013 I have never had a phone cut off and tried to explain to them. when I had my surgery and was out of work 3month and tried to work the plan I had two situations going on. I don't appreciate it at all I keep your AT&T business going. From now on when I finish my device I will never get any more phones this time. I am move forwarding this AT&T company  !!! I get treated like terrible.,0
Had their land phone service and then I added dsl. I started with 10 mbps and after a few years it went down to 0.57. After 2 weeks the phone just went dead by itself. I was just paying and getting nothing. I called them and they said nothing wrong on their side. I switched to spectrum and have been happy ever since,0
"I had someone give me a quote for AT&T cellular, as I was having the AT&T fiber installed. Needless to say the wireless quote was way lower than what I was paying. So I made the switch and guess what, after it was all said and done I’m paying more. After many calls to customer service, which is a joke, I found out that I had the best deal possible. So now I’m paying less for a lesser service. If someone comes to your door selling their cellular, stay away and just realize it’s not what it appears.",0
I was lied to by AT&t twice when I got a phone and was told that I could return it and get a full refund. I signed up at the Walmart kiosk with a AT&t employee who lied to me and said that I want it be billed at all since I returned the phone I was unhappy within 4 days and canceled service and I still had to pay close to a $10 bill 30 days later. Another lie that the AT&t representative told was that he explained to me after I returned the phone I want to be able to sign up with AT&t again for 6 months which is okay I hope I never have to use them again but it was still another lie,0
"Att trade in service is a fraud. They estimated my iphone 13 was $700. But after sent in, and waiting for a 2 billing cycles, they credit me back $210. I am not agree with that and request for my trade in phone back but they stated that I have passed 14 days of return and as and online agent, they don’t have access to resolve. It is a scam. Please dont do trade in option because you will lose your phone value big time. I am a long time customer with att, and I promise to cancel because they are robber, they robbed my phone easily because I trusted them and sent my phone to them.",0
I used AT&T for 34 years. They could care less. They give better deals to a wretch off the street than long term loyal customers. I literally hate them and their woke culture and will never ever give them another cent. And the same for Directv.,0
"ATT makes promises that they don't keep. I established service six months ago an set up auto pay the same day. There is supposed to be a $5 discount for autopay. As of yet, six months later, there still is no discount! I have contacted ATT and they don't know why it hasn't been applied. There is nothing they can do about it! ATT lies and cheats it's customers.",0
"My dad’s truck broke down so he put his entire paycheck into it, he couldn’t pay his AT&T phone bill. His phone was cut off, so I called AT&T to make the payment myself. I was on the phone for an hour and 45 minutes, the entire time she was trying to sell me things. Finally, when I just had to tell her straight up, I’m not interested. I want to pay my dad‘s bill, she just hung up. Wasted an hour and 45 minutes today, my head hurts now. I’m getting my dad to switch to my phone plan, I am so thankful I didn’t purchase anything she was trying to sell. AT&T customer service is horrible.",0
"Be prepared to wait up to 3 hours to get someone on the phone, and then when they help you they will nicely SELL you an outdated phone or their Air internet service that looks like a toy and cannot be setup with customer support only available during business hours. Good luck with tech support. Don't get suckered into their selling tactics. I am on the phone now waiting again. The worst customer service.",0
"I wish I could give them zero stars. My bill changes every month. They do NOT honor payment arrangements unless you talk to a human (don't try to use their automated for this, it will not save!).For over 18 months I asked them how I could lower my bill and was told I was paying the lowest possible, then one day when I asked, the guy was like, ""Sure, I can lower it $10 for you!"" So for 18 months, I was paying $10 more than I should have.I've already been a part of ONE class-action suit against this terrible, corrupt (IMO) company, so I know they are crooked. I'm leaving them and going to Consumer Cellular.",0
I've been without my service for 2 weeks. I've been trying to get a tech out to fix the problem and no luck. I see they have gotten to big to give simple customer service now. I'm going to have to switch back to Spectrum which is just as bad!,0
"Don't bother, they will quote you a good price, tell you you are getting great promotions, tell you it takes months to show up on your account, then the promotions will never show up and you will finish out your contract paying 50-100 dollars more than they quoted. They will do nothing about it.",0
"Tech did not show up for appointment. I called. First time, the rep put me on hold…did not notify me I’d be on hold for 30 minutes. Second time I called, rep told me to put my desktop in a laundry basket and go next door for internet.Update- after speaking with another customer service rep.- the repair guy was running late. He finally showed up at 8pm (12-4pm was appointment time) and was able to fix the problem.",0
"My experience with AT&T has been extremely disappointing. My internet went down early Monday morning, and despite multiple calls to customer service, the earliest technician appointment I was given is on Friday. This prolonged outage has caused significant disruptions to my work. Additionally, communication from AT&T has been lacking, with no updates or proactive outreach to inform me of the status of the repair. I expected better service and support, especially considering the impact on my ability to work from home. AT&T needs to improve their response times and customer communication.",0
"Bought a NEW phone. Opened the package and tried to charge it, defective. They want to charge me $55 to replace it. The first phone was suppose to be brand new and not broken! Why should I be charged to replace a phone when I never received what I was promised, a new working phone. I have been with this company for many years, but this is the last straw.",0
