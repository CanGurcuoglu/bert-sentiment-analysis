"At my request, T-Mobile processed a suspension of my T-mobile home internet service and promised the monthly fee would be reduced from $50 to $10. As agreed, the service got suspended immediately but T-mobile continued to charge the full subscription amount of $50. When I called in again, the agent just said, sorry there was an update to our terms (= fineprint) and now when we suspend we continue to charge the full amount. Of course, this makes no sense whatsoever. Why even offer a suspension when you get charged no matter what. And not living up to the agreement is just fraudulent. Took me a lot of headaches and escalation to get the charge refunded and I just canceled my line. Goodbye T-Mobile. Never again! Current management seems to be on a mission to destroy all customer trust they once had.",0
Tried talking to customer service and am able to get anyone. Was talking to a Jay and he transferred me and no one ever came back on.  Very poor customer service I recommend do not sign up for the service as they do not stand behind anything once you sign up.  Impossible to speak with a human unless you go to a store hopefully you have 1 closer than 50 miles away.,0
"Representative MARTASHA from T-mobile lie to us so we could switch companies, she bribe us by telling us we will get new iPhones if we trade our phones, but that was a lie. We were considering switching to T-mobile, but every single representative we spoke to had lie to us and everyone said different information. We returned all the equipment they sent to us, and now they want to charge a restocking fee, even after having proof on writing what the representative offered was a lie just to get us to signed. They were so many hidden fees that doesn’t make sense, she said we will pay a certain amount a month, and ended up being wayyy more money that she told us. I should have listened to the reviews, this company has to be shut down!! What a nightmare they are.",0
Lies lies lies lies. Anything that comes out of their mouth is a lie and hidden fee you won't know about. Was due for an upgrade got a new phone and was told that it was paid off and time for upgrade so I did months later being hit with double charges for my monthly bill and come to find out they're charging me for both phones still that's crazy. Bill was 280 for no reason other then being misinformed,0
"Highly, highly highly recommend a HARD pass on Tmobile.  Their support is atrocious.  When it comes time to leave they make it brutal to reach them and do it and then they bill you for another couple of months and claim you didn't cancel.  Service is lousy. Go elsewhere - Dealt with Sam #4973207 and he truly had no ability to answer or resolve anything. Spent 2 hours the night before dealing with support person that was even less competent. There's a lot better and/or more affordable options.",0
"You can tell the people they hired are paid by the hour. The last several interactions I've had are outsourced so you can not even understand half of what is being said (and I'm in customer service and normally can) then simple what should be 5 minutes calls are put on hold for things the ""expert"" should know like 14 minutes to see how many gigs of data I used last month. Another 17 minutes on hold to tell me that I can upgrade my plan for one month for my vacation to get extra gigs. SERIOUSLY? 49 minutes for this convo- I'm traveling to mexico next week- wanted to make sure my plan covers international travel.  Her you only have 5gigs of data- me- can I buy more data?  That was the extent in entirety for 49 minutes! Not including the hour wait to talk to a tech. The people answering the phones there are just milking the clock. Or just not familiar in the slightest with where they work.",0
"They charged me for a year, 2 phone lines while I didn't have a single one! When I looked at the account, there's a random number I've never had! You'd think they'd apologize and refund me, but instead, they told me I should've checked my account! Pathetic! T-Mobile = Scammers",0
"They are a ridiculous and lying company! I made a cell phone plan and paid $127 every month for the plan, when the iPhone 16 was released they said that I could exchange the old device for the new one and I paid off the old device and got the new one and I would pay $127 dollars so I did I sent the device to them in the box that they sent me! I received 2 messages on the app saying that I had not yet sent the device and that my promotion would be canceled I called them and they informed me that it was already said that the device had already been received and that I did not need to worry 4 months would pass, I woke up my bill was $165 dollars. I went to the store to find out why, and the girl at the store told me it was because I hadn't sent the old device, so I had to cancel my contract. I had to pay $1,099 up front to keep my device, and I also lost my old device, which I had paid off because I sent it to them. People, don't sign a plan with T-Mobile, they don't honor the contract and in the end you'll lose. Look for another company. I looked and I'm satisfied with Verizon's service.",0
"Do not use these people! They of all cellular companies are the worst by far! The give you a billing date that means nothing to them if you have autopay. They claim autopay gives them the right to debit the payment 3-5 days before the due date . Why have a due date? Why not 3-5 days after the due date? They are desperate people . They will even charge you 10.00 to take the payment over the phone a day early! Their contract and word is worth nothing , just a company run by losers.",0
"This provider is a scam, cheat and a Lier.I have been with T-Mobile for several years with 3 lines, paying $105 a month which includes unlimited data.Last year they changed my plan without telling me and said it was a special offer, I ended up paying more and had to call them to revert to my original plan.I  have been in the UK for a while now, they blocked my unlimited data and roaming service, they said I was using too much data! I called them they were rude and would not restore my data and roaming service. I would give them a BIG 0 STAR if I could. I will be looking for another provider when I go back. What a big SCAM company.",0
"Representative at T'mobil made a bad mistake on 01/10/25 it was caught immediately. I called to speak to a manager,both were rude, and not helpful, I been a customer for 20 years thankfully no problems until now. The Rep was wrong, made an error, the managers admitted that but was still so rude and unprofessional.I am seeking another phone carrier.",0
"I would have to agree with the reviews that accuse T-mobile of being scammers. I found out My 83 year old MIL was being charged for T-Mobile $130/month for half a year for a phone she had cancelled. I tried multiple times to stop the withdrawals from her bank account but they refused to stop billing her because she “couldn’t remember her passcode.” The bank claimed they cannot cancel those monthly debits direct from account. They said we’d need to contact the debitor and disturbingly said that T-mobile wasn’t good about complying, I.e. they are scammers. T mobile eventually said she could cancel by going into the store. By the time I saw my MIL over holidays and took her to store to cancel, she was prob out $600 which they wouldn’t refund. What a bull$&@t company.",0
"Very very bad company! They sent me a device and when I returned it in same condition they charged me money for it saying that I damaged it! Despite the fact that it already arrived non working and damaged. And they use the fact that I cannot prove it because I took no pictures of it! Also they changed my plan without my knowledge and increased my monthly payment. Also one day I lost my internet driving in the middle of nowhere and lost my map. When I called them, they said that driver was disconnected?!!! What? So it was working before and someone disconnected it on purpose. When I asked for explanation, they couldn’t give one. But the last drop happened today. When I called the company and asked them to unlock my phone because I’m going to relatives funeral in Kiev, Ukraine, they said they would not do it because I’m on contract and it’s not up yet!! And on top of it they tried to sell me more international plans?!!! OMG. These people make money off of your pain!! STAY AWAY!",0
Negative 5 star review.   Was sold insurance and told at time of purchase of free phone replacement 4years later 20 amonth and a surprise 300 dollar for the free replacement phone.   Or I can upgrade from 300 for a worse model or 700.  Terrible scam,0
"TMobile is a scam company.  How do I know having never had an account with them?  They put a charge on my credit that I filed a fraud dispute over, but TMobile (And Transunion) refuse to examine the documents or give me the time of day.  I have 8 fraudulent bills in my file from TMobile, sent to MY house, meanwhile with the names of 7 other people on the bills.. My address.. another name.  I have sought to have Transunion consider these documents to no avail.  They are in cahoots one with the other.",0
Absolutely the worst customer service. I had a problem with my billing so I called the customer service and the woman said yes she can see there's a problem but you can't do anything with it right now. She tells me she will call me back today at 5:00 p.m. so I wait all day at home and she never calls. All they do is lie to you. They don't care if you have to pay more and all I did because I had the Netflix with ads and for $8.50 it said I could have it without the commercials so I go ahead and do it. Big mistake charges me almost $15 instead of the $8.50. So what do I do I just have to go to another phone company and get rid of T-Mobile because they don't care about that they outsource their customer service overseas where they just don't care there. They try to act nice but all you hear is noise in the background because they're all laughing having a good time. They promise you the world but when you have to make it change your account you have to go to an account specialist so you get passed on another 10-15 minutes and then they lie to you.,0
"Previously, I was prepaid only, as I didn't see the use of spending 60-90 for phone service. I needed internet, and options were limited in my area. They offered me $40 for my phone and $40 for internet. This was a lie. My bill is $120, not $80, with all of the additional fees. On top of this, I brought a perfectly unlocked phone to them, and they had the audacity to lock my phone and refuse to unlock it when I wanted to go elsewhere. Had I known they would do this, I would of never gone with them to begin with. I will be going right back to my prepaid service and use someone else for internet. These companies think they can do whatever they want to you. What right do you have to lock a phone that isn't your's? It was fully paid off. We as consumers need to stand up or continue to be controlled by these big corporations. We let them do anything to us..",0
"10,000 ZEROS! I have never, ever been more angry than I am right now. T-Mobile bills change without warning. They changed my services and added extras. I had to call them at least 10 times before I could find anyone that could or would even attempt to understand me.Hours spent talking to human robots that do not do anything to resolve problems by design. The lack of service is unecessarily abusive.They should greet you with: ""Welcome to T-Mobiles foreign-based customer torture chamber; how can we make your day more miserable? Do you enjoy repeating the same words over-and-over-and-over to barely English speaking people? Do you like being stuck in clown world vaccuum where nobody could hear you screaming? If so; T-Mobile is the place to be.That said; globalism reeks and so does T-Mobile.",0
"only put 1 star cause you have to!!  I went in to their store in Waterville to do a free up grade, granted it was time to pay my regular bill, so i expected to walk out 55$ less! We decide on the phone do all the work the whole time telling me nothing about fee's, last I knew FREE was FREE, suddenly he writes down $84 circles it and says this is what we'll pay today with tax n service, i said thats kind of high isnt it, oh wait is that including my $55 current owed, he jumped on it, and reassured me yes yes thats it! look at my bank account today and to my surprise 2 charges $55 and $84. Went back in to speak to someone they were no help jus basically told me it was fee's and taxes plus a walk in service charge, even though the phone rep told me I had to go do it at a store. So no resolve I'm no happy and will be shopping for a better place!! been dealing with them 2/3 years, no late, no complaint!!",0
"I ordered T-Mobile's home internet on October 17, 2024. Big mistake! No matter where I placed the gateway in our home, the gateway only showed one bar. What a joke! It wouldn't  provide a strong enough signal for even one of our smart TVs. Constant picture and sound lag. So I reinstated Spectrum internet. On Dec 26, I called and cancelled T-mobile. I was told the cancelation would not take effect until January 16, 2025. I argued that cancelation should take immediate effect, but to no avail. What a scam! This is their way of getting another full month of paid service despite the fact that I won't be using it from Dec 26th to when the cancelation takes effect on January 16th. This is no way for a company to earn consumer's trust and respect. Ipredict that T-Mobile's sketchy business practices will soon lead to its demise. A company just can't intentionally screw consumer's over and expect to remain in business.",0
T-Mobile Home Internet has been averaging 6-7 disconnects per day.  Calling or chatting with Support is always fun and interesting but they never have an answer other than resetting the equipment.Go with anyone else selling internet service except T-Mobile.,0
"I had Home Gateway that quit <9 mos old. Took it to T-Mobile store. It took 2 hours. They tried to give me new one as free exchange, however it would not work. So they pulled second one from back but told me it would ""cost me $11.04 because we already gave you one for free and we can't do it again"" I never had 1st new one in my hands or left store! Then they said, ""If you don't pay $11.04 then we can't give you Gateway. However, you can call T-mobile and order one for free that will come in 5 days."" I called Customer Svc in front of them and they told store ""you made a mistake and should not charge customer for second Gateway. There is a way to give it to him no-charge"" Store refused and charged me. Customer svc said they could not refund charge because of way store charged me. I called Manager who came to store. He said he would "" get refund to you in next 24 hours"". He never did. I disputed charge on my credit card. Therefore, T-Mobile added to my monthly bill, charged $15 late fee, and did not give me my autopay discount for the month. Therefore, my money bill is $40 higher this month than normal. T-Mobile is just as BAD, if not worse than Verizon, ATT, etc!!!",0
Hidden Fees for watch reactivations. And when you cancel they don't tell you they'll send you a final bill that doesn't come till a month later and they tack on more fees. I was forced to pay my bill late. Terrible service and hard to cancel.11558051198,0
"I have been a loyal customer with T-Mobile for over eight years always paid on time never had an issue with their billing. I tried to pay off a phone. The customer service representative told me the amount that I needed to close the account which never happened the phone remained locked, which I had already paid for And they charged me for two more months of service which they could see that I hadn’t used one minute of that service I called three separate times to be lied to to say it was taken care of and then I get a collection letter. I have a credit rating That is more important to me than paying them off.. And there’s no way I’m gonna let a hack job like T-Mobile screw it up so I paid them off again, but believe me I’m leaving bad reviews on every site that I see.It’s not worth your time your money and your sanity to join this cell phone company. Their service sucks and I’m talking about cell service too.",0
This is the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.  They sold me internet that never worked and never told me any time during a full month of tech calls and hours of my time that what they sold me would never work.  No internet for a month and gipted me out of a $200 rebate.  I warn anyone considering using T-Mobile internet to steer away.,0
"Tried to cancel internet before they sent me the modem. Told me I had to wait 24 hours but it would be cancelled and ""rest assured It would be cancelled and I wouldn't be charged"". Ended up on hold for 30mins the next day trying to make sure it's cancelled before I gave up. They sent it anyway. Now I need to figure out how to return this thing without being charged. It's ridiculous.",0
Just awful shop staff are incompetent changed my plan without telling me . Customer service the worst I have ever experienced took 9 days and close to 10hrs to restore my plan  plus charged me more than double the original plan cost !Phone service was great store  staff the worst and customer service the worst,0
"Review of T-Mobile Home Internet 15-Day Test DriveService Start: I began the 15-day trial with T-Mobile Home Internet in November. Initially, the service was poor, but after some adjustments, it significantly improved. I was impressed with the speed and quality of the service, to the point where I considered switching my lines from Xfinity to T-Mobile. However, due to the complexity of the process, I decided to cancel.Cancellation Process: I spoke with customer service, and they recommended canceling within the 15-day period, which I did. I received a return label for the equipment and sent it back before the deadline.Subsequent Issues: On November 29, I received a letter from the collections department for $55 with no explanation. I never received a bill from T-Mobile for this amount. Then, on December 9, 2024, I received another letter from a collection agency in PA for the same $55. Finally, on December 14, I received a bill for $32.66 for internet usage, despite having returned the equipment on time.Reflection: I am referring this case to the consumer protection department in the state of Oregon for review. It is concerning that a large company like T-Mobile uses tactics like these without following proper procedures. I hope that with advances in artificial intelligence, new companies with better services and more transparent practices will emerge, eliminating the need to deal with situations like this.",0
"We have had nothing but problems- dropping connectivity- had extra mesh installed, can't use or upload photos for work. The customer support is foreign and appears to read from a script/ is not a help. Multiple calls to customer support where they have an attitude. They ask the same questions over and over without logging the information or history. Cannot play video games etc- we lose internet continuously. After about a month , a different customer support said they would have continuous connectivity with our tower ( shouldn't it be already?) They say the same thing about the towers...And still the same issues again and again. Every time we call they ask the same questions wasting 20 or 30 minutes at a time like, our address, phone numbers etc...we have gotten hung up on or dropped from calls just to do it again. Once we have the opportunity we are changing our service to another company.After our call just today 3 January 2025 the lady finally admitted we were too far from our tower- so everyone else before knew that and kept taking our money. We only got one 1/2 of a month refund after complaining our faces off and now we finally know what the real issue is after 3 months! Apparently we are supposed to ""call back if we have continuous problems from here further"" Ridiculous and dishonest for them to obviously k own we wouldn't have connectivity where we are yet they allowed us to sign up. Total waste of time.",0
Got scammed. Internet did not work. Customer service is extremely lame. Store employees do not have authority,0
Thank you so much to all of you who took the time to share your negative experiences with us I appreciate it.  Because of the reviews and not one response from TMobile I have decided to go with another carrier.  So many reasons why I couldn't trust them ever I would say.  Happy Holidays.  Best.,0
"T mobile service is 💯 Horrible in my location ,, they promised last 4 years no worry we will have your service back working ,, unstable connection means never completely connecting to internet thus sucking data non stop.... they changed my contract from 100 gb to 50 but tells me it was always 50gb....what a big lie...",0
"I would give ""0"" if I could.  I am not complaining about the service across the country, although much improvement is necessary even on Interstates Freeways.  Instead, I am complaining about false advertisements for deals and rates.  As a senior citizen I chose to go with T-Mobile for its over 55 rates and I also chose to upgrade our phones because we were long overdue for new phones.  We went through Costco because not only were they giving $400 dollars per trade-in for each of our phones, but a Costco gift card on top of that (which they did). One year and seven months later, we are still paying for the phones, and it turns out to be FULL PRICE without the $400 trade-in. Their Customer Service is useless because I called about the bill within the first six months, and they said that our bills would reflect the $800 for the two trade-ins in due time.  Well, the bills continue at full rate. How dare they take advantage of seniors.",0
I have been LOYAL customer for close to 20 that is twenty years and lately they have chosen me my account to be slowest internet speed 4.12 down load speed and upload of 1.32 that is a disgrace for your service of $55 dollars a month,0
"I was with Tmobile for over 10 years, but it really went downhill. Poor customer service and price kept hiking every year. No quality service or benefits (upgrades, discounts, promotions) staying with them. I tried to keep my number, but they wouldn't let me when I switched carriers. All customer support people I talked too were from India or Philippines and they weren't that helpful.",0
I have been a customer of T-Mobile‘s for nine years. I went into the store today after being told I had a $3000 credit limit to upgrade my iPhone 12 to iPhone 16 Pro Max and was told essentially because although I make my payment on time every month I split the payments up into two payments. I’m being judged and now they want me to pay a total of $900 for two phones so I will be leaving T-Mobile.,0
"so here it is tmobile is over charging customers, here it is I have paid 1780 in fees and for services for the last 3 months to owe tmobile 1726 for services and fees to now being threaten to turn off my services for 200 dollars on a over payment they got in November and made adjustment on my billed to still charge it and get a message stating I have a past due for December 16 of 212 dollars to pay 300 on that 212.00 to owe them now 600 dollars! That’s a rip off! The supervisor said it well the 212 was past due but it was incorrect! How? How can a company say you owe them 212 in past due fees on the 16 of December to get a payment of 300 on the 23rd of December to now owe you 600 on the 25  and they turning my services off! Sad Tmobile, so the supervisor stated to now having to pay us more to get your phone back on to over charge again! this is not right!!",0
horrible company. piss poor coverage and rude personnel. when i paid them a year in advance they accused me of fraud. they are now dragging out mf refund. horrible company,0
Over the last year or so T mobile service in Denver has become near non existent. I can barely make calls and if I am able to make one they drop almost immediately. My texts don’t go through and I never have internet unless I’m connected to WiFi. It doesn’t matter where I am in Denver or Colorado. I’ve been unable to contact family during emergencies and unable to carry out payments with my phone when there isn’t WiFi. I can’t imagine worse coverage. I just paid off my phone so that I could unlock it and switch. I cannot recommend enough that you do not switch to T mobile under any circumstances.,0
"Very likely the worst customer service amongst telecom companies. Lost my phone while traveling in Europe, and tried to get a new SIM card to install in a temporary phone one of my family members gave me. Spent €180 in phone calls with them, in which I was told that the first SIM i was sent was not the correct one because it had a protection feature that could not be removed; and after the supposedly “correct” second SIM was received, ran into exactly the same problem. The reps on the phone don’t seem to know anything that has to do with international travel situations, and they refuse to let you talk to supervisors and managers. It’s a total disaster…",0
"In December, I upgraded my phone but decided to return it under their policy and purchased a different one. My trade-in had already been processed, but after extensive conversations in-store and online, I was assured by multiple T-Mobile representatives that the bill credits from the first purchase would transfer to the second.Fast forward a year, and I’ve discovered that wasn’t true. I didn’t notice the missing credits sooner because my bill is already higher than other providers. When I reached out, T-Mobile apologized (Chat Reference ID: 2cd9bf0e-5733-44bc-aae8-ceeffd5fa014) and offered to start issuing the credits now—spread over the next two years until December 2026. But this doesn’t address the almost $500 already stolen from me because multiple people lied to me about transferring the trade in device credits.Under the original agreement, my phone would have been paid off by December 2025, and my bill would have been $40–50 cheaper per month. Instead, I’m stuck paying for their mistake.T-Mobile, I want a refund for the money you owe me, not just future credits. This is unacceptable.",0
"Worst phone carrier ever, do not waste your time. I switched from Verizon for 8 days, had the most horrible phone service I’ve ever experienced, called in to switch back and was told my four lines were closed out and no balance on the account. A month later I receive a phone call from T-Mobile saying I owe $246, as I’ve called in and spoke to someone and their manager they refuse to make it right and because it wasn’t closed out properly (somehow that’s my fault) they are leaving a balance on the account until I pay it. I will never be using T-Mobile for the rest of my life and I don’t recommend it for anyone.",0

"I bought an iPhone for the first time. It was carrier locked through T-Mobile so I called the customer service and the snarky lady on the other end kept asking for an account number though I explained twice that I didn’t have service with them and didn’t understand why they could not use the iMei like every other company I had gone through to look into the issue. The woman was rude and didn’t provide any other info as to what I could do.Needless to say I have a phone I can’t use and I wouldn’t use T-Mobile if they were the last company on earth, I’d write letters and mail them first. Thanks for nothing T-Mobile.",0
"I was quoted a price of $150/month for a new cellphone plan (including two new phones) in-store (3315 Westpark Dr, Houston, TX 77005) and the price I’m actually paying is $90/month higher than what they quoted me. I’ve called customer service and the store multiple times and no one has solved my issue. This is outrageous. It was deceptive. It was a total bait-n-switch. They need to be held accountable for what they promise.",0
"It's unbelievable how difficult it is to get it is to get anything done with their customer service. I signed up for 2 business internet lines, 2 business phone lines with trade-ins.

"Just found out that they changed their policy, when the account is suspended they still charge the full amount.  Last year it was a not so reasonable $10/month, now it is just a ripoff!   Will return the gateway modem from now on, and need it will go pick up a new one....",0
"The people at my local store, refused to help me carry two small boxes inside, from my car. I told them I was physically disabled and all three said no. I had to struggle getting the boxes in.

"Won't go into big story, this company is a money making scamming franchise. I know of a few law suits on them now. The bad thing is the fcc, the US government and others choose to ignore and let them do what they do. This is why we have bad things going on in this world today. Yes some folks are allowed free reign ,however Don't let a no one like me try to some illegal crap, I'll sit in jail until I rot. TMobile is a bunch of crooks and scammers. But their day is coming!!!!😁",0
Terrible customer service I upgraded router to the new one and sent the old one back with ups  now they saying that the was damage because the little paper sticker in the back is scratched and they charged me  79.00 dollars for it . Impossible to resolve issue. Supervisors are useless  and uncaring . I'm ready to drop the whole service . Feels like scam,0
"In July, I signed up for internet service but then learned their speed was inadequate for my needs. I cancelled within 48 hours but was told that the contract gave them 60 days to make the cancellation effective during which time they would bill my card. Customer service assured me that after those 2 months all payments would be refunded to my card. It is now December- 5 months later - and no refund. I called and was told that they will now process the refund. I asked why it had taken so long and was told that they don’t ever make the refund until the customer calls and asks for it. These people are snakes. I will never do business with them again.",0
"F-n HATE this company. I had Sprint since Sprint was Nextel. Then T-Mobile bought Sprint and promised that Sprint customers would go to TMobile towers - LIE #1. They used the same old nonworking Sprint towers. I couldn't even get cell service inside or outside my own condo. And that's a problem as a First Responder in FL, esp during the pandemic and hurricane season when I'm on call. Thankfully I had a separate work phone (Verizon) that worked. As for my responder discount, I've been trying since Nov 2024 (it is now Dec 2024) to verify it using the whackass busted app called T-Life and I'm even on the phone trying to get a person for an hour. Also, upgrades were supposed to come with Costco bucks, but I ain't seen mine yet. Two tin cups with a string would work better than this. Everything about this company is broke, busted and utter crap. GO ELSEWHERE.",0

Your company sucks with lazy minds, and I will tell the world why I feel this way!",0
"I wish I could give 0 , MISS information just to make more money , when they do get the money the response is “ we can’t do anything about it” bought a new phone “on them” and now they want me to pay it off in order to use it internationally when they told me I won’t have to ! Fkn Ridiculous",0
"The WORST service that I’m absolutely dumbfounded. Called to get a receipt for a temporary eSIM. A receipt. 1 hour goes by and they still can’t resolve the issue, I ask to speak to the supervisor who turns out to be the absolute worst person for the job imaginable. The person’s name was AJ. After explaining my situation to him and that I’ve been on the call with them for an hour, AJ had zero apologies but instead began to argue with me over their incompetence 😂 said that their security is just SO good that they can’t access my account by any means. When I said that this experience was disappointing, he has the nerve to argue and say “no it is not” after which I hung up. So AJ if you’re reading this, hope you get fired and work someplace FAR from customers.",0
"Closing this account has been a nightmare.  I have been to the store three times to request that the account be closed, with each time getting a verbal confirmation, yet each month they continue to bill my account.  I have spent countless hours on the phone as well.  I finally had to close our bank account to prevent further charges.  After over $1000 of fraudulent charges, T-Mobile still refuses to provide documentation that the account has been closed, or to refund the charges.  I'm now exploring what to do in response to this fraudulent interaction.",0
I called to get my balance. The representative barely spoke English. He said he couldn't verify me and will not give me any information on my account. I've had the same number for 20 years. I DID understand the part where when I asked he said he was in the Philippines.Shame on you T-Mobile that yououtsource for the sacrifice of quality customer service. I'm looking into another carrier tomorrow!,0
"I would give 0 Star if I could.  We purchased a Home Internet system - Home Internet Plus.  When we were done, they gave us 3 trackers for ""FREE"".  Two days later (including Thanksgiving"", we went to the store to return the trackers as we didn't think we would use them.  We were told that we had to pay $20/each restock fee to return them.  Nobody even asked us if we wanted them when we purchased the system.  They just put in the bag with the  internet package, without explaining any extra possible charges, such as if we lost one and others..  We feel that it was a scam designed by the company or the sales representatives working there were not honest.",0
Would give them a zero!!   Tried to return because internet didn’t work in my house.  Argued for 1 hour with customer service over 1.83.  Was so tempted to just pay it.  The support representative kept telling me it was a legitimate charge but I canceled in the allotted amount of time.   Finally asked for a manager  and they were able to take the charge off.  This is a very bad way to treat customers!!,0
Companies a THIEF helping themselves with other people's bank accounts after REFUSING to issue a confirmation number.. after I've been a customer for 15 years..spend your money elsewhere.. would NEVER recommend..,0
"T-Mobile cheats me when I went to the store on Black Friday at 8:00AM. The saleman told me about T-Mobile Internet and asked me to try out for two weeks free.  I agreed and took the brand new modem home.  By 6:45PM, I returned to the store and returned the new modem back without opening the box.  I told him I'm not interested.  So, I did a paper work and printed me a receipt.Now T-mobile charged me $218.20 including $160 monthly phone service. Don't ever try out with their offer.T-Mobile advertised I can get discount for my old Iphone trade-in for $150. After all transactions, I received an email I only got $45 and I need to get another $90 from Apple.  I canceled my order.Don't buy Iphone from T-Mobile or Phone Service provider. Buy directly from Apple store.  The store does not have what you need and they need to order anyway.",0
"STAY AWAY. A SCAM. In the USA:  I switched to them, found out within two days that I couldn't get coverage at my home or office so closed account.  For SIX months, I've been trying to get a refund for the money I paid since the coverage didn't work. NONE.  Been working on this, they never call you back.  Today, just found out despite escalation there is a clause that says even if you don't use the service you owe that amount.  I switched because I have several friends that have used them for decades all over the world without any problems. DON'T BE TEMPTED.  STAY AWAY.  THEY WILL NEVER HELP YOU.",0
Tmobile sucks and it keeps disconnecting don’t use tmobile if you want to have good connection,0
"I paid off my phone and I switched my service to a new company. I asked T Moblie to unlock my phone multiple times but it is locked for the second week. First time I called I spent 40 minutes on the phone with the T Mobile they told me that the phone is not purchased via T-Mobile so they would not unlock it. I explained that T-Mobile sold me the phone and I used to pay monthly to T Mobile for this phone. She replied that since the phone is not from T-Moble she cannot help me to unlock it. I had to explain again that I have all the paperwork in front of me showing that it was purchased from T-Mobile and in each bill it is stated that I paid for the phone with a final balance to be paid. She asked me to do some resetting and try to unlock it but with no result. Finally  I was informed that I would get an email, and the matter would be taken care of by the technical department and the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. I did not get any email and after 4 days the phone was not unlocked.Next time I called I spent 80 minutes on the line with T Mobile going through settings on my phone and mostly waiting on line. The lady told me that the phone was not used so it cannot be unlocked. I explained that I have been using the phone for a year. She replied: “since the phone was not used the phone cannot be unlocked”  I had to repeat that I just said that I was using the phone for a year. And so on, and so on. Finally she said that the phone will be unlocked for sure this time in 24 hours. But nothing happened. We talked 2 days later and went thru the settings and I was told that the phone will be unlocked in 24 hours. It wasn't. I called 2 days later and I spent 2 hours on the phone with one lady and next another gentleman. Finally he asked me to go to the T-Mobile store. I explained that I already did go to the store but they said they don’t handle unlocking the phones and I have to call T-Mobile. But he explained that I need to go to another location so I did go to find the same reply, “we don’t handle the unlocking of phones, please call T-Mobile.",0
"T Mobile updated their Voice Mail application, and it is no longer accessible.  Called the help desk, and they didn’t know what to do either.  The T Mobile new voice mail application used to work fine, however the new application is broken, and their folks do not know how to fix it yet.",0
Left T-Mobile because they did the bait and switch regarding free Netflix. Now I have a credit balance for $(6.79) and they say they can't access my account without a pin to issue me a refund check. Instead I keep getting monthly statements saying my credit will be applied to next months bill. Worst customer service and a reminder why I left them.,0
"Stopped in a T Mobile store last week to inquire about current promotions that they had. I walked out with a deal that I couldn't say no to and they put it in writing. However a few hours later after talking with T Mobile Customer Service I found out that they performed a Bait and Switch tactic and was signed up for a plan all totally different and much more expensive then was agreed to and put in writing. They told me I was welcome to return the equipment back to the store. When I attempted to return it the next day, T Mobile told me that it is their policy to charge a restocking fee which was huge, over $100.00. I refused told them that I was going to keep their equipment until I receive a call from a higher up supervisor in the company but as of the date so far I never received a phone call after repeated attempts and I am still holding on to their equipment. Needless to say I will never do business with T Mobile ever again",0
"After 20 plus years with this company they did nothing to make things easier. After my rate kept increasing there were no deals to keep my bill at a decent rate for just one line. I switched over to Xfinity and tried to use my Google pixel (that had been paid off completely) and keep my number. I have been waiting over a week to get them to unlock my phone so I can use it with Xfinity. Ever time I call it's the same thing, ""they're waiting for business solutions"". I have been told it takes 10 minutes at the most to unlock a phone. And I have been waiting this long. T-Mobile does not care about their customers. They do nothing to help you out. I really don't agree that they would be voted best customer service.",0
No stars if allowable. They are liars and scammers. When communication with them on social media they’ll block you for leaving a negative review. They are the worst company. Charge you for bills after your number has been ported to another carrier. Reported this on my credit and refused to remove it after they agree it’s their error. I’ve already experienced adverse effects from this from long standing creditors.,0
This company's phone service is terrible. There customer service is shit. They lie to get you in. I canceled my service in August and I am here with another bill in November on hold. These people should be shut down. They are a bunch of theives,0
"I got my first cell phone in 1994, just when cell phones were becoming popular. My service then was through AT&T Wireless.  As you can imagine at that time cell towers were few and far between. My cell service then was 10 times better than it is today with T mobile.  T mobiles’ service is absolutely terrible everywhere I go!!   I’ll be loving as soon as possible and will NEVER return!",0
"Are the customer reps at T-Mobile in a competition to see who can be the rudest and least helpful overall to their clients? That is the only explanation I can fathom for the continued experience I've had with the company over these past three years. On the technical side, I do receive basically reliable phone service and I can live with the bill. While all my devices are eligible for upgrade, and I want to upgrade all of our devices; T-Mobile doesn't want to reach across the aisle with any enticing offers. They are beyond greedy and show no respect for long time loyal customers.",0
"Unbelievable, I had to return a cell phone to T-Mobile and an IPad that was under warranty. The phone is fine but they sent me a different color ipad that was damaged with dents ans scratches. The representative assured me she would call me back to see if I should keep my iPad and return theirs or vice versa, she called me and said hold the iPads I am waiting for an answer but never called back now despite giving them the tracking numbers for both devices being returned they are billing me $1600 !!! Time to leave Tmobile no one can clarify the bill, a new rep is in contact with me who said she will have the old rep call me now the old rep calls back and says they can't take there own damaged replacement back!!!!",0
"If I could give a zero that'd be more appropriate for this review.  I'm on a family plan and was interested in staying with TMobile but wanted off the plan, stay with TMobile and get a new number.  I researched their plans and decided to go with the 55 plus plan as I will be 66 this Friday.  The person at the store was not very interested in helping me or offering any feedback.  Frustrated I  said, ""ok I'll go with AT&T"".  Want to know what he said, ""ok, good luck""  The entire time I was with him he seemed more interested in what he was doing on the computer than helping me so I left.  Went to another carrier and notified my friend who said that's disappointing the lack of interest I was given and she will process this and may follow me to the other carrier.  She's been with TMobile for years but was very disappointed in the lack of professional customer Service and may leave herself.  That's all.",0
"Last year, I was influenced by a T-Mobile ad. I went to their website and it says my rural area in middle Ga, 30 miles outside Macon Ga, was a strong signal area. I ordered their SIM card, and it gave me zero bars. Thankfully, I was refunded. I now have 1 bar (always) with an ATT SIM card.",0
They are definitely liars. Promise you one thing and do something different. It's impossible to talk to an English person let alone a manager. You can't reason with these foreigners. Best you can do is file a complaint with the FCC and Better business.,0
"I’ve been experiencing nonstop issues with T-Mobile. I no longer have service with them, yet they continue to withdraw money from my account every month. When I request them to remove my credit card information from the account, they claim that I no longer have an account, so they cannot access it to remove the information. As a result, they just keep taking money from my account. This situation is absurd and unreasonable, and when I do manage to speak with a customer service representative, the issues persist.",0
Terrible customer service. Utterly incompetent team who messed up my sim and I had to go a week without a phone service because they cancelled my sim and refused to reactivate it so that I can port out. They also took 60 dollars without my permission and without checking compatibility with my phone. It took them 2 seconds to take the money and then cancel my sim. but 5 days before anyone started on working on my issue. they also lied to me and 2 hrs per day on call with they horrible care reps,0
I was a customer for 3yrs with Crooked T-Mobile. Giving up my account for their convenience did me no good. Still”they took their payment April 4th. By the 5th my service was terminated. It was hell from that date on. The whole month they’re sending Tickets to locate the payment. By the end of the month I was drained. Moving on to another carrier was my only option. But”not with slimy T-mobile one can’t move on. They blocked my iPhone as if I owed them money I had prepaid pay as I go. And”it is now 12/23/24 those Crooks never reimburse me my $67.08. I’m on fixed income I’m not rich”I went out a bought Tshirts that reads. I was Robbed by T-Mobile. Join the movement these big companies are to powerful with our money.,0
"T-Mobile was hacked around 2023 and since thenmy phone is flooded with daily text messages askingfor donations to Trump campaign, my opinions aboutRepublican candidates, surveys and messages fromcandidates. Reporting text as junk and delete doesn’t help because random numbers continue.Only eats up my iOS memory.",0
"The instore sales people are wholly incompetent and then fall back on the signed paperwork as what is confirmed.Even if the money to tmobile is exactly the same, they won't rectify anything on their end and will fall back on the contract terms.Woefully incompetent through and through sales/customer service reps and frankly should be a class action lawsuit somewhere.",0
"Worst customer service EVER !!!!  Go to any other phone provider, run go !!!",0
"Their customer service is awful. I cancel their overpriced cell service to get a better deal with a different provider. They still took money from my account. I called and explained to them that I cancelled the service, but they insisted they were right. They were not right. They keep sending me notices that I have a credit that will be applied to my next bill. How can that be when I don't have an account. I have called multiple times to get a refund and I'm given the run around and never get the money I am owed. Today I had to jump through more hoops to finally get the promise of a prepaid card mailed to me. The money NEVER should have left my bank account! I am glad to not be a customer with this company that thinks it is okay to steal from a person's bank account and then have the audacity to make them prove that the money was wrongfully taken out of their account. If you had the correct system of accounts, you would be able to see on a closed account that the customer is owed a refund. Start taking accountability and show your customers some respect. This ordeal has been many months in the making. Glad it is over. I do not recommend this company at all!",0
"Terrible company owes me $1100, was rude; just terrible. Now dragging me along. Stay wat",0
published review 12/5/24I had T-Mobile for over 10 years and I decided to switch last April because the coverage was getting bad. After I switched I called T-Mobile customer service to unlock the phones and cancel my service. Yesterday my wife noticed they have been charging us for months and when I called to get a refund they said that I never cancelled. They have the record of me calling to unlock my phones and cancel those but they kept 1 line and charged me over $165 a month and will not refund my money. They stated that I never requested to cancel a line that I never had. When you sign up the sleazy salesman sign you up for extra lines for there promotions and do not tell you about it. My line had 9 lines and I only have 3 phones and a iPad. Run from this crappy company.,0
Don't buy any accessories through t-mobile!  I have been with them for years but the return window is so short and you can't return anything without doing a live chat.  I spent days using the app and the online system and finally decided to chat with an agent.  It took several tries to get through the automated agent and then I received no help from the live agent.,0
"They are only nice as long as your a customer, but as soon as you switch then thier attuide changes when you talk to um on the phone. They over charge you on your bill and use a phrase called a one time charge to make money after you canceled your service to charge you  7 dollars over and over again",0
NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE A CUSTOMER OF TMOBILEHorrible experience. I have been a customer of TMobile for over 7 years with 4 open accounts and paid my bills on time. I have always had insurance to protect my phones and account. My phone broke on 12/24/24 and I went to the store. They said they could not do anything and go to the insurance. We called the insurance and they sent a new phone. I was on a call to transfer the information from the old phone to the new one for more than 3 hours and TMobile could not do it. They blamed the new phone and ordered a new one to be shipped to the store. They said it would take them about 15 minutes to transfer the information. I was just at the store and TMoblie put the wrong information on the phones and I could not get it transferred. I spent another 3 hours on the phone trying to figure out at the store and the only thing can do is order me another phone that will take another 4 days to arrive. I will be without a phone for more than a week and all TMobile wants to do is to give me a free cheap phone or to upgrade and pay more for a new phone.  The supervisor on the phone did nothing but blame the store or the first customer service representative and did not provide a solution. After 7 years I will bring my business elsewhere since TMobile does not care. It is all about the money to them!,0
If I could leave a zero rating I would.  I was with them for nearly 25 years with always paying them on time.  However switching from their company to another is hell with misinformation and multiple late fees as a result.  I advise if you are starting with a new cell phone carrier to choose any other company.,0
"Switched to a much cheaper service with far superior coverage but can't stop payment at t-mobile because I can't remember the PIN I set over 2 years ago.  So just hop on the t-mobile app and reset my PIN as per their call center IVR ‐ sounds easy right?  Nope, since I'm no longer a customer, I cannot reset my PIN!  Go to the store to find out there are things on my account that don't apply to us like home internet and an iPad, we never had either.  Have we been paying for those things?  Your guess is as good as mine and theirs, they really don't know.  Without a PIN, absolutely no one can help me.  We just paid what we paid and we're still paying and there's quite literally nothing that can be done about it.  No one in the local store and no one in customer service can help me despite all of them being able to tell we canceled the service so I have to pay $40 to stop pay at the bank level.  If you're in the market, find any other company on the planet but this one.",0
"Would give 0 stars if it were an option, Tmobile has overpriced plans. I would recommend basically any other cell service company if you care about what is in your bank account. If you do have Tmobile currently, better watch the amount closely because it can and will change on you with no notice beyond just being present on your billing statement. If you're canceling your bill, you better ask if there are any additional charges because if there is, they will not inform you beyond a letter in the mail like we in the 1960s and they don't have your email address.",0
Run.......The worst customer service.  Two days trying to return a defective tablet.  Nothing but the run around and talked to some many people and a different story with each one!!!  i would NEVER EVER recommed them for tablets.,0
"STAY AWAY!!! After more than 20 years with Sprint/T-mobile, I recently switched phone service to Spectrum about a week before the end of the billing cycle. I was immediately locked out of my online T-mobile account, yet they managed to draft another full month’s payment. I called to request the final bill which took almost another month to receive. I was billed extra for closing my account mid-cycle. So instead of getting a refund, they said I still owed yet a partial payment. I still couldn’t log in to pay the balance, request a refund or anything at all because I no longer have an account. Then once again they managed to draft my bank account for the amount they say I owe. What a terrible company!  So glad I switched to Spectrum. My phone service is so much more reliable and I am paying less than half what T-mobile was charging monthly. I will never go back to them after this.",0
Deceptive.  Offer rebates and promotions that they do not honor.  There’s a class action lawsuit dated 12/8/24 for this.  I hope I can join.  There’s a reason they have 1.5 stars across the board.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with T-Mobile’s customer service and policies. My wife and I purchased a brand new iPhone 14, and after two days, we decided to return it unopened in exchange for an IPhone 15. To our shock, we were hit with a ridiculous $70 restocking fee. The store clerk had clearly told us that we had until Monday (three days after the purchase) to return the phone, especially since we were still deciding between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15.Despite this, T-Mobile refused to waive the fee. We’ve been loyal customers for years, but this experience has made us question our commitment to the company. It’s incredibly frustrating to be treated this way, especially when we followed the store’s instructions. I will seriously reconsider my options moving forward. We’ve since disputed the charge with our bank because a restocking fee is a complete gimmick designed to make more money for a multimillion-dollar company. It makes no sense to charge a restocking fee for a phone that was never opened and was returned just two days later.T-Mobile, please do better—your long-time customers deserve more respect and transparency.",0
"**""T-Mobile SCAM - Broken Promises on Promotions!""**I recently switched to T-Mobile after they called and offered me an incredible deal: $45 per line for four lines, plus four brand-new iPhone 16s if I traded in our existing phones (all newer than iPhone 12 Pro models). This promotion was the only reason I switched over.However, after I joined, T-Mobile conveniently ""couldn't honor"" the promised deal. They claimed the best they could do was $500 off each phone, despite having all the recordings of our conversation. I feel completely scammed by T-Mobile’s bait-and-switch tactics. Be wary of any promotions they promise on the phone—what you hear may not be what you get!",0
"Multiple salespeople tell you that the first two weeks are a free trial period and that you won't be charged anything if you cancel within this period. That proved untrue.Since the access speed was extremely slow, I had to cancel it within a week of activation, and the rep confirmed that I wouldn't be charged anything. I immediately sent back the device. However, after two weeks of cancellation, I received bills asking me to pay a monthly fee plus one-time charge. T-Mobile is now on my blacklist.",0
"Promised excellent coverage in the neighborhood by my house and it turned out to be dropped calls all the time.  I spent a crazy amount of time with customer service and they have done nothing except try to get me to convince the church in my neighborhood to put a t mobile tower on their roof.  Really mobile, it that my job our yours?!",0
I have been a TMobile customer for over 2 years. The prices keep going up service is not great. I have dropped calls no service in areas. Then I get hit with a free upgrade. Guess what it was not free I paid the fees then get my bill to discover I was billed $399 for the upgraded phone. I'm very  unhappy with the service. The customer service isn't much better. My prices continue to climb but I'm not getting anything else for my service. I do not recommend TMobile.  Go somewhere else.,0
T-Mobile is the absolute worst!!! I just got a bill and a debt collector statement on the same day when I canceled my service on October 20. The bill was for October 10-Nov 09. Again I canceled on Oct 20. Oh and it had a $15.50 late charge even though I never got a final statement. Keshayla rep# 1010734 explained to me that even though I only had service for 10 days I had to pay for the entire month and didn't even offer to take off the late charge because she claimed I was texted the final bill which is bull because I never received said text and they don't prorate. Paying for 2/3 of a month that I did not have any service is a ridiculous so they can forget getting my money,0
"Horrible idea for businesses. They will upsell you on promotional lines to reduce your monthly bill but then not close the lines out and continue to charge you for them when you move carriers because their reception is terrible. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
"I'm 70 years old and never have I had a company promise (voice and written) to refund money for a mistake they made, and then take it back!  When I first approached this with T-mobile, they wanted to add the overcharged amount to my account.  However, I wanted them to credit the amount to my credit card instead. After one month discussing this with four different representatives (and hours wasting my time waiting on the phone), I spoke to a manager.  She apologized for the inconvenience and trouble I had experienced with this issue.  She said she would not only refund the money to my credit card but would add another $16 and, in addition, I would not have to pay the next month's bill for $16. She also said she would send a confirmation email, and follow-up with me in one week with a phone call. Sounds good, right?  Well, she did email me the refund confirmation and they did cancel the next month's bill.  However, she never followed up with the phone call, and after a month, the refund still had not appeared on my credit card.  When I called to inquire about this, I was told the company decided to revoke the refund.  A multibillion dollar company revokes a $27.24 promised refund.  How's that for great customer service?!  I'll be quitting T-mobile and would not recommend them to anyone thinking of obtaining their service.  Their word means nothing.  Greedy with no ethical guidelines.",0
"Oh my, where to start? Just for them to install the internet (confirmation of the time and date) and for me to register my account, I had to contact them repeatedly for 2-3 days, like 10-15 times. NO support received ""in the system it seem right"", ""I cannot guarantee"", ""you have to download the APP to register an online account"", ""we don't know how to register an acoount from the browser"" etc... what even was that? never have i ever seen a company so incompetent",0
"I canceled service in October 2024. I called a few weeks later about a refund of the credit balance on my account. I was told that payment would be returned to my bank account after my final bill was generated on November 2. No refund arrived. It is now November 19 and every time I call, the story flips between ""sending it to your bank"" and ""We're sending you a gift card"". I still have no refund. Today, they told me my balance is zeroed out; there is nothing more they can do for me. No accountability and the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing.",0
I don’t have a complaint about wireless service or coverage. I do have a huge complaint about today’s customer Service.  Customer service was not this bad 1 - 2 years ago. Now you call and they don’t listen to you. It’s like they’re told to say you owe them money. I told the last representative that I wanted to talk to his manager and he didn’t want to transfer that call. He kept telling me I owe them money and there’s no need to talk to anyone else. It’s so frustrating and disappointing that T-Mobile hires unprofessional people and please T-Mobile hire people who speaks decent English. I’m done with T-Mobile!!,0
"Having a business account for over six years, biggest mistake was to leave Verizon and go to T-Mobile. I always went to the Bethpage store on Broadway this past January. I got new phones handed my old phones and nothing was ever applied to my account and the promotion was also never applied to my account. I have been calling T-Mobile since February And now we are in December. Not only the corporate office is giving me the runaround and saying I’m really sorry my hands are tied so is the store. At this Bethpage store the crew constantly changes every few months, which is very fishy. My bill has more than doubled and today I received a call From the business department because again I have a business account. She put me on hold she came back on the phone and gave me the same spiel, Which was I’m really sorry I know it’s frustrating. Go to another store. You do the running around. There’s nothing we can do. And if I can give them less than zero, I would",0
1canelle my service after being with t mobile for over 10 years and the continued to charge meIt event cost me and addition 375 dollars as the threatened my credit,0
I was offered a service for moving all my business lines over by James Robertson of T-Mobile via email. None of that agreement played out the way it was supposed to. No one in support will accept an email to adjust bill. I cancelled all service immediately after being told there was no way to get my bill to what was offered.,0
"I noticed I was billed twice in MarchI jump on webchatThe agent stuffs around for 15 minsMakes me fill in a form with personal detailsI input my pin code, forms is submittedMinutes later he says pin is wrong but can still helpMore time passesThen he tells me he can’t help without the pin!!!Ffs - all these companies using useless shitty webchat companies as a fake assistance point need to go out of business. If u can’t give us customer service then stop pretendingWasted time and frustration is the only outcome from using crappy operatorsAnd to lead the customer on for 20 mins is disgraceful. Hope T-Mobile is happy with the fake stats of their agents and the alleged enquiries they handle! More like increasing the distrust and frustration of customers who need resolutionsI should not have to waste an hour to find out why you double billed",0
"Thier customer service is a joke , these people don't know thier ass from a hole in the ground .  USELESS!!!  to the core just hand them your money that's all they're good for. They have no control over changing passwords it's all up to the app developer and that person has awful reviews. But the reps are carrying on like they know what to do and the information they give is all wrong and different every time  Do these ppl even really work there?  Or is this another BS move on americans??",0
Stay away from them.  Spent all day on phone with Customer service over a bill and told nothing they can do switched to them cause we're cheaper than Verizon but guess you get what you pay for they don't value you only how much money they can get out of you,0
"Last fall, my husband added a line to my phone, so total was 2 lines.Then T-mobile kept charging me 3 line for 12 monthes and I haD to call monthly for correct bill even they said bill fixed. So I cancelled one line at November 2024 before the bill due day. then they charge me $160.01 for one line. before was $50 per line. last month I got the refund, this month they charge me again the same extra bill. I have to call the bank to dispute. don't waste your time on this SCAM company !!!",0
"I have been charged, on my credit card, for 10 months for mobile hotspot service after leaving T-Mobile for a competitor.  They ""can't"" stop charging me over the phone.  I have to go into a retail location.  Would be easier to just shut down the credit card.",0
"Absolute worst service and company to deal with. I don't recommend them to anyone. Not only do they lie about products and billing, they don't honor anything they say. We canceled service within 2 weeks, Was told we had 30 days. T-mobile sent us a label to return and said it's within timeframe. We got a bill for $2300 and they say there is nothing they will do about it. So they took returned phones and still billed us for them. Worst customer service ever!!!",0
"Worst experience, Becareful , they are only nice when you sign in and join after no service .. whatsoeverBad connection, bad service, they are only care to charge youWorst overseas service but still they charge you fully Aldo you could barely can get service,Rude and unprofessional costumer service or better say no costumer service or help at all.When you call the don’t give a damn about you.They look for excuse to hang up on youThey do not keep their promises if you request for something.JustWorst phone company in USA",0
Total scam if you are a veteran. They promise Vets a better monthly price to lure them in. Then they offer a ridiculous trade in offer that makes the bill higher than if you don't qualify for a discount.,0
"I used their $50 a month internet service for around two years and it was constant problems.  I'd attempt to get support through the app and it would just report everything was fine and connected when it clearly wasn't.  I could never get a real person to respond.  When I switched to AT&T Fiber it took me six weeks to get my T-Mobile cancelled; they would respond to me and then stop replying when I held my ground about cancelling.  I finally had to take the box into a local store and they said THEY couldn't even help me cancel, but had to call a national number.  I showed them the screenshots of conversations showing I tried to cancel and asked if I could get a refund and they denied.  Then I got a bill showing they had sent my account immediately to collections for the month after I stopped using the service, two weeks into trying to cancel (I had turned off autopay, the one thing I COULD do).",0
I have my sons phone plan payments linked to my checking account and it’s on auto pay for the 29th of every month and evidently it did not come out due to we were homeless at the time and they went into my account on November 8 and just took out the payment without notifying me first which is illegal it’s unauthorized and its theft when I called the girl we just went round in circles and I hung up on her. She called back. I told her to give my money back or report you to authorities that she took out money Out of my account unauthorized and it’s theft!,0
"""After being a devoted T-Mobile customer for over a decade, the recent plunge in their customer service quality has been downright appalling. Each interaction with their support team has been a nightmare—issues are ignored, and the so-called 'assistance' is useless. It's like the company has forgotten that customers are the backbone of their business. Their promises of efficient support are nothing but empty words. I'm beyond disappointed and utterly frustrated. T-Mobile, you need to remember what customer service actually means. Shame on you.""Hope this does the trick!",0
"I can't understand why this company made it so big. Incompetent workers, customer service, high prices, worst company I'm switching after 12 years with them.",0
"Wish I could leave 0 stars. Worst customer service I have ever received from any company ever. From the beginning they tell you that you’ll receive this discount for such and such and so on. Lied about all of it. No discount for new line with phone purchase, no discount for watch purchase with line. Even said here try this internet for 30days free. Showed up on my bill in a week. When I called about not receiving the discounts discussed. They issued a $100  debit card and then canceled it after I received it. Finally switched service, paid my final bill and received another bill a month later. When I called it was another final bill for the watch line they didn’t cancel but charged me for. Called customer service and they said they couldn’t issue a refund but would issue a debit card. Never received it so I called to ask where it was and was told they wouldn’t be issuing one even after I asked for it to be documented. Nope. Run away!!!!!",0
"This is the the worst app I am so sorry I got involved with T-Mobile home Internet.It is constantly getting disconnected. I'm trying to watch a movie and all of a sudden it starts filtering you can't stay connected long enough to watch a full movie.Their Wi-Fi is horrible I went out today using directions I get halfway there and I'm stranded because their T-Mobile Wi-Fi just disappeared and I had nothing I didn't know where I was going they weren't even on my list of connections, they completely disappeared off my phone.I was only 10 minutes away from my home and they're saying that there wi-fi can only go so far, this is ridiculous. They are the worst worst app for internet. Like I said there's not a program I can watch fully without being disconnected.I'm trying to surf the Internet or play some word games you can't do it because it's so slow you get so frustrated you give up.",0
"Do not go for Tmobile, they literally scam you for money. I ordered for a T mobile hotspot, but I received a TCL tablet with sim card. When I called customer service, I was told that fake account with pin was already crerated, I have to go to a nearby t mobile store, I requested for cancellation of my account and autopay. I returned back the equipment within a  month. They have cancelled my account but not the autopay. I got a mail that I have to pay for TCL tablet, eventhough I returned it. Now I am being told that I have to go to near by T mobile store to open my closed account and ask for refund. This is my more than 6 times calling customer service and three times going to T mobile store in a month.",0
"Call to get a $7 late fee removed .because there was a discrepancy in the payment last month. and I have never been late been with the company for 12 years,and they would not do it I do not recommend this company at all",0
"This company does nothing but lie to customers constantly. I spent 8 months being promised working internet coverage and cell phone service at one end of town where it was non-existant. Instead of one month for them to fix the problem it took 9 months before they built another tower that actually worked. They also promised that T-Mobile had agreements with European countries so that my plan included internet coverage in Europe. That was a blatant lie. Out of 8 cities -- it only worked in Vienna. I bought trackers from them because they promised there would be no monthly fee. That was a lie. They started charging the monthly fees after the return window had closed and then refused to accept a return of the sealed boxes and unused trackers. After I finally cancelled all my services with T-Mobile they tried to charge me the full amount for the 4 trackers. When I disputed these charges and won the disputes with Citibank -- T-Mobile tried to bill me again for the full amount of the disputed charges and also threatened me with reporting the debt to credit agencies, even though they are bound by arbitration agreements to honor the dispute decisions in my favor by Citibank.",0
"I am receiving invoices on my email address, even though I never signed up for an account and do not have any relation with T-mobile. It is not possible to log in to T-mobile with the email address, or reset the password to enable login. T-mobile customer service says they will not help at all.",0
"T-Mobile used a bait and switch tactic to get me locked into their service. They talked me into trading two paid and unlocked iPhones for new iPhones 16s “at no cost” if I stayed with them. But they charged me anyway and claimed they made a mistake. As a senior citizen I filed a complaint with my states attorney general. Still, as of now, I’m on the hook for $1600. Run from this company",0
Tmobile sucks always messing things up over charging me really bad but I think all phone companies are,0
"I closed my account and they still took $70 from my bank account. The whole reason I dropped this company is because they keep raising their prices. I used to get $10 a month in discounts and they raised the price $10 so I don't actually get a discount anymore. I can't afford this much per month. I went with someone cheaper with the same coverage and service. When I tried to resolve this, they said they couldn't do anything.",0
Stay away they are absolutely horrible. They convinced me us to leave ATT with the promise of free phones and here we are paying for them. They even went back and listened to the recording and said sorry you are misinformed!! Run away it’s not worth it! Was in the phone 4 hours to get to that nothing resolved except the person they trained and listened to on the recording gave the wrong information. He even called us back the next day to close the deal. But they refuse to do anything.,0
Either there is no one working for T-Mobile that knows the promotions or they are all liars. I recently upgraded to the iPhone 16 I was told I didn’t qualify for the free upgrade to the 16 pro in store then when I called they told me I did qualify and didn’t understand why I was told in store that I didn’t. Long story short I was told that my bill would definitely stay the same and wouldn’t change at all. That was a lie along with a credit that was issued it just disappeared along with my trade in amount for my old phone. I’ve been with them for 23 plus years I’ve always had several lines but with my recent experience I will be changing companies completely after the current phone that was supposed to be free is paid off.If there is a lawsuit against this issue with them I’d like to join in what they are doing to customers is not legal at all. PLEASE DONT USE T-MOBILE.,0
There was a 30 day trial period for switching to t-mobile.  If you switched from another carrier to t-mobile and switched back within 30 days they would reimburse you 150.00.  We tied tmobile and were unsatisfied with their coverage and service.  we switched back to verizon witinin the 30 days of starting tmobile and called tmoble customer service and started a claim for the 150.00.  The customer service rep stated that we were within the 30 days and expect a check mailed to address.  If we did not get the check wining 30 days call back.  Today 10/10 i called customer service at tmobile and stated never received money they said that the claim was denied because i did not re-claim my 150 with in 30 days of initial claim.,0
"I was a customer of t mobile for proabaly a  YEAR maybe more,Every other Month my bill would be higher ,I would have to call them talk to one of their  managers and get it straighten out it didn't matter the next bill would be fine the next bill would always be higher, the last time was the last time  I just quit them as i told them I would if it kept happening Now I found a new company  but still have the phone from t mobile,I have no use for it but refuse to pay when they keep trying to over charge me my bill was $45.00 a month not $69.00.like i said every other month .I have kept records but might have thrown them away.they keep a log of all phone calls so I can prove if I have to what they were trying to do ,my son also quit them for the same reason.now I get warning letters along with a raise in what I owe for BEING LATE.I HOPE THEY DONT HOLD THEIR BREATH  THEY ARE DONE ROBBING ME",0
"If you want the too long don't want to read.  Do not use T Mobile.  They are a terrible company.  Pay the extra 10-15 a month per line for a real telecom provider.T Mobile as a company is simply not in compliane with Federal Trade Communication guidelines and generally does not adhear to business practices set by the local Chambers of Commerce for each and every region within the United States they operate.I decided to try out the service, it bare functioned.  The modem died, I tried to get it repaired.  They added to much friction to that process and actively refused to repair the T Mobile 5G modem.  Come today.  I have a $500 USD bill for services not rendered as they were keeping the account running for what appears to be 6 months even though it's a month to month contract (auto renew without consent is against several FTC guidelines and policies).  They made it very difficult if not impossible to cancel my account.  They've designed so that you have to call them and they spend 30 minutes trying to keep you as a customer.  I'm sure I cancelled the account in the past but here it is.I called today to see if they could make it right.  They made course of action except to pay the debt collection agency.  Their service was sub par and quite frankly it was a terrible experience overall.  If you operate an Authorized T-Mobile reseller or repair center.  Quite frankly I would find a more honest company.  The negative karma you're generating working for T-Mobile will come back to haunt you.A final note.  To any open source projects such as OpenStack or any other project managed by the CNCF or OpenInfra Foundation.  Please do not accept code commits from a company which does not operate ethically and within the guidelines of what I believe are pretty normal business practices.  Their customer service personal are trained to ""handle"" customers, they are not trained to resolve issues.",0
I’ve had T Mobile for about a year and half now.They made an arrangement with me to pay a bill but they made the arrangement for back to back days and I told them that I could only afford the one payment. I made the payment but they shut off my service. After discussing the matter with them I made another arrangement and they promised not to turn the service off They turned it off twice in less than two weeks. They did this after promising that they wouldn’t. The rep then lied to me even though I have the text messages from 611,0
Keep and switch is a scam. I was told by the representative when I purchased the phone that I was eligible for a promo credit. After completing the application I was denied because the information was entered incorrectly. The rep said she would reenter and to check my status again in 30 days.  Denied again.  Called customer service and they told me that it was denied due to a duplicate that said it had already been awarded. It was escalated to another team to fix and I’m still waiting. I submitted the original request on 8/15. It’s now 10/15 and TMobile can’t seem to fix this issue that is with their own system. Their customer service team just consistently apologizes but they haven’t been able to do anything. I will continue to call until this is resolved but rest assured I won’t be telling anyone to use TMobile. $750 later.  Maybe I’ll eventually get my $$$. Think twice before switching.,0
Have been with this company for a while and always paid my bill. When one of my family members who is on my account died they wouldn't even extend my due date. So that I could pay and attend the funeral. Just so they could charge me and additional 80.00 in late fees. This company is all about thier money not their customers. They simply do not care.,0
"SCAM ARTISTS AND CON ARTISTS!! I have been using tmobile home internet in our camper since 2023. I went with this option because I was told by multiple employees including the store manager that I could take it on the road to use in multiple locations as I live in my camper. For $55 a month I couldn't complain. I have been using this for over a year with NO issues and now am being told I need to pay 2.9 times more ($160 on autopay) for their new ""away plan"" for the EXACT same service I have been using. The home internet will now be geo locked to one location so you can't take it anywhere. The rich have to stay rich and they will find ways to make more money for providing the same service",0
"I can’t believe this guy from T-Mobile have the nerve to ask me when I call back. Are you calling back to join back up with T-Mobile? I said are you out of your goddamn mind I closed down my account on October 5 and I went in the store, I said I would like to pay off everything I owe so I paid $233 on October 5 a month later I receive a bill for $312 and they said this is my final bill. I know what was the last bill that I paid they’re just making up a bunch of crap we get this. My phone still has a Sim lock so I just called up today. This is six months later and even though I paid that $312 they charged interest on it I’m telling you right now stay far away from T-Mobile. They are the crook and worst company you have ever been with in your life. My company and me. I am done with Verizon Print. I feel bad that Sprint went to T-Mobile cause Sprint was decent and T-Mobile destroyed T-Mobile you guys need to go to hell you’re crooked you’re dishonest your liars and you’re the f in  tallyban this company has bin laden written all over it",0
"T Mobile has changed in the three plus years since we joined.  When we signed up, we opted for the then highest rate plan. Now that plan is not only a ""legacy"" plan, we receive fewer considerations for deals than someone with their bottom most rate plan, which is still a lower price than we pay.T mobile basically changed nothing but the name and wants to charge my family more per moth for the privilege of signing up for that.When you call customer service, they will make a deal with you, but tell you that the ""back office "" needs to approve it.  Then they will wait two weeks and finally call you to tell you that the ""back office"" has declined the deal and try to force you into the more costly new plans at no benefit to you.This is the essence of dishonest negotiations.Meanwhile, ATT is offering essentially the same service, at a lower price, and will still extend customers the trade in deals.  I think that it is only a matter of time before we change back to ATT.",0
"No one cares or knows what they are doing. I have a mechanical issue with my phone and have been bounced around between T-Mobile and the insurance company, Assurant, a million times. Then, they finally agree that it is on T-Mobile to replace it. I filed my replacement over the phone and it said I would get a replaced in 24 hours. 48 hours later, no phone, so I call, get bounced around, and find out it was denied, but no one told me. Then, I have to trouble shoot including factory resetting my phone, which is fine. It doesn't work and I am told a replacement will be sent and it will be an upgrade as mine is not available. I don't get an email in 24 hours as they say I will, so I call 30 hours later to find out a replacement order was never put in. This time it is replaced, but they won't honor the upgrade. They say they will review the phone logs and get back to me regarding what the rep promised me. A few days later, no call, so I contact them again. I promised they will review the phone logs and get back to me. Three days later, nothing, so I contact them again. Supposedly, she called, but she didn't leave a message or make in any notes in my account. No one is willing to look at the calls, contact either rep that said they would look at the calls, or contact the rep who made the promise. About 10 days dealing with this. After almost 20 years with T-Mobile and I am walking away and will NEVER EVER come back.",0
"I’ve been dealing with T-Mobile for months, and it has been an absolute nightmare. In June 2024, I ordered a 5G internet plan and a Go 5G phone plan. Despite never receiving the order, I’ve been charged every month. I've made countless calls and sent emails, but there's been no resolution. Every time I speak with a customer service agent, I'm told a different story, full of empty promises and lies. It’s beyond frustrating.What’s worse is that I’ve been receiving constant threats that the charges will be sent to collections, despite their reassurances that it would be corrected. It's been over three months, and I still haven’t received a refund for the order that was never delivered. This company is acting more like a scam than a reliable service provider. It's unbelievable how such a large company can operate with this level of dishonesty and incompetence.T-Mobile, you need to do better. I feel like I’ve been duped, and no customer should have to go through this! Beware of their false promises and lack of accountability",0
"I have been with T-mobile for many, many years the call quality is solid  however, the customer service is by far the most subpar, well below standard customer service I have ever dealt with agents and supervisors are apparently only allowed to stay on script and can in no way vary to provide actual customer service. The automated system is set up to ask you the same questions a minimum of 3 times each before it will transfer you to an agent and the agents make it clear that they will do no more if not less the what the automated system can do, and do not let me even get started on the procedures they make up and put in place that get you to go into the store where the store associates then look at you lost and say “I’m not sure why they told you to come in for that? We will have to call customer service!” An overseas agent set up my initial business account over the phone and completely misspelled my name. It to 2 years to partially clear this up and the random name now appears on my credit report. I sadly wish I was making this up lol. This is just on scenario.",0
"Had 3 online support people straight up lie about correcting an issue.  They just told me what they thought I wanted to hear.  One actually looked legit, had email exchanges, ect.  Had 24 hours to sign a digital document but it was cancelled about 10 hours, never giving me a chance to even see the email and sign.  Then the last one told me to watch my inbox for a confirmation which never came.  They intentionally lied, and I would advise anyone to stay far away from this unethical place which cuts your unlimited Internet to unusable speeds worse than 1997 dial up.  Now I am done with them and want to spread the word about this terrible place.  Yes I have screenshots, emails, confirmation numbers to T-Mobile manipulative games.  They wasted my time, and never had decent intentions of resolution.  They are awful, they lie to customers and it's time to tell the world about T-Mobiles ethics (they have none), because they do not need to be in business any longer due to these practices.  They have had class action lawsuits about this in the past, never learned the lesson.",0
"Horrible customer service. I was a 20 year customer and the past couple of years the customer service has taken a nose dive. After T-Mobile customer service kept messing with my account because autopay failed to work, I was locked out of my account without a PIN and there after customer service would not help me since I had no PIN.I ported my numbers out to another company and T-Mobile continued to make it difficult to even pay my last bill. I paid my final bill using the web page address in the final bill letter to pay as guest. I thought I was finally done but that was not the case.I ended up getting a call from a collection agent stating I owe T-Mobile for the final bill. I provided REF# from my payment and I still could not get it resolved.I ended up filling a complaint with FCC and got an email from T-Mobile Executive Response Team. I called the ERT member as asked in the email and we finally spoke. ERT argued with me telling that the account was not in collection and disagreed with me about being called by a collection agent. He was able to locate payment and apply to my final bill. But even though the issue was resolved the customer service was still bad and only got resolution since it was a FCC complaint.",0
"fri pm switched to t-mobile, clerk said he could transfer my contacts and pictures,  did not happen.  went back mon to have them try again.  young female clerk could not make the transfer, or answer other questions on the cat s22. all she could say was she hates this phone. switched back to my other carrier.  lost $41.90 for nothing.",0
"Signed up for T-Mobile Home Internet about 6 months ago. I was promised a $200.00 gift card for switching from Spectrum. Guess what, NO gift card. I have talked to them on the phone, text and email. All with the same answer, it was approved but not sent. It's been 2 months now. No holding my breath.",0
"Shady, shady, shady. They told me in order to get an upgrade (mind you, I haven't upgraded in over 3 years), i need to upgrade my plan - a $24 increase per month. Without doing this, I have to pay $490 for a new phone up front and the rest gets billed monthly. I upgrade my plan,  to then see that now I have to pay $700 upfront and I'm told that's a great deal and perk by tmobile. I have been with them for over 17 years and can do much better with Verizon,  AT&T or spectrum mobile. They didn't want to let me return my plan to what it was before, but was able to finally get them to. I guess tmobile is hurting after that huge law suit they have to pay everybody out over the data beach so to make up for it, they give you misleading information, catchy buzz words and lies to con you into spending evergreen more money on their awful product.Will never trust them again and I'm leaving them after 17 years. (Also now that I'm looking at other carriers, I see average rates for my $100 plan with tmobile ranges anywhere from $50-$80 with other carriers. Wish I left these shady people sooner.",0
"T-Mobile is dishonest and disgusting. My problems are twofold. Since the beginning on 2024, I had three warranty exchanges of my Samsung S22 handset. With each warranty exchange, T-Mobile sent a LOCKED device although my initial phone was unlocked. Calling customer service is useless as there is no resolution despite the seemingly understanding attitude from representatives who are not allowed to deviate from the script. Among the various answers for receipt of a locked phone were the exchanged phone must be on the account 90 days. Parenthetically, I paid a fee on each exchange although I was replacing a defective phone T-Mobile sent me less than one month prior.  The second issue that occurred twice involves T-Mobile stating they did not receive the damaged phone and then billing a $1500 no-return fee. In each instance, T-Mobile eventually found the phone the returned - one month later - stating the wrong IMEI was keyed in when received at their warehouse. Twice?? It seems T-Mobile has internal theft problem and would rather pass the expense onto the consumer rather than clean their house.",0
All I have to say is SCAM ALERT.Don’t trust them they will SCAM you.Just read all their reviews. Everyone is saying they’ve been scammed and my wife and I have experienced ourselves. I would highly recommend leaving them and going to ATT. Same plan better service and at least you know you won’t be scammed,0
There is no way in Hell I would do business with any company that associates themseives with Snoop Dogg!! What a piece of garbage.,0
"T-Mobile in person has mostly helpful people, but many things need to be done online or on the phone.  The 611 phone customer service people are so incredibly inept it is 😤😡. I just sat on the phone for 2 hours and they could not set up a simple account for me. They kept putting me on hold without explaining what the problem was. When they asked for my social, I told the woman I had been a victim of identity theft, so I would have to get off the phone with her and release the freeze on my credit account. She said no need, they just needed my social on file. I sat for another hour on the phone before someone in the credit department came on to say I needed to release the freeze on my credit. I said ""I told the other woman that an hour ago!"" What is wrong with you? Do your people not know what their job is? Why does the person setting up the account NOT know what she is asking?!",0
"T-Mobile states that once you agree to their plan, you bill will never go up. Ok. Sounds great!! Count me in!! Uh, except that is not true. My first bill was higher and the second bill was higher than that!! After spending hours on the phone with customer service, ""we can't do anything. The store manager will have to make those changes"". The store manager quoted me a price that was the correct price, but the bill is more. Oh guess what? Since you've been trying to get this problem fixed, ""we've suspended your service"". Now that's how you treat a new customer!! Lie to them. Charge them more than they've agreed to, then, cut them off when they ask what about the ""you bill will never go up"". Outstanding. No wonder they don't check trustpilot and respond to their reviews. They know exactly what they are doing. As always, should've checked trust pilot before committing. Lesson learned.",0
They said we would get 4 new phones for switching.  Guess what older phones aren't eligible for trade in.  Coverage area stinks in our area.Too bad we switched from Verizon.,0
I was scam with T-Mobil and I was a customer since the call voice stream  the total amount was 691.00 they said I had contact and everyone knows they no longer do contacts. I left them because I went to their Georgia Ave location and someone hack into my and from this happened it was down hill for me. Please beware of t-mobile. This why I changed my services.,0
I bought a screen protector “for life” for $50. meaning - they said - if mine cracks I just stop by the store and get a brand new one for free.well mine cracked and I went to the store and they said they have no records of me buying it but if I want I should purchase it again so I can have it.so basically they’re telling me to pay twice for the same service. I went to different T-Mobile stores and they say the same thing.ABSOLUTE SCAM. DO NOT recommend.,0
Wifi goes out every 15 minutes. They’ve claimed to be “fixing” it multiple times and I’ve seen little to 0 progress. Do better.,0

Had trouble from the very beginning. Overtime the service got worse and worse. Finally cut it off today. We have been without internet for days now.,0

"I became a New T-Mobile customer in December of 2023. I got reeled into getting the 5G Home Cell internet service on a trial basis. I got COVID and was unable to bring the unite back in until after the trial period ended, on January 23, 2024. I brought it back because it sucked worse than my DSL. I live in a rural area. T-Mobile did not give a crap & said I would be charged a prorate for the time I had it. Fine, I just didn't want the service and so I asked the T-Mobile rep to cancel it. I also called T-Mobile right after, to let them know to cancel it. T-Mobile's website was problematic. Many times, I was kicked off the website or the website was non-responsive and I was unable to see my account online and so I gave up. I trusted that T-Mobile would charge me for just the cell phone service I signed up for. BIG MISTAKE! I was able to get online without a problem 2 days ago and noticed that T-Mobile is still charging me for equipment I don't have and service I cancelled, that I cannot even utilize without the equipment I turned into T-Mobile back on January 23, 2024. I immediately called T-Mobile and their customer service rep said that they have record of me returning the equipment on January 23, 2024 but they don't have any record of the separate call to them I made, cancelling the 5 G internet service that I cannot even use without the equipment I turned into them. T-Mobile is refusing to refund the $540.00 of false charges over the past 12 months. the T-Mobile rep blamed me for the charges for the service, I was not receiving, because I did not monitor my account & that I did not call T-Mobile to let them know I was being charged for a service I cancelled on January 23, 2024. I am on auto-payment and paperless billing that the T-Mobile's customer service representative sold me on and gave me discounts for agreeing to use, when I signed up. I feel that T-Mobile promotes auto pay & paperless billing on purpose, so that you don't catch T-Mobile right away, in their theft. These charges are fraudulent and T-Mobile knowingly stole my money for equipment and service T-Mobile knows I didn't have and am not even able to use without their equipment. My 5G T-Mobile cell internet # was 928-266-7382. I have filed a complaint with the FCC & the FTC. I will look online to see what other agencies I can file a complaint with, to get my stolen money back.",0
This company has been nothing but difficult to communicate with and would highly not recommend. Made a great product impossible to deal with.,0
"BUYER BEWARE!! The location at Meadowood Mall in Reno, Nevada is a third-party contracted locale. And they have NO IDEA how T-Mobile works. We just left T-Mobile after 15 years as our carrier because of their incompetence, and due to every customer service rep, retail clerk, tech support, manager, heck, you name it, we've spoken with for the last year, who refused to repair the problem created by the creatures at this store. No one wanted to fix the clearly erroneous handling of our new phones and watches by the idiot who sold them to us. We were passed around, placated, and eventually they all went silent.Our little over $300 month bill jumped to almost $600, simply because the person didn't know how to input information, and no one would fix it afterward. We went to three (3) different T-Mobiles in our town, and nothing. Have spent hours on the phone with these cretins. Nothing. I even emailed a manager at the location on Keystone Avenue, AFTER he asked me to. (A little bit after he told me to, to be clear.) Still. Nothing.Stay away from T-mobile. They don't care about you, until you leave. Then you get a 'sad face' from the guy unlocking your phones, and 'why are you leaving?'. Um, read our notes. They are 10 times more lengthy and detailed than this review. Literally cried in two of their stores because of how we were treated. Go to Spectrum, Verizon, heck, get a burner phone. Do anything but business with these people. They want your money, and care less about your loyalty.",0
"I left t mobile for spectrum, and they hit me with a $173 bill after I had already paid their ""final bill"" at the time I switched carriers.  Total scam!!!",0
Customer service is a total JokeThe 5G service is great but the app and support are embarrassing bad.,0
"Three times I encountered this TMoble Rep from Westfield Topanga Mall, Los Angeles, Ca and the experience was just rude and traumatic.  The first experience was a roughly a year ago.  I came in the shop and he was standing by the door.  I inquired about upgrading my phone and he was impolite and sounded not interested to help me, he simply said, ""ok choose your phone in the displays"" and did not even offer to open my account.  I dismissed the experience and went out of the shop discourage about pursuing my intention to upgrade.  I never forget his face.  then almost a year later I went back with my wife to ask about the status of our account (how much we pay monthly, are we eligible for upgrade etc) the first thing he said to me was ""you don't know how much you pay on your bill? sounding sarcastic and irritated that i requested him to open my account.  I let that experience go because i was tired and in a hurry.  the third encounter with AJ was today Nov 17, 2024.  Two hours ago. And it was horrible. We came in with the intention to upgrade our phones.  He opened our account and told us that we need to pay our overdue bill first.  We were surprised of the unpaid bill because we thought we are on auto debit.  But he said sarcastically ""No you haven't paid last month's bill"".  that what it means by ""overdue"" sounding like we don't understand what the word means.  So this finally into me and reacted with all the bottled feelings i have had in the previous two encounters.  I told him this is the 3rd he has been rude to us and he accused me of making up stories and of raising my voice. And he said he has the right to refuse service and told us to leave in front of all the customers.  He is a liability to your brand.  The lady representative who was beside us was not helpful either. I know the shop is closing for the day but that is no reason to be horrible to the customer.  This experience is not acceptable.",0
"""I have had the absolute worst experience with T-Mobile. Due to their negligence and lack of competent customer service, they wrongfully sent my account to collections! Despite making all payments on time and having no prior issues, they somehow managed to mismanage my account information, leading to unnecessary and undeserved damage to my credit score.When I reached out to their customer service to rectify their mistake, I was met with endless excuses, confusion, and no clear path to a resolution. Instead of taking accountability, their representatives passed me around from department to department with no one willing to fix their mistake. It’s evident that customer care is NOT a priority for T-Mobile.Their incompetence in handling this situation has caused me stress, wasted my time, and left me to deal with the unnecessary burden of clearing my name with the collections agency. I trusted T-Mobile with my service and they completely let me down. If you value your credit and your peace of mind, stay far away from T-Mobile!""",0
Worse customer service and always steals money from customers through overcharged bills,0
We got a hot spot for our camp ground and it didn’t work at all. Spent time on the phone with  a person trying to troubleshoot our issue.  The issue was the hot spot wasn’t strong enough for our area.  We had an emergency and needed the WiFi and we were out of luck.  So the very next day. We went to a store and got a portable WIFI.  Which has served us well.  So now we have a hot spot that we want to return and they are making us pay for something that doesn’t work for a total of 2 years. I think this is horrible customer service.  We have our cell phone service through them and they do t really care. They are still making us be responsible for this bill. We are retired and can’t afford to pay for something that doesn’t work.  I am so frustrated with the service that we have received. What are we supposed to do?,0
"They make so much profit, but why is it impossible to make a good website for refilling your prepaid card???? Never again",0
"My experience with T-Mobile has been nothing short of a nightmare. I own a fully paid-off iPhone 14 Pro Max, and after renewing my business with T-Mobile by getting an iPhone 15 on credit, I reached out to unlock my old phone so I could send it to my brother, who is serving in the U.S. Army overseas.Initially, they assured me that unlocking the phone would be easy. However, after 10 days of waiting, they suddenly claimed I was 36 hours late on my bill and pressured me to pay. Despite the fact that the iPhone 14 is no longer tied to my account, I paid the bill, only to receive even more excuses for why they couldn’t unlock it.The absurdity is that this paid-off phone is free to be activated by any random person wanting to sign up for a T-Mobile line, even a stranger or my ex-wife. I even called pretending to be someone else, provided them with the IMEI number, and they were ready to sign me up with no questions asked—as long as it was with them! Ironically, they claim they can't unlock the phone.To add insult to injury, my brother was ready to sign up with T-Mobile but needed the phone unlocked to use a local SIM while deployed. Instead of facilitating his needs, T-Mobile’s ridiculous policies have forced them to lose a military servicemember’s business. They’ve also lost mine; as soon as I finish paying off the new phone I bought from them, I’ll be moving on.If you’re thinking about choosing T-Mobile, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. You won’t be able to sell or gift your old phones; they’ll just become expensive trash. Instead of upholding their legal obligations, T-Mobile drags their feet and makes excuses. They’re full of it, and I can’t recommend them to anyone seeking reliable and ethical service!",0
"I was previously a T-Mobile customer for years. They kept increasing the bill, and the customer service continued to be lower. The phone prices and incentives were less and less. I got really tired of paying full price for a new phone every two years and not getting a discount or any kind of incentive for my kiddos phone line. After I switched my number to a new service, they sent me a bogus charge of $103.46, claiming ""equipment not returned."" What equipment? I had my phone fully paid off and I didn't have any other equipment? I tried to call customer service and they said they couldn't help me without some six digit pin. I had no idea what it was because I never use a pin when I call they verify me through a text message. When I escalated the call to a supervisor, the supervisor basically said they couldn't help me either and I had to go into a T-Mobile store with my ID to be verified. I understand having security measures but when you're not even a customer anymore and you can't even have a manager tell you what the charge is for over the phone and that's the only information you're requesting that is a broken system. I offered to give my drivers license number my Social Security number my email address, have an email verification, and five other solutions but they refused to do anything without some obscure pin I don't even remember making when I first signed up..Needless to say, I will never use this service again and I don't recommend anyone else comes here unless you want to overpay for your phones and not be able to be helped with your bill.I say this as somebody who works in customer support, and knows how systems can be created to truly help people.",0
They took 1731.96 out of my account for phones I sent back. The shipping labels proved they received them and they still charged me and refused to give me a refund.,0
"I have not received my rebates!  I have reached out a total of 5 times-months later no rebate!  I will be calling corporate tomorrow, followed up by a call to the BBB.  Nothing but lies, deception, aggravation and anxiety dealing with T-mobile!  You call and the call gets directed to the Philippines.  Second, i specifically asked to speak to the “retention team”.  I asked them “why should I stay with T-Mobile?  I switched carriers AND bundled home internet.  There was an incentive of a total of 300$ in rebates.  Thats not true, I have not received my rebate incentives.  The day I switched carriers verizon offered home wifi and for less money than t-mobile.   So please tell me why should I stay with T-Mobile?  Your job is a retention specialist tell me…why should i stay?” (Anne) listed a bunch of services ATT, VERIZON and many other competitors offer.  She discussed my bill that was due 2 days ago.  I explained “I was aware of my obligations, and told her that they did not answer my question! “.  Now they got a supervisor on the phone.  He was about as useful as a pair of tits on a bull!  Regurgitated the same bs as the previous person.  I asked him the very specific question…”why should I continue to be a T-mobile customer?  He went on about the services and i told him (Dave) your competitors offer that too and for less money…The retention team did not answer the question and failed at their task.i was with ATT cellular for 20 years (and probably another 20 before that with the old landline!  I left them, because I did not feel valued.  (New customers were getting better deals than myself and i had to ask for comparable discounts.)  i was with verizon for 3 years and switched for the incentives.  Like i mentioned earlier the day i switched they came out with a promo for less money in a home internet plan than what i was NEWLY paying at t-mobile.  Now no rebates?  Yes I will be reaching out to Bbb, corporate, and bringing this to the attention of some litigious lawyers.  Bring on the class action suit!WTG- Mike Seivert!",0
T-Mobile really sucks. They gave me a price for two internets at $60 a month. Three people from the store said that a week later I get a bill from them for $90. I haven't even done my trial. And they're already charging me. So I go back in the store to say it's supposed to be only $60. Will I get a different guy? And he says oh those people were misinformed. They didn't know the sale went off so they wouldn't honor it. So I brought my stuff back before I even finished my trial.. called them to get my $90 back and you have to have a PIN number so I had to go back to the store and figure out what my PIN number was. Finally a month later they send me out a statement saying that I have a credit of $52 which is BS. So I call him to tell him no. You owe me $90. They can't help me because I need a PIN number which I don't have which I don't know. So they can't help me at all. I have to go back to the store to get a PIN number. If you're thinking about using T-Mobile don't please don't,0
It's ridiculous that their system requires I remember account number when I have been using online services only.IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD  and aggravating that I can't even contact assistance through the chat without remembering the account number.,0
"If I could leave a zero I would.  I signed up for the internet service, which didn't work well in my home.  I cancelled it literally days later.  The process to cancel was easy and the person who helped me was great.  The following month I get a bill for $2.50.  I go online to try to pay the bill and am unable to get into my account since it is closed.  I attempt to pay as a guest, no luck.  I open a chat for help.  They tell me that I need to call to pay.  So, the next day, I call to make the payment.  Of course t-mobile uses a call center somewhere outside of America and the person I speak with speaks broken English, so explaining the situation and understanding him is not ideal.  He tells me I need to go onto the app to create a pin in order to verify who I am, so that I can make a payment.  We go back and forth and I finally ask to speak to a manager, which he refuses to transfer me to.  So even though I have my account number and am able to verify any information they need me to, they are unwilling to let me make a payment without a pin.  Which is interesting since I didn't need a pin to actually create an account with new service.  Makes perfect sense.  So now, I will have to waste more of my time to go into the store for $2.50.  Thanks T-mobile for making it so difficult to simply pay a bill.",0
The worst company ever. They’ve blocked everything without reason. It’s says I haven’t paid the bill even though I paid on time and never missed any. The internet is not working most of the time. It’s scam,0
"I've been experiencing some ongoing issues with my phone, and after contacting T-Mobile, I was able to get a replacement device. However, the replacement turned out to be defective as well. I reached out to T-Mobile again, and they provided another replacement, which also had issues. Frustrated with the situation, I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to seek assistance in resolving the matter and obtaining a fully functional phone.After filing the complaint, I was contacted by a T-Mobile representative named George, who informed me that the only option available was to provide me with a fifth refurbished phone. When I expressed my concerns and asked why I couldn't receive a new phone given the recurring problems, he mentioned that they didn't have the specific model I had in brand new condition. He also suggested that the only alternative would be for me to purchase a new phone.As a long-standing business customer of T-Mobile for the past eight years, I'm disappointed with the treatment I've received and the inability to resolve this issue in a satisfactory manner.",0
They  charge too much for this sh** box.  It 's always stuck on the low setting  and you have to unplug it every time to get  my television to work . I cant watch golf now. Switc h to get your club on . Bossman Husk.,0
"T-Mobile uses deceptive promotions, by saying you have to be targeted to qualify while at the same time trying to get you to change plans when in the detail description of the promotions never mentions anything about having to be targeted, I am a customer of over 20 years dating back to Sprint",0
T-Mobile is a complete damn scam. I paid the bill. That’s why I got rid of my phone. I didn’t like the service I’m on the phone talking to it’s  cut off. I paid the bill. They bill me for $1.25 keep adding me fees for Phone that I don’t have. That’s why I got rid of the complete scam.,0

I gave 1 star because it was the only way I would be able to write this review they careless about your situation at all it's like my phone was hacked I just kept getting an echo or when I dial a number I would get nothing but the phone would hang up on its on this went on for 4 day technician suppose to call back didn't happen 09.29/2024 to present this happen billing cycles change when their ready to change them if your out of work and can't pay your bill T mobile could care less even though their is a past record of you paying the bill 3 days later they still got their payment so no I would not recommend T mobile to no one un reliable they lie allot say what they think you want to hear,0
The worst company and network carrier ever.,0
Very bad services. Extra charges that are not suppose to be there.,0
"I was with Tmobile for over 20 years. The only payment I missed was after Hurricane Wilma in like 2004. I didn't have service that entire month. It all started in June when I returned a old Samsung Flip phone 3. The Screensaver separates at the fold. It is my 3rd one. They sent me a refurbished one. When I sent it back on time!!!! I saved the receipt it was never scanned at the warehouse. Long story short, 5 months later, 12 hours on the phone and 2 trips to the store. They constantly took out and put in $1100 and $2200 out of an account that I only use to pay bills. Not only does it come out. It is constantly ""pending"". So I have multiple times it goes in and out. So I call all the time. I was very nice in the beginning. Wells Fargo told me to immediately take them off bill pay. After it was finally settled. It happened again!!! My 0 balance went to $1279 because they kept hitting me with late fees. The customer service rep said I should have had the money to cover the $1100 in good faith. 17× my $65 bill. Now I have $2200 in my Wells Fargo account that they can't take out!!! I called them and let them know that I have their money. The lady got me so mad. I went to Patriot Mobile. I am waiting on the SIM card. I called one more time to talk to a supervisor. Another 44 minutes on hold. So now 12 hours. He said he was the number one guy in the entire USA at Tmobile. He said it would be 3-5 days until he EMAILS his team. I said you are a phone company and you can't call them? I said you don't understand...I am not going to be your customer in 5 days! They don't give a crap!! It is a bunch of kids and foreigners. They don't care about the company. They can't deal with a 61 year old retired buisinessman who doesn't tolerate foolishness. Find another company.",0
I was talking with a customer service manager about resolving a bill issue and they were going to help out if I made a specific payment which I did and they were going to follow up the next business day to finish the agreement by that time they went and deducted the original payment which ended up to 460 total and been trying to rectify the situation but not getting anywhere no matter who I speak with in customer service they all basically say we don't care.,0
"Honestly,  had a great experience up to 9/24-9/26.I have recently had lost my job and had a temporary part time job and had made a payment arragement that I really thought I could make it work.When I realized I would not be able to pay I called,  spoke to a rep.  All she could do was take my payment off so that checking account wouldnt overdraft. This was 9/22. I was told to call back on 9/24 after suspension to see what I could do.Chat on 9/24, the rep has no notes (I guess they don't write those on accounts anymore) so I have to repeat the whole process again.  They tell me there's nothing they can do. Even when I try to set up a payment for the 27th (I had a very small amount coming in). Nothing they can do.9/25 my van gets a radiator leak and hurricane Helene forms. I'm using chat,  had to go through the process all over,  get nothing but tolf to call the 1888 number because the hurricane might change that.   I call and start the process AGAIN.   Nope,  can't help me.   I guess knowing a customer out there who might not be able to contact loved ones in a deadly weather emergency is A OK morally.At this point,  I'm just curious if my phones are paid off,  because this isn't ok. Im suspended at this point, so I'm using my works wifi to use the chat feature.  Rep 5, after explaining the entire process with updates has to START THE ENTIRE PROCESS OVER.   Gets me to sign a paper to get approved for something (i think just to allow me to pay the entire bill on oct 11).  Talks me they will update me, but it'll take a few hours.   This was 12pm.  By 4pm still hadn't heard anything,  so started a chat with a rep 6 who HAS TO START THE PROCESS OVER and informs me that my letter was rejected (wasn't informed at all) and after a pissed off conversation,  I'm approved to pay 50$ on Friday, the suspension free is waived (60$) and i could make an arrangement for the rest.Final day 9/26:  I get paid early,  i start up a chat to pay the 50$ that I was promised abs told to pay.AND I HAVE TO START THE PROCESS OVER.I now am expected to pay the past due amount (not the 50$). And ""chat"" rep says they're ""limited"" in what they can do.   I literally show her screenshots of what was promised.Now they tell me to wait 24 hours for approval.  I cussed her out.I end up calling the 611 number and start the process for the 8th time.   I no longer have to 50$, i no longer have the 60$ service fee taken off and the ""computer"" can't even help me with the arragement (the dates aren't what I said I can do).Is some of this my fault? ABSOLUTELY.My issue is the lack of detail note taking that assists with helping reps deal with customers who have been speaking to several people.My issue is the lack of transparency when one rep says something can be done and it can't be done by another one.My issue is the lack of flexibility that reps used to have to assist customers whose lives just got slammed with too much stuff at once.Asking your customers to beg friends and family for money is not ok.  That customer may not have a friend or family.   There are people without support systems.Leaving your reps as shark bait for upset customers is a really crappy thing to do to employees.An inflexible computer system that doesn't leave any places for reps to assist with customer service leads to irate customers.After this experience I felt unseen,  not listened to,  and unimportant.That's why I'm leaving.",0
This company has gotten to be the most scandalous company I have ever seen they are liars and they are thieves and beware beware people don't do not do business with them unless it's prepaid and then even then I would be cautious!I went on their chat to see about possibly getting a data Sim only which would be about 10 bucks a month I signed up for it next thing you know they charge my account for $75 and they had five lines added on to this without my knowledge they dropped the letter out of my email so that I wouldn't be notified and they hid this from me for days finally one of the representatives actually said I'm going to tell you the truth you have five lines on your account! I went through hell and high water they didn't want to give me the money back the $75 they took out of my bank account they told me they would refund it for all the hassle they never did I had to shut everything down completely and now they're telling me I have to wait 45 days for my money back this is a scam people they're holding it so they can build interest off of it this is a feeding Lion Company who uses global employees you don't want to deal with global employees they're the worst! I am terminally ill with cancer and I don't have time for this and I've had to call two or three times a day every day since the 28th of September to try to get this stuff straightened out it's been nothing but a sheer nightmare I'm getting a lawyer and I'm also going to turn them into the Ada American Disability Association I'm a vulnerable adult and that is abuse and it's finest.,0
"T-Mobile is not allowed to take and sell your personal information as a telephone service provider.  So T-Mobile invented T-Mobile Tuesdays (a “gift” lottery) to enable them to take and sell your personal data, and they created various means to force/trick you into signing up whether or not you want to.The trap that I fell into (and plainly am not the first) is that if one signs up for T-Mobile Home Internet service, the only way to configure the T-Mobile router/modem in one’s home (e.g., to choose a name and password for your WiFi) is to use a specific T-Mobile app on one’s phone, and one cannot sign into the T-Mobile app without signing up for T-Mobile Tuesdays.  The T-Mobile Tuesdays terms and conditions are a near complete surrender of all of your rights, specifically including the rights to your personal data including your location data.So, T-Mobile is selling an over-the-air carrier service (presumably under an FCC tariff) that is crippled at the user end unless the user agrees to an unbelievably onerous set of terms and conditions that, among other things, allows the disclosure of your personal information.If one thinks that I am kidding about how onerous the terms and conditions are, here are a few quotes (available online on the T-Mobile Tuesdays T&Cs page):“… this contract includes indemnities to the Sponsor from you, a limitation of your rights and remedies, binding arbitration of claims, waiver of class action claims and waiver to the right to trial by jury.”  For those not familiar, “indemnities” is where you agree to be responsible for the problems of T-Mobile Tuesdays – you have to take care of the billion-dollar corporation.“By entering the Sweepstakes, Participants unconditionally: […]  b. grant (and agree to confirm that grant in writing) Sponsor, the Prize Partner and each of their respective designees to use Prize Winner’s name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed (including, but not limited to publishing the Prize Winner’s name on Sponsor’s and the Prize Partner’s Instagram and/or Facebook pages), in perpetuity, without further compensation, except in Tennessee and where prohibited by law; and c. agree that Participant’s wireless service provider may release any Participant’s phone number(s) to the Sponsor or its designees for use in contacting Participant and determining Participant’s eligibility to receive the prize.”“To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, by entering, each Participant (and guest, if applicable) and each of their agents, assignees, executors and successors agree to indemnify, defend, hold harmless and fully release and forever discharge each of the Released Parties and their respective shareholders from and against any and all liabilities, costs, claims, alleged claims, demands, duties, rights, agreements, promises, damages, injuries, losses, expenses, liens and debt actions of any kind, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, whether now known or unknown, unforeseen or foreseen, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, participation in the Sweepstakes, including without limitation, personal injury or death, loss of enjoyment, or other harm or loss of any nature whatsoever caused or contributed to by or arising out of participation in this Sweepstakes or resulting from acceptance, possession, quality, use or misuse of a prize. The Released Parties are not responsible for any additional expenses, omissions or delays resulting from any acts of any government or authority.”  Yep, you get to the pay the attorney fees for these big corporations to defend themselves against any wrongdoing, including a wrong done to you!But hey, at least then you can pick a WiFi name and password for your T-Mobile Home internet.  Congratulations!",0
"Stay away from this company!! their service is horrible, they lie and are untrustworthy! after me and my wife paid our devices off (with account up to date) and being a customer over a year, they would not unlock our devices after couple attempts and speaking to different customer service (after they initially said they would but needed to wait first was 48 hr then 72 hr then more excuses after that), there was always an excuse. and giving us the run around about this, then asking why we need our phones unlocked? all to keep stealing from you! all this does is frustrate the customer and making them want to leave even more! they need to do better, but I am done dealing with them! do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
Had problem with phone got no help they told me I had to go to repair shop I could not get hardly any call's   I will not recommend them to anybody.went to them many times never got help,0
"Some how it is hard to say that is there a worse cell phone provider than Straight Talk. T-Mobile has made the bottom of the list of all cell service providers. Reps make many excuses and try to make the company rules work for them and thrown the customer under the bus. Corporate stores vs authorized dealers are so different that they do not align with corporate. The sales rep at Walmart was a complete liar and tells you what she wants to gain a sale. I have been dealing with these none working phones for 4 months. Billing issues for 3 months of over charges, cause the Walmart rep did not set it up correctly, Then phone reps promising that it has been fixed. Three months later still automatic drafts with over charges. So I am out of town and T-Mobile overcharged me and I was not able to get a hotel room for the night ( I was out on business), so my wife and I had to sleep at the grocery store parking lot. I address the concern with T-Mobile and they did not care. My phones from day one had not worked properly since day one. I called and had many promises to repair, call backs and neither had been done. The last rep/supervisor over looked that I said day one and said that I had 30 days to take the phones back but placed it on the authorized dealer when I had been calling in. Everything there after then revolved against the 30 day return policy. Therefore no resolution, tried escalating and he says he is as high as I can escalate other than writing a letter my mail. So how does it take 4 months with no resolution from a company like T-Mobile. We made the move to get away from Straight Talk bad customer service and T-Mobile ended up being the worst! So my recommendation is do not buy from an authorized dealer, they have the bottom end of the products and they do not align to T-Mobile. If there is no stock do not get into the contract as it will mess everything up. Read everything cause T-Mobile does not  care about you once they think they have you locked in. I have asked for escalation or call from corporate and was told nobody will call us back. So it really looks like I am searching another carrier.",0
"Business account with Sprint & then T-Mobile for over 15 years. Staff member lost phone, called to replace & spent an hour with someone who obviously didn't know what they were doing. I had to pay taxes with a credit card ($95), okay fine & staff should get the phone next day or two. Received 2 emails from T-Mobile days later confirming the 2 orders & wrong shipping address on both. Noticed too they charged my card twice for the $95. Called the next day trying to get them to reverse the double charge & cancel the duplicated order. They did not help & ended up getting disconnected. Called back & found out BOTH phones were shipping to my office in another state from where the phone was supposed to go. They ended up having to place an entire new order & this time I paid $48 in taxes??? Well 2 phones showed up at the office this morning & we refused shipment as we were told to...now let's see how long it takes to get the account straightened up. By the way the reason they checked for the returns was ""buyers remose"", I objected & said hope there's a box to check for T-Mobile mess up. Will definitely be looking for another provider.",0
"I transferred devices from one account to another in 2023. Multiple times I contact t mobile because the devices were not transferred. I was told they would take care of it. They never did. They sent me to collections for those devices, even after they verified I contacted them about the issue. I spoke with the store manager and other store employee's with no resolution. I have been trying to get this taken out of collections and off my credit due to their error and they refuse. I have no problem paying off the devices, I just want it off my credit and the payment plan for the devices honored. The only valid reason I can come up with is the fact a family member who worked there was sexually harassed, was physically assaulted, and received multiple death threats from staff at the Yreka, Ca store, so as a punishment to my family for having the manager and other 2 employee's involved terminated for this behavior.",0
"T-mobile deserves zero stars. This is a very expensive service that cannot back up the high prices with not even mediocre service. I consistently had a single bar, the spinning wheel of death, a minimum of 40 minutes wait time and up to 4.5 hours on hold with customer service. The promise to buy your phone is ONLY on paper. You actually get nothing for a trade in. I was also promised $150 in Sam’s club gift cards. I never saw them. I had to pay $700 to purchase my phone so I could get a better carrier for more than 1/2 the cost and far superior service. AVOID TMOBILE!!!!",0
"Have a Business account with T-Mobile and have had excellent payment history for over a year. Nothing financed on my account. Was trading in me and my partners phone for a $1,000 credit per phone. New phones cost $1,200. They still want a $450 Down payment per phone even though that would make it $500 more then the total purchase and they will “ Pay it back “ over 24 months in bill credits. So I’m giving them a $500 interest free loan that they take 2 Years to pay back? Probably taking my business to another carrier. This is ridiculous and makes no mathematical sense. Think 2ce before switching to t-mobile.",0
"I am beyond frustrated with T-Mobile right now. I have been a loyal customer for nearly 22 years. In fact, T-Mobile is the only cell phone provider I have ever been with, and I have sung your praises since I was 16 years old. For the first time, I am so upset over your processes and failed promises, I am ready to take my 5+ lines of service elsewhere. Not only am I considering leaving T-Mobile, but I am prepared to tell every and any one who will listen about my horrendous experience. While that may not mean much to you, word of mouth travels quickly - especially if I go to the media, (which they may or may not care to cover, but I will literally not stop until I'm heard).I have been trying to access my OWN PERSONAL phone records from November of 2022. After much run-around from representatives stating it wasn't possible, I finally spoke with someone from one of your physical locations who not only informed me it is possible, but he also told me how to get them. I wish I could remember his name because I was very grateful for his willingness to help. Per his instructions, I called, ""611,"" and asked for a reprint. Sure enough, that seemed to be all I needed at the time. I was assured I would receive my reprint in the mail within 10 business days.10 business days came and went, and I never received my statement. I called again, and a representative by the name of Angel, was very empathetic. He ordered a 2nd reprint for me, and he even offered to follow up with me within a week to ensure I received them. The week went by, and Angel called as he promised (super grateful for that), but I still hadn't received my reprint. He then told me he would request a manager to upload them and email them to me. He said it might take 24 hrs as they were really busy.I gave them 48 hours to get the job done, and yet nothing happened AGAIN. I called ""611"" that evening, and I reached a different representative who said they would send another request for management to email my records to me. She said she would call me back the following day at 10:00 AM while a manager was present to ensure it happened. Guess who never received a follow up call...That evening, after work, I called into the ""611"" line, and I explained the situation once more. I was assured yet another empty promise that I would have my November 2022 statement in my email within 24 hours. Do I have my phone records yet? No. No, I do not.Never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think that it would be so difficult to request my own personal phone records. DO BETTER, T-Mobile; do better!",0
"I switch to t-mobile 4 phone line and 2 warless internet. the worse customer service they never respond, well yes but only if you a new customer after that no respond I was waiting on hold almost and hour in to different times big mistake to switch to T-mobile",0
"I have had t mobile for over 2 years now because I was stuck in a plan with my sister. Over the last year I've realized how terrible they're service really is. I can't even make calls at my own house without the WIFI. On top of that, every time I try to contact customer service It's super sketchy and I never actually get solutions. I am quitting today because I haven't had service for over a week and I've talked to three different people about the situation all gave me the same resolution. It would work for about an hour and then my service would be blocked again. I have never been as upset at any company as much as I am with T Mobile. All they do is take your money and cause issues. You would have better luck buying minutes than with this company. Absolutely horrible.",0
"After 2 days sim card doesn't work, the customer service is useless, it, a a falraud, don't buy it!",0
"I paid for insurance on my two phone lines. Been with the company 32 years. Cracked my screen, went to the T mobile store on Ann Arbor rd in Plymouth  mi, and was refused any kind of assistance or re -imbursment for my damaged phone. The screen repair was supposed to be covered with a co-pay. They said no, gave me a card for a generic repair place 20 minutes away. 300 dollars later I had a new screen. Don't get suckered into paying for something that they will not honor. Don't get the protection plan. I'm sorry I did.",0
"They would get a 0 if I could. We shut service down for many of the same reasons you see here. We received a bill -$45.00 so the owed me, but instead continued to charge my card. When contacted they said we owed them some $125.00 then sent me to a collection agency when I stopped payment on my card. Now I get another bill -$45.00 yet won't give it back.",0
Their service has gotten really bad lately and I’ve had to keep switching off of their 5G back to LTE back to 5G back to LTE. Turning my phone off and on to regain a cell tower.  My phone loses coverage in areas where it never used to in the metro and suburban areas,0
"If you are a tourist avoid the prepaid t-mobile. The coverage was so poor on the west coast that after a week of use I went back to a store to find out what was wrong. It was the worst wifi prepaid I have experienced in 11 countries. I was told it was unlimited data for US$65 a month, but it seems the prepaid speed is slowed when t-mobile plan users are on the network (they get priority), and it is not unlimited. At 50G you get a message to say you still have unlimited data, but it slows to unusable speeds. Misleading sales and terr",0
"This place has stolen  well over $250.08 from me and has been caught in many lies by me and my bank, as they were called on a 3way call and I have a copy of each transaction  that tmobile usa inc wants to lie about  and completely refuses to fix my account  abd hold the person  accountable.",0
"I was talked into signing the 5G next plan ($180/mo) to get 2 new phones and and several rebates.It turns out $300 of that rebate was no long valid at the time T-Mobile offered me the rebate, and their customer service rep even applied the rebates for me. After 4 months, I check the status of the rebates and they were denied since, again those rebates were dated.T-Mobile is only willing to make up 50% of my loss on rebate.I cannot trust their sales person or the customer service rep that applied the rebates for me. I will be switching services.",0
T-Mobile is terrible customer service is garbage the actual service is not what they say it is I can have 5G 3 bars and it still slow internet customer service is completely unhelpful they don't care about helping you at all go in to the store and its like they don't even know what they are talking about they will lie to you about everything,0
Bad coverage. The last few weeks  I’ve had to alternate between LTE and 5G because their service is overloaded and they can’t provide on the 5G as promised.,0
"Awful company! I haven't used their services for 2 months and they still requested me to pay $200. When I called customer service, I asked multiple times if I would be charged more and was told no. Guess what? I received yet another bill with $24.95 to pay. Called customer service again and they requested PIN (which I paid $20 for and don't have anymore since my account has been cancelled). For not having this pin the charges can't be removed. Online help refused to help me too. Worst mobile company ever. Switching to Mint and will never look back.",0
"They can do whatever they want and get away with it because they have a monopoly on cell towers. That's also why they aren't incentivized to provide quality service to their customer. It's a horrible company and anytime that you have to contact them for any issue, it's like torture. Longest phone calls ever, most inept service ever and everything is ridiculously expensive.",0
"I switched to T Mobile in April, 2024. During the switch, the rep offered me a “free” tablet to accompany the tablet line for my granddaughter. Unfortunately, neither the phones nor the tablet ever had service at my house. After over 2 months of no service at my house, I cancelled and switched back to Verizon. Of course, upon cancellation, the tablet was suddenly no longer free and not returnable. So, I paid the balance and was assured by the rep that it would be unlocked and available to use on any other network. I took him at his word but did not attempt to use the tablet until the end of August. That is when I discovered that it was still locked to T Mobile. I have spoken to MANY different techs and even went back to the original store in an effort to get the thing unlocked. Now, T Mobile is telling me that it is unlocked (it’s not) and refuses to help anymore. I spent several hundred dollars on a device that I couldn’t use (it’s still locked because it was only on their network for several days and was on WI-FI the rest of the time) and still can’t use because I couldn’t use it on their network due to having no service at my house. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM!!",0
I am disappointed in T-Mobile now. They charge $10 to pay a bill AND you have to agree to all the terms & conditions before you can use the app. So I am deleting the app since I don't agree to 3rd parties having my info. I will be switching from T-Mobile elsewhere. They also use 5G that's harmful to our bodies and children's bodies!,0
"Response to request of contact.The team member was very professional and understanding.I apologize for my demeanor.T-Mobile wi fi service is a disgrace !!MORE THAN ONCE MY DEVICES HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET.I HAVE SPENT HOURS ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES.USUALLY ON THE VERGE OF CONTACTING A TECHINICIAN OR REPAIR PERSON.I RECENTLY LOOKED AT THE T-MOBILE TRANSMITTER AND DISCOVERED THAT THE DEVICES WERE NOT ACTIVE ON THE TRANSMITTER.APPARENTLY, THE TRANSMITTER DISCONNECTS DEVICES RANDOMLY.FURTHER, WHEN WATCHING A STREAMING SERVICE THE SIGNAL IS WEAK.AFTER REBOOTING THE SIGNAL GOES TO EXCELLENT FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN RETURNS TO FAIR.THE PROGRAM/SPORTS EVENT IS CONSTANTLY INTERUPTED AS THE SIGNAL ALTERNATES.NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.I WILL START EVALUATING MY INTERNET PROVIDER OPTIONS TODAY. ( 9-12-2024 )FURTHER, MY DECEASED WIFE`S ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED ABRUPYLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF THREE PHONE NUMBERS, CONTACT DATA, ETC.T-MOBILE IS NOT A GOOD SERVICE PROVIDER !!!!",0
Bought a plan for my elderly dad. It never even worked! I tried to cancel but the only way to do it was to travel to the nursing home where my dad was and have a pin sent. Even when calling on the phone! They accept nothing but a pin sent to the phone. They sent me to collections when you can clearly see the phone had never been used. AWFUL customer service,0
"I went with T-Mobile over 20 years ago, back when their signal was crappy at best and everybody had Verizon. I loyally hung in there, now they have grown and have a good signal.  My issue is, after all these years, I CAN NOT get a free phone if my life depended on it. I have tried MANY times, spent hours on the phone with them. I see all these free phone offers for new customers, but not for me. I'd have to change my plan to a much more expensive one AND trade my phones, ( I have 4 lines). Amazingly none of my phones qualify for trade either. (go figure, they're old). I have the plan I can afford and will not change my plan to get free phones. I believe T-Mobiles goal is to get me to switch to a expensive plan so I can get a new phone, they are playing dirty. I am looking at other carriers now, they may be more but they'll give you a new phone, so it evens out. 24 years with them and that's my reward??? Shame on them!Thanks for NOTHING!!Go somewhere else for your service, because once you're their customer they treat you like crap and take you for granted.",0
"A Deeply Disappointing Experience with T-Mobile’s Services.I had specifically requested to block both roaming and international calls on my account due to previous concerns about T-Mobile’s practices. After confirming multiple times with customer support that these services were blocked, I still received charges for roaming. When I called to resolve the issue, I spent an agonizing 47 minutes with a representative who ultimately informed me that the block hadn't been applied correctly to individual accounts. This level of negligence is completely unacceptable.T-Mobile’s support and service have proven to be unreliable and misleading. As a customer, I feel scammed by their inability to deliver on basic requests. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have encountered.",0
"I am an 11 year customer with multiple lines on my account. My wife and daughter upgraded their phones t-mobile sent 2 iPhone Pro phones when we had ordered the iPhone Pro Max. Upon contacting you, you sent a return label and we shipped the unopened boxes back to t-mobile. We were told once the shipped phones are received by the warehouse the new phones will be shipped out. The tracking number shows that you (the warehouse) received the iPhone Pro phones, shortly after we received the iPhone Pro Max phones. My account has still not been updated to show that the phones have been received in the warehouse.I’ve called T-Mobile customer service five times with each representative, claiming that they’re going to see this through and call me back. So far none of the reps or supervisors have resolved this issue. My last call I’ve escalated to second-level management promising to get me video surveillance showing when UPS dropped off the phones, and paper trail in the wearhouse to track what happened with the package and where it is now.. I received an email stating that they can’t help me with this matter and the phones can’t be found, therefore no refund will be issued.I’ve read through multiple threads on the internet, this appears to be an ongoing problem with this multi billion dollar company scamming and taking advantage of their customers. I am currently being charged over $2000.00 for Phones that I sent back to them and are not in my possession.T-Mobile is giving me many conflicting answers, some reps have said the phones have been received and it’s has not been scanned in, some are telling me the boxes were empty although they confirmed the weight of the packages indicate the phones would be in the box, and some reps are telling me that the package is nowhere to be found. We went to UPS and they confirmed delivery has been made. I have filed complaints with FCC, Department of Consumer Affairs and have reached out to multiple media agencies to get this issue on the media. I need resaloution but no one in your company seems to care.",0

"So a representative changed my due date with out my authorization and caused a short bill to be generated for 79 dollars, from this they added it to my normal bill of 200 dollars and are now saying I owe $279.

"My family and I have used T-Mobile for close 10 years and other than the price of the plans, the company wasn't that bad but then again what choice do you have? When my husband and I separated I chose to change phone plans to separate our phone bill. We have been trying to get T-Mobile to unlock the phone for over three weeks now and we still cannot use OUR phones with the new company. Mind you, our phones are completely paid for. I have called multiple times and spent several hours of my time arguing with customer service and nothing has helped resolve the issue. I requested to speak to a manager and they told me that they would say the same thing. It has left me no choice but to leave reviews. Our phones were $1,200 a piece and now they are paperweights. I am so done with phone companies thinking they can screw us over.",0
"If I could give negative 5 stars, I would. They are terrible. Run, run, run!!! I called to order home internet. The guy on the phone convinced me to transfer my cell coverage to T mobile. I decided to transfer my cell coverage. But, I changed my mind after reading reviews. Before I received the SIM cards for my phones, I called to cancel the phones. But...I have been charged month after month for these phones. What a total nightmare! Run, Run Run!!",0
From the beginning I was offered one thing and received nothing.... but a bill.... horrible customer service horrible everything and service isn't that great.....,0

"I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile.  In general, the service has been very good, however, I've encountered two major issues that are unacceptable.First, when I bought an iPhone and Android, I specified that I wanted insurance on both.  When I lost the Android, I contacted T-Mobile and was told that the iPhone was covered but the Android was not.  T-Mobile would not honor the commitment the local store made re. the Android being covered.At the time I purchased the two phones, the salesperson convinced me that I would benefit from having trackers.  I made it clear that I traveled extensively internationally, and would need to track my luggage internationally.  I've taken several trips trying to use the trackers but they did not work.  Today, T-Mobile stated that my trackers would work only domestically, and that only businesses could subscribe to the international service  So, I've been paying monthly charges for these trackers that do not work as advertised.I never encountered this type of misrepresentation from Verizon, and am seriously considering going back to them.",0
We ordered two sync up devices and T-Mobile will not activate the devices without us having to travel to a store and verify who we are.  Spend the extra money and go with Verizon or AT&T.,0
"I have been with tmobile for 12 years and I trusted the internet service, DONT GET IT, IT DOESNT WORK AND AFTER YOU CALL THEM many times trying to find the reason that its not working, changing location of the modem, changing the chip, changing the modem, etc, THEY WILL CHARGE FOR FULL SERVICE. Safe time and get internet somewhere else.",0
So I get a phone call August 28th schedule appointment for September 3rd 2024 6:30 a.m. no phone call no nothing I make an inquiry via text they tell me my application was denied due to location this is a classic corporate negligence they're so desperate the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing and they could care less who they step on. I can tell you this from my experience. If this used car lot treat you like this before you even get to the interview how would you like to have your whole future depending on this scab outfit..... if you're a young technician avoid this place like the plague I'm in his trade 30 years this is a scab outfit,0
"TMobile Home internet service is simply Horrific.  The last time I experienced internet this awful was when internet first became a thing.  The Buffering, Freezing and weak to no signal when it rains MEANS JUST GIVE UP.  There is no savings when you are paying for frustration.  No matter how many times I contacted TMobile to complain about these issues, none of their fixes, or suggestions were a remedy.  I ended up tolerating this bad service for six months, at which point I could adequately afford to change providers.  The worst part is; I cancelled my service on 9/02/24 and was told I would still be billed for the whole month of September because my bill closing date was 25 days away.  Then I was told that I would also be responsible for a final bill in October.  TMobile should have been paying me for all the times I called for support, because the service was randomly available .and at a level where it was useful to all members of the family",0
"About a year ago I went to do a trade in for an iPhone 14 Pro. I traded in my Note 10 plus and got the trade in “promotion” of $850 and the credit would be applied monthly in the bills. They said that all was done and I got the phone. First month and credit didn’t show. So I went to back at the same store and they told me it would “take some time to show up”. OK, I wait another month and paid my bill again with no credit shown. So I went back to the store and they told me that customer service would have to investigate why. They then told me again to wait until customer service contacts them back. This time I waited 2 months and went back to the same store. They said they need more time. At this point I waited a year and I decided to investigate my self. I personally called customer service and they said they would investigate and see why the “credit” didn’t go thru. I then waited another 6 days I was told that the device was “damaged” when it arrived at the warehouse. How can it be “damaged” if in the store it was tested and seen by an associated. I don’t know if they are just trying to cover their tracks and get out of this problem but it was not handled well. I ended up giving up my almost brand new note  10 plus for free and paying full price for the iPhone.",0

"Zero stars if permitted by Trustpilot. I had been with T-Mobile when it was a very good cellular service provider. Since the gotcha notification of the price increase a few months ago, T-Mobile service has plummeted. They are now as bad or worse than AT&T, Comcast, Zoom and the long list of corporations with dismal reputations for customer care. Long hold times to reach a T-Mobile support agent are now standard operating procedure. As I am writing this review I have been on hold for over 1 hour and 24 minutes to reach a tech support agent. This is unacceptable. No one from T-Mobile is attempting to remedy the long hold times. Anyone who selects T-Mobile as their cellular phone service provider should be examined for neurological damage.",0
"I don't usually leave reviews (I will try to post this on other sites as well).Our family totally regrets switching to T-Mobile.It is clear that their mission is wear you down, confuse you, and leave you feeling angry and confused.DO NOT fall for the ""Keep and Switch"" promotion. It is a total scam. The website for the rebate submission doesn't work. The email address they told me to use bounced back ""email full"". The countless hours of phone calls and re-explaining the situation is insane.I feel like a total loser for getting involved with this company.I hope this review helps someone make a better decision than we did.",0
The WORST!!!!!  They lie telling you they will fix any discrepancies on your bill just to turn around and fix it.  They sneak in charges every month and they bolt face steal from their customers!!!  GO ANYWHERE ELSE,0
How are they able to change my phone number and my password to my T-Mobile app without consent. It is beyond me. Then want to charge me to switch it back. I have a terminal illness this was the cherry on top I'm headed to hospital.,0
"I have been a customer for 16 years and am appalled at the lack of response and service I have experienced with T-mobile. I was due to receive a return call on Thursday 8/29 regarding an escalation or investigation on my account. When T Mobile merged with sprint I continued to be charged for a device leased with sprint on 7/21. That lease agreement was for an 18 month period. My account continued to be charged 45 dollars unbeknownst to me for a device that was paid off. In dealing with another issue I saw the charge on my account and spoke to customer care. The total amount of charges post the end of my lease is estimated in the amount of 900$. I was informed T mobile could issue me a three month credit only. I requested that the three month credit be issued immediately. In addition to my request for a full refund credit to be escalated to corporate and investigated. I was reassured I would receive a call back on Thursday from Monique regarding details of that investigation. I never agreed nor signed any agreement whatsoever nor did I receive any notification that I would be billed for a leased device post the 18 month period. No one has returned my call nor was I issued an immediate 3 month credit as promised. I am again asking this matter be escalated. T-mobile makes billions of dollars in revenue from its customers. If this issue is not resolved promptly I will be seeking consultation from an attorney to look into whether or not T mobile is stealing money from its customers and refusing to return calls or refund monies that are owed to its customers. I am asking that my complaint is further escalated and forwarded to the appropriate administration. Not a customer care representative with limited experience, capability, or scope to handle this concern. Please review the last call that was recorded and noted on my account. I am requesting a return call from someone in administration as soon as possible. I am also requesting my account is credited immediately as promised. Thank you.",0
I have been extremely disappointed with this service. I was told I qualified for certain phones. And just to pick them up from the store.  The store said I didn't qualify and I ended up with crappy phones that get hot. Then I get my first bill for 47.00. The second bill went to 470. 00. Then when I could not pay that they added a 200 disconnect fees on it. Despite me calling and making arrangements and being told that I would be fine. Oh did I mention that on my bill there were like 7 lines and services that I never asked for or received. Still didn't take those off or the reconnect fees or the late fees. Then they had it setup on days that I didn't get paid on. Then when I call and try and explain to them why I am unhappy they never resolve anything. I was with atnt for years. My bill was the same 75 a month. With tmobil I get 3 bills a month. And I could continue for ever. Worst service ever. They even charge u for customer service. Wow. Unbelievable.,0
"I was going to leave my current internet and cell phone provider and start both services with T-Mobile. However, when I called my existing provider to cancel they gave me better rates, so I decided to stay with them and called T-Mobile to cancel my intended switch well before the intended switch date, so neither service was ever set up at all. So I thought all is settled. However, I received a letter from a debt collector for unpaid T-Mobile bill.  Up until then I had not even received a bill from T-Mobile – that came later, even after I called T-Mobile to complain and they told me all is good.  I called the again. I was told all is well again “since you never even started the services and we see that.”  Comes another bill. I call them again. The rep says he is going to refer this to their fraud department.  Idk what logic that makes, but that’s supposedly to try to put a stop to this madness. Some days go by and I get a letter from another debt collector. This is where we are today.  This T-Mobile in my judgment is a mad house!!! I will steer away from them like a plague. Now I have to AGAIN spend a lot of time placing more calls… or I might consult an attorney.I call the debt collector. Told them the events above and how I then owe nothing.  He tried to tell me the service begins when I receive SIM cards even if the actual service has not been started. I told him that’s bs. Then I called T-Mobile. Explained all again to the rep. She consulted her supervisors, whoever, and upon returning said there is nothing she can do because it has been submitted to debt collector. The rep was nice and sympathized with my situation. She didn’t think I should be charged for services never rendered. I may have to get an attorney if this nonsense doesn’t stop.",0
"I signed up for the FREE TRIAL via t mobil. I received the equipment and was able to get the price down at my current carrier. I called t mobil and was directed to return the equipment to my local store,which I did. I was directed by the agent in the store to call and cancel to save myself a bill. I called and was reassured I would get no bill amd they would back date the bill to protect me from getting billed. This was on August 15th 2024. Today, August 30 2024,I received a bill for $56!!!! I called again....Another non-e glish speaking chart reader that couldn't and wouldn't help me. Just kept repeating the same thing and trying to ask for the same info!! After 10 min I was so angry and asked for a supervisor. After another 15 mon hold I finally hung up!!! This company is bogus!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM IN ANY WAY!!!",0
"Couldn't even use the data for 3 months. Can't make calls while on the road. Luckily I have wifi at work and home.Asked Tmobile tech for help still couldn't figure it out.He suggested I just upgrade to a free phone.  Ok, sounds good. But Tmobile wouldn't take the phone unless I replace the tiny crack on the screen ($120).Decided to switch to Verizon. Gave me three new phones with much better reliability. I guess Tmobile would rather nickel and dime their existing customers and lose a customer after 7 years. What kind of stupid business model is that?Personel at Verizon stores always look more professional and busy compare to Tmobile stores. Hmmm",0
I've had the worst experience with tmobile. I canceled my internet almost a year ago. They never stopped billing me. I also had a watch I bought. Was supposed to have it's own line. When I went to far from my phone it would say I'm to far for Bluetooth. When I took it to the store they said that It does not have its own line and that the phone number was just to keep track of making payments on the devise it self. Now 2 years later they say it was supposed to have service and over charged me $15 per month. So I totally I was over charged $785. Not to mention when I told them I did not want insurance on any of my phones come to find out they charged me for years 15 dollars a month per line. I refuse to pay the bill they say is $460. They owe me $750. I said I'm willing to cancel what I owe you and get my plan corrected. Keep the extra $350. They said that they can get it so I only owe $270. Thrn said i should have known about it. They will only do $100 credit. I have been telling them for months.  Not happening. I'm done with this company.,0
"Drove to store on Rt 83 in Round Lake Beach ILWent to cancel my brother's phone in my family account w T-Mobile, since he passed away.Employee at Round Lake Beach store said I should do it over phone. I explained I already spoke w someone on phone, and didn't want to do it by phone.He continued to instruct me to do it by phone. Finally i had enough and left. Second time this location can't help me.Drove 20 minutes to another TMobile locationin Antioch and they were able to help me with no questions askedClose down the store in Round Lake Beach. They never seem helpful in any way and this is a national issue with many companies and I'm not accepting it any moreEither perform customer service for the high prices or close.I've been with sprint and t mobile for 20+ years.Very very disgusted.",0
"One star because you can give zero.  Switch to T-Mobile about 6 months ago after about 20 years with Verizon.  I was lied to from the beginning, their support people do not know how a cell phone works, if you want to escalate you have to WRITE to them.  They are a technology company and you have to WRITE to them?!?!? On paper?!?!?",0
"To be the worst ever you must really try. I have over the years had Us Cellular, Verizon, Att. US Cellular was good. In June I wanted to try TMobile  as my present carrier ATT has gone to very poor service at my home due to a tower issue and Att is not going to repair. I had TMobile service for less than 12 hours. My fist issue showed me that their Customer Care is more like Customer We Don’t Care so I cancelled everything the same day as it was set up. I was told I owed zero as I had made zero calls, zero texts, and zero internet. For the 3rd month in a row a bill for $2.67 comes. 1 hour on phone STILL UNRESOLVED. Run away from this company.",0
T-Mobile is terrible. You’re bill will never be the same and will definitely never go lower it’s always some bullcrao and talking to them is like talking to a wall,0
"I don’t understand why there’s no oversight for companies like this.Literally thousands of poor reviews, BBB,this platform,Google etc.all w/same  theme,billing issues,generally poor connectivity & poor customer service &  , God forbid you want out…you’re punished w/continued auto debit or bills.Reputable companies don’t try to make you stay.",0
"Bad service. Calls randomly end on my Galaxy S24 ultra and previously owned phones (Galaxy A54, One Plus Nord N 30). I've called Samsung and T Mobile too many times do the same troubleshooting steps over and over but still didn't fix the issue. It can't be the phone because it has happened on more than one of my devices",0
"I am deeply disappointed with the level of customer service I received from T-Mobile. During my recent interaction, the representatives I spoke with were shockingly unknowledgeable and unprofessional. I called with a relatively simple issue, but instead of providing clear answers, the rep seemed confused and had no idea how to address my concerns.When I asked for clarification, I was met with vague responses and several "" i cant do that."" It became clear that this representative lacked even basic knowledge about the services and products T-Mobile offers. To make matters worse, their attitude was indifferent and dismissive, making me feel like my issue wasn’t important to them at all.After spending over 45 minutes on the phone without a resolution, I was left frustrated and no closer to solving my problem. It’s shocking that a company as large as T-Mobile would allow such untrained and unprofessional representatives to interact with customers. This experience has seriously made me reconsider continuing with their service.T-Mobile, if you want to keep your customers, you need to invest in better training and hire people who actually care about providing help. This experience was unacceptable.",0
"A tmobile store ""gave"" me a ""free"" phone when I renewed a contract.  The tmobile store illegally signed me up for a new line, which is why  the phone was free.  When I cancelled the illegally added line, I had to pay $500 for the phone.  Now the phone can not even be unlocked even though it is paid for and my account is in good standing (for 14 years).  Time to make a FTC complaint and get a new carrier. I have spent over 10 hours talking to support and supervisor's in at least 10 different calls, the latest (and last) being today.  They are truly incompetent.",0
"Used my TMobile iphone on a densely populated street in a U.S. city called Chicago. A metropolitan area of 8,984,000. At 6:29 pm CDT on 8/26/2024, received the following text from TMobile customer service:""We hope that you are enjoying your plan benefits! Your usage has been roaming off our network, which violates our terms and conditions. If this line ( ) continues to roam extensively over the next month, your line will be canceled.""Called TMobile customer service to ensure it wasn't spam. It wasn't. I was advised to get a Tmobile coverage map to avoid this heinous error in the future. Yes, I am to memorize the Tmobile coverage map at all times, street-by-street, in the center of the 3rd largest city in the USA. Assumed that, because TMobile has 77 stores in a city of this size,this carrier would have full coverage. Bad customer that I am, I was wrong. I learned that I need to memorize the TMobile coverage map in Chicago. And most everywhere that I use the phone. I have learned the hard way, after 18 months of timely payments totaling $1566, I learned what an awful customer I am. One more incident like this and TMobile will terminate my line. I only wish I could attach a copy of the above text from TMobile to share with the world. If TMobile wonders the identity of the evil customer who posted this review, then I suggest that they check texts they sent at 6:29 pm CDT on Monday, August 26, 2024. Oh, and I then learnt that the ""roaming zone"" in question was within TMobile's prime 5G area.",0
"I was with T-mobile for very long time. Even when they whitelisted my phone for being too old. When I got tired of spending money on a phone that only allowed me to use it like an old dial phone, I decided to switch to another carrier. Here's a tip, don't tell them you are switching until you have switched, otherwise they will turn off your phone, where you got all of your access codes to your T-mobile account, apple account, work accounts, etc., and then they will cancel your account before you can get your correct account number, which by the way cannot be found in your account. After nearly 10 years with them they rewarded me with aggravation and contempt. Let the phone subscriber beware!! T-Mobile sucks!!!",0
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR T MOBILE!  Bait and Switch.  The hours and hours on horrible customer service to get no where.  Promised service at $35 per line.  Credit for trade in.  Now $55 per line, they have my phone and nothing I can do.  Will not honor $35 even with recorded call stating $35.STAY FAR AWAY!",0
Why customers got to pay extra 5 dollars to make. Payment in store when store is empty and nothing going on and the coverage sucks half time. Makes no sense,0
The t-mobile agents are not honest they told me that the internet is 50 dollars a month but when i received it and activated the device it was 60 dollars a month and the phone services when i switched to t-mobile was awful i canceled it the same day i got it and they didnt refund me the full money i paid for they only refunded 16 dollars of the amount 43 dollars i paid for .. they were terrible in every way i will never choose t-mobile again.,0
"I left T-Mobile May 31st this year for a cheaper option. Two weeks later they billed me for the upcoming month. I called 9 time since then and still have not received a refund for their billing error. Suffice it to say, I will NEVER return to T-Mobile!",0
"The wors experience ever for a prepaid sim card. 1 They do not accept European credit cards (they just do not accept them, why? Idk). 2. Once your number got deactivated you are no longer in a position to pay for another month... In order to reactivate it, you need to log in into your T-mobile account, but it requires... receiving a text. Once the number is deactivated, you cannot receive any texts.Worst experience ever. DON'T NOT GET T-MOBILE!!!",0
"Everything was going fine with t mobile until you suggested.Changing my account to save money.  Once they did this, They broke my account into parts that I didn't even know they were billing.  Now they are asking me to pay back charges that we're in a account I wasn't even billed for.  DO NOT USE TMOBILE!",0
A representative told me to oay $150 and my services turned only to be told that I needed an extra $230. It's so low to lie to a customer to get them off the phone.,0
I would not recommend them to anyone worst company and obviously liars who are selling defective Iphone 15 to customers and refuse to send a replacement when the problem with the phones are not caused by the customers. My phone is not even a year and I have called them 6 times regarding the situation and they refused to replace because I do not have insurance. Why should I when the problem us with the product you sold. I cannot wait to get another company to buy out my remaining contract from them. They have gone down hill money and greed is what's driving them now. They no longer value their customers. Do not switch to them.,0
"T-Mobile bad news don’t buy - I phone 15 - from T- Mobile store there no good you will get a problem with the camera and- t mobile will do nothing and Apple wants to charge you $1,200.00 to fix camera rip off t mobile is bad news my phone is new yet and have insurance on phone and to replace my phone they want a lot...",0
The majority of the customer care specialists have no clue what they are doing.  They read a script.   I had to call multiple times this week trying to resolve and issue with a phone and it was HORRIBLE. I wasted hours on the phone - one rep was very helpful but the info she gave was incorrect - and led to more calls and trips to the store - then I escalated to a supervisor - only to find out after 90 minutes on the phone with him - the info he gave me wasn't accurate because he is in a different time zone - my question was - how do I know that?  Shouldn't he know that?   So they told me they were trying just to set the expectations - it ended with my reply of - no your not setting the expectations - you are telling me that once again T-Mobile is failing and not fulfilling their obligations for the 2nd time this week.   I've been with Sprint/T-mobile for 21 years and am seriously considering a change.,0
"I was a loyal customer for 18 years---18 YEARS. When I moved to my new apartment 2 months ago I could not get any reception for my phone or home internet. I contacted T-Mobile numerous times and was told since there was a hospital between me and the tower, that I would not be able to get reception. So I reluctantly had to leave T-Mobile. Then their tune changed. I kept getting billed for things, claiming I didn't return some type of hardware I supposedly got in 2015. I would call and get a different story from the representative each time The last straw was them sending me a collection notice for a bill that they had never sent me for that supposed hardware. The actual T-Mobile bill didn't show up for 4 days after the collection notice which is just wrong. I should have left T-Mobile years ago.",0
I have been a customer of Tmobile since they took over Sprint and about 10 years with Sprint.  My bill went up $20 and they told me it was because I paid my phones off.  So had I kept paying for phones it would have been less expensive. I was then told they would give me a credit for being a loyal customer for so many years and I asked if that was permanent.  They told me they would check.  I called today and the lady I spoke with was rude and condescending and said you arent going to get credit for something you arent paying for.  I told her cancel my service and hung up.  She called back and I said I have nothing left to say to you she said i cant cancel your service if you hang up.  I said well you were extremely rude have someone else call me because I dont want to talk to you. no one has called back yet.,0
"Complete junk. I will have a voicemail show up and my phone didn’t even ring. And then if it does ring, it takes forever for the voicemail to show until it transcribes it to text because T-Mobile thinks thats needed.  All of a sudden weird things happen on my phone like my navigation apps don’t know where I am. Their cellular service is junk. I have better cellular service with them with 2G coverage when I’m overseas than I do with them in the United States. I also don’t have enough reception for my apps to stay on. I click on an app and it turns off immediately.",0
My family has had T-mobile for six years and the past couple of months have really made me regret choosing them as my cell phone provider. My son’s phone was not letting him make or receive calls or text with the data service only with Wi-Fi. My husband has been to a T-mobile store and has talked to several T-mobile representatives on the phone to rectify this issue. Long story short… the phone is still not fixed but we still get a full bill every month for four phones and can only use three. If that’s not stealing I don’t know what is. Your job is to provide customers with service and satisfaction we have received neither for two months. As a parent it is vital for me to be able to contact and communicate with my child through our cell phones. This company has stressed my entire family out behind this one issue that an entire company can’t seem to resolve. I will wholeheartedly be in the market for a new and more trustworthy cell phone carrier immediately.,0
"Absolutely the worst wireless company in the country!Aside from dropped calls almost daily and messages not going through the customer service is atrocious.I have never dealt with such stupidity and ignorance and I was with Bank of America...that's saying something!They will literally lock your phone even after you've paid your bill forcing to pay again.The lies and games are truly unbelievable.It's no wonder out of every single carrier in the country they were rated the absolute worst...on a scale of 1-100 they scored a 51.I'm not surprised but so grateful to be gone and to never have to deal with their terrible ""lack of customer service"" agents ever again!",0
"I give T mobile zero stars you're on hold for over three hours. I've proof on my phone. After 55 minutes was hung up on. I don't know what happened to tmobile.  The manager, Leo   very rude disrespectful to woman, he belittle me the entire call. I don't know why Tmobile is hiring unprofessional people that arejust outrageous and customer service representative are unprofessional not helpful at  all very incompetent when it comes to resolving issues. I'm going to find another provider.  I , dont recommend Tmobile poor service and they steal your money and charge you for services you don't have check your bill.Tmobile should be ashamed of themselves. ::;((((((((( Leo manager should be terminated immediately check phone conversation. It made me cry how rude a man can be to a female customer:::(((((((((",0
"Where to get started? Buckle up for the complete crap show that is t-mobile kids bc its a doozy.To start.. i have a samsung galaxy s22Ultra i wanted to keep my phone when i changed servies to t mobile. The man at the store told me i had to BUY a phone from them in order to get the sim card for tmobile. My daughter also got a phone. We were told her phone was only 30 and mine was 7 and that was it we just had to pay the start up. WELL LET ME TELL YOU thats where the lies began. I was NOT informed id be paying MONTHLY on the phones. Two phones one that I didnt even NEED bc i had my own phone. Their customer service told me i didnt need to buy a phone for the sim card.. but dude in store said i did.They told me my bill would be 80 a month for 2 lines of UNLIMITED 5G NEVER SLOWS DOWN SERVICE.... my bill is about 98 a month and more often than not random charges get put on my bill.""My speeds will never slow down no matter how much data I use"" bold face lie. My data slows down and i have to CALL customer service for them to reset it. They told me to call every month to have it done if it slows down. Why should I have to?!?! I was blatantly lied to by this crook of a company on so many aspects of this entire situation.The service is trash. My phone takes forever to load things even on their ""5G"" and half the time my phone goes to 4GLTE WHICH IS SLOWER THAN WHAT I PAY FOR!! I have to use my wifi at home lately bc service is so slow things wont load its ridiculous.  Do not waste your money on this company. Shady business!",0
"This is a PSA for any T-mobile users out there. Watch yourself, cause T-mobile is out here stealing peoples money. I was with them for 2 long years. First, it started off with them telling me they could lower my bill, the price they quoted me was not the price I saw when I got my bills every month, service was ok but definitely not as good as my previous carrier. I knew almost immediately that when the contract was up, I was out! This past November it came time and I jumped to another carrier. They ported numbers over and told me to check with T-mobile to be sure that all lines shut down. December 19th I did just that, mind you it took me 3 hours in store to close because of some pin they said I set up in the initial start that 2 years later, I had never used. I spoke at that time to both in store associates and customer care and both assured me that I would only pay the balance they requested that day to complete the close of all lines. Neither would provide this so called “pin” even with my ID. I thought that would be the end, but a friend mentioned to me that they had something similar happen and their account never closed, causing another bill. Something told me with all the trouble I had with them to check on it. On Jan 29, I went in store to confirm that I was all set. Some how I had a bill larger than a normal monthly bill, I spent about an hour in there arguing with them before agreeing to pay another $288. They credited my account for an additional amount since they had seen that it was an error on their part. I verified several times that this was the last and final bill. Customer care and associates, again say that is correct and I reluctantly pay and leave.Mind you, once you port your numbers T-Mobile shuts down all access to your account and you cannot see or track any bills or payments. Well, it is now August… I receive a $175 bill from T-Mobile, but this time it comes from a bill collector! What?!? I go back in the store, they pull up all notes and agree that this bill should never have happened, call customer service and discuss my account. They have no explanation, but tell me it’s my problem, because it’s gone to collections. I will have to dispute the charge. They cannot help, customer care did not speak to me directly. I’m not gonna lye, I blew up in the store. To be clear, I NEVER received any bills. The store says they have an old address, but the debt collectors sure knew where to send it. I went home and called customer care myself.These people wouldn’t even talk to me about my account, because I don’t know the “pin” to my account. I have always used the same pins for everything, if I had a pin I know exactly what numbers it would be first of all, but no one in the company could or would talk to me about this account. Saying that they can see my account without the pin and don’t know where the charges came from??? Refusing to take care of or help in anyway! Again they told me I had to go to dispute with the debt collector and hung up in my face, when I told them that I am not dumb and know they can see all things related to my account. I called the debt collector to try to dispute it, and they told me that T-Mobile has to zero the debt out, in order to dispute and if I don’t pay it, I will see the hit to my credit. I AM PISSED AND WANT EVERYONE WHO DEALS WITH T-MOBILE TO BE AWARE….IF YOU READ THEIR REVIEWS THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE. IF YOU GOOGLE IT ALSO SHOWS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST T-MOBILE FOR WHAT APPEARS TO ALSO BE FRAUDULANT PRACTICES. PLEASE MOVE ACCORDINGLY IF YOU USE THEM FOR YOUR CARRIER. As for me, next step is either the news or a lawyer!Sorry for the long rant, I would hate for y’all to have to deal with this non-sense!",0
Purchased an upgrade on my phone through their online rep. The phone I wanted they did not have in the local store so I asked if they could ship it to the store and I pick it up there. I was told this would not be an issue so we completed the purchase and I paid taxes and activation fees. Received text and UPS tracking notification that the phone had arrived at the store and was ready for pickup. I get to the store location and was told they don’t have the phone but they can see the transaction on my account. My only option is to wait in limbo while they “do an investigation.” In the mean time the money I paid can’t be refunded and I can’t upgrade my phone or do anything until they complete their investigation. No one can tell me how long it will take or what their process involves. There is no one higher up I can speak with and nothing else they can do. I was told by the store sales person they usually don’t allow shipping to stores because this has happened before. If this is an issue why would it be an option at all. They know I don’t have the phone but someone signed for it at the store or a nearby business. Store claims the person who signed is not an employee there. I get the need to investigate but why hold me in limbo for who knows how long when they clearly know I don’t have the phone. Do better T-mobile!!,0
"Very bad experience,always sometimes wrong.Internet connection is very bad.Customer service is like unreachable. Thinking about to leave TMobile after many years beeing a customer",0
This is a failure as company! T Mobile should be ashame to call there self a company.  They charge you for everything but you can't use any of it down to your insurance. The customerservice is a joke. They love to say they will call you back personally when they want you off the phone. Total failure to it's customer's,0
Their stupid voicemail transcription they think is such a benefit is annoying. It makes it take longer for the voicemail to show up. Sometimes I have to turn my phone on and off for it to show up.  when you do changes like this make them optional. Sometimes people don't want it.,0
After 14 years as a customer and requesting an extension of 3 days until payday they shut off my service. I cannot call my doctor for medication or anything. This is ridiculous and petty on their part. I will be taking my phone to a competitor and switching service. My family and friends will also be switching as when you mess with one person sometimes it has a bigger ripple than you expected.,0
Run don't walk away from them service suks.  Tech guy messed up my phone and voicemails and the supervisor john via chat REFUSED to call me or have someone call me and I have black and white proof of this,0
We canceled service and Tmobile continued to debit account. We called customer service continued to get runaround and no resolve to situation. We where a 20 year customer and over years watched bill go up service go down switched to Xfinty,0
Ridiculous if you are able to get a hold of somebody they'll will keep you waiting for 35+ minutes. After countless texts and phone calls no reply. I bet if I wanted to sign up for a new phone somebody would be available f****** joke!,0
"Service is the best I've found, where i live.(BUT)! Why is it everytime they download something to my phone for an update it screws my phone up?!?!?!?!?!Right after DL some of my APPS don't work, I then have to REPLACE the App! I send a text message now and some kind of advertisement come up in the (D--)!!! TEXT!!! I would ask that no more DL' be sent to my phone, but then they would have some kind excuses as to why they do it, like it's a benefit to ME/AND I'M SURE THEY KNOW, WE KNOW ITS  (D--) LIE!!!Well if our Government does it then is OK, BUT NOT WITH ME!I don't desire a text, or an email telling me how sorry you are for my troubles because, I CANT STAND BEING LIED TO!!!",0
Terrible experience the CSR show no empathy and are rude,0
"-5 They owe us stars! I was lied to by a sales person. She asked if I wanted a watch. I said no. A little while into the ""new phone upgrade"" she asked again. Again I said NO. 3 more times she asked. I said I don't wear watches I will never again wear a watch and I certainly will never wear a computer on my body. She said, ""Well it comes with the phone as a gift. It's free"" I said no. She said people are using it as an insurance policy. I don't have to wear it but I can use it to locate my phone if I misplace it. She got me with logic and appealing my sense of security. SCAM ARTIST!  But it was free right?? Wrong!! She added a line $35 a month and $15 a month for the watch!! She never went over my bill even though I asked if my monthly charge was going to be the same - $83 a month. She said yes the same. THEN after a time of owning the phone I downloaded my pictures and PHOTOS OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW WERE ON MY PHONE!!!  IT IS A USED PHONE!! The store won't help, they won't connect me to the district manager, they don't believe when I say it's a used phone with glicthes and OTHER PEOPLE""S PICTURES. No one is getting back to me. And now THEY'RE COMPLAINING THAT I AM CALLING CUSTOMER CARE!!!!! Last response: ""Well I can't guarantee that anyone is going to help you. They may or may not call back."" YOU CAN'T GUARENTEE THAT ANYONE IS GOING TO DO THEIR JOB??? AND YOU'RE OK WITH SALES PEOPLE LYING??? STAY AWAY! IT IS A GERMAN OWNED COMPANY - LOOK IT UP.",0
"I am 9 months pregnant. Less than two weeks from delivering. My husband and I needed to use this paycheck to get the last few baby items we needed before the baby arrives so even though we do not usually we decided to split our payment as T-Mobile allows. I wanted to pay half and the other half in two weeks. But T-Mobile only allowed for first payment in two weeks and the second in a month. Silly I thought, so I made the first payment (unknowingly doing so in an amount that was 1 cent off) through the app and intending to call T-Mobile later to cancel one of the auto pays. As I have done in the past. The customer service rep I got when I did call today, two weeks later was not only not helpful and rude but just kept telling me over and over again how this was my fault and she can't do anything. I made a fuss and she kept putting me on hold but resolved that if I made the minimum payment of $1.50 that would take care of the first payment and they could cancel the auto pay. This I was fine with and was so frustrated and crying I just wanted off the phone at this point. With the issue resolved we got off the phone and I took a much needed nap. The customer service rep continues calling and texting while I'm sleeping and I finally answer for her to tell me oh hey that didn't work and it will be charging you tomorrow, with zero recommendations and basically just telling me I'm screwed. T-Mobile is a freaking joke and I'll do nothing but tell everyone how awful your company is and I will be taking my business elsewhere as soon as possible. Great customer service not trying to solve anything and doing nothing but blaming the customer!",0
"Terrible experience with T-Mobile's customers' service.Paid the phone on May 1st, T-Mobile sent the wrong phone, returned the equipment,  has to pay again to get the correct phone.  The refund never came back after 3 months with numerous phone calls,  talking to over 20 different agents, every time they gave wrong story,  still fighting for the refund..",0
This is about the internet box that's supposed to be the best.(oakhillsCalifornia 92344)..it's not for 8 months I called about once every week to get it working and was replaced 4 times and about 19 techs but the service was never there heard every excuse...they said I will get a full refund but nothing,0
If I could give negative 5 I would. Their customer service is awful and what they tell you in the store is different than what they tell you over the phone or from one person to another. No consistency in processes and no idea how to be helpful at all.,0
Straight garbage. I got sos in my room. My ROOM. And the paying system is goofy,0
"I wrote a review about the awful service I received at a Tmobile store. I gave them a 1 star rating. A ""supposed "" owner replied to the review with his email address. So I decided to take him up on his offer to discuss my review. Turns out that the email address was phony and probably the name of the owner as well! Tmobile is very helpful when you are signing up for a service. But when it's necessary to cancel the service, they aren't so helpful anymore! I had signed up for the 5g internet service to use at our campground park model. It didn't work very well and I took the modem device back to the Tmobile store I got it from to cancel the service. All of a sudden, I'm not allowed to return the device and they are not allowed to cancel the service either. I was told I had to call a number to cancel, they would email me a return label, then I had to box it up and take it to UPS within 14 days to return it. RIDICULOUS!!",0
"T-Mobile is trash! If I could give them zero stars I would. Customer service is horrendous, rude and they over promise and do not deliver. They are not for the customer, they over charge us. I have had several times when my service was interrupted unnecessarily and added restore fees and they wouldn’t remove the fees but restored service and none of this was no fault of mine and all they could say is I apologize, this company is so un professional it’s ridiculous. I am very displeased and plan on leaving after years. I highly DO NOT recommend",0
When we set up our lines and bought our smart watches they accidentally charged us for an extra watch line. We unfortunately didn’t catch it and when we did they only refunded us 8 months out of 24 months. The person we spoke with would not transfer us to a manager and said that the manager said we would have to just eat the cost. He would not come to the phone. I find this ridiculous. 21 years with Sprint and we never had issues with service before. They get bought out by T Mobile and it’s been nothing but problems. Their home internet service is terrible.,0
"If I could give them a (-5 star) I would. I dread being with this company and is seriously going to change companies as soon as I get a chance to. The way this economy is setup its already difficult for one person to manage paying their necessities like rent/mortgage, utilities etc, it makes no sense having to pay a phone bill that’s almost equal to the same amount as the electrical bill. This company rates are ridiculous and have no problem shutting you off. Knowing everyone needs a way to communicate, uses this to their advantage to rip people off.",0
"I am deeply disappointed with the service provided by T-Mobile. We agreed to a two-week free trial on June 21, 2024, after two of their representatives visited our office. They set up the service on June 27, but it was not functional. They came back on July 1 to fix it, but within 20 minutes of their departure, our systems crashed due to issues with the T-Mobile network, causing us to lose access to our patient database.Despite multiple attempts to get help from T-Mobile, we were met with unresponsive support. I had to manually troubleshoot the issue and revert to our original internet service. We wanted to cancel the trial, but were told we needed to visit a T-Mobile store. Due to the 4th of July weekend, we couldn’t get there until July 8, which was still within the trial period from the second setup.Now, we are being billed for the service despite the numerous issues we encountered. Every attempt to resolve this by phone has resulted in being put on hold or transferred to incorrect departments. This level of customer service is unacceptable and has caused significant disruption to our operations.I would not recommend T-Mobile based on this experience. The lack of effective support and resolution to our problem has been extremely frustrating.",0
"July 5, 2024 I was going to switch to Verizon. I had such poor service with them that I cancelled the request to port my number over and use their service. That's when my trouble ramped up with T Mobile. Ever since attempting to switch he can receive texts messages from me but I can't get text messages from my spouse. We can call each other. . He called his carrier and they said they show that I have no service.  I get text messages from others and received them from others with no issue. I talked to the T Mobile tech people who couldn't resolve the issue. They said they would call me back. They never did. This was mid July. I logged into my account and they have also now completely messed up my billing. They said I am passed due and I have not been passed due with them ever. All I did was change my payment method. I talked to someone else today 7/28/2024 and they said they would fix my bill but it still looks messed up to me as it still looks like I am passed due. If you don't charge my payment method how can you say I am passed due? They are also billing me money beyond my usual monthly payments and I don't know what for and it could not be explained to me. I have been with T Mobile for over 20 years and the whole reason I tried to switch in the first place is because I didn't want to wait in line for a phone for three hours. I want my bill corrected, I want my current payment method to be used to pay my bill, and I want my phone fixed. I would also like a free new phone after 20 years and all of this aggravation I deserve it.",0
"T-Mobile is the worst service, I literally got a phone call because I left a penny off of my payment.  I woke up to my phone being cut off.  The customer service is horrible and they can never seem to help with anything.  I am seeking another phone carrier.  TMobile is a scam.",0
"I switched to T-Mobile (July 2024), and what a mistake.  I was sold on several promotions to include free Hulu.  I was told by the sales person that I could add to my Hulu subscription (after activation), additional subscriptions such as Disney and ESPN+, only later to find out that I can't add any additional subscriptions without giving up my free Hulu.  During the switch over to T-Mobile, one of the phones could not make cellular calls.  In speaking with Technical support they told me the phone had to be taken to a T-Mobile store.  We did, and they were able to get the phone working, but we were also told the fix could have been done over the phone with Technical support.  Further, my first bill did not include any of the discounts associated with my service plan.  Buyer beware.  If I had it to do over again I would never had made the switch to T-Mobile.",0
"T-mobile does false advertising. They had a promotional offer for their home internet, that if you add a t-mobile home internet, you’d receive a 50 inch 4k Amazon TV, valued at $450. I added t-mobile home internet, applied for the promotion, and was approved to receive the promotional offer, however, t-mobile did not send me the tv. After over 23 hours of phone conversations with different departments of t-mobile’s customer service, the t-mobile agent only offered a $260 credit toward my account. I refused the $260 and asked for the tv that I was offered or the $450 value. And t-mobile refused my request. This is false advertising and t-mobile should know better and not treat their customers this way. They should honor what they promised, either the tv or the value of the promotion.",0
"I was a T-Mobile customer for about three months for my business.  When I signed up, I was promised rebates for bringing my own device and for switching from a competitor.  Understandably, there was a 90 day wait for those rebates.  However, the rep also promised me a $100 credit per month for four months to cover a Comcast Mobile termination fee.  I had this in writing from the T-Mobile sales rep.  I had to call each month for over one hour each time and talk to various reps to get the credit.  It was a fight every month.  In addition, I live in Delaware near the beach and the reception was horrible.  Dropped calls frequently (including when I was calling T-Mobile customer service).  Yes, the service reps are very nice but the bottom line was the never did what they said they were going to do and the overall network service in both Maryland and Delaware was marginal at best (on all the lines I had).  When I finally dropped T-Mobile I was four days into the next billing cycle.  They charge for the for the full month and do not pro rate.  It was a very bad experience dealing with the network quality and literally hours on the phone with them trying to settle billing issues.",0
Worst customer service of any company ever with the exception of PayPal ! I don't get my text from the Braves or PayPal every other text I get. I miss the first five innings of the Braves game because you have to have a smartphone to get in the gate they don't have paper tickets anymore. And this T-Mobile phone couldn't get text from the Braves for some idiotic reason. So T-Mobile ruined my birthday I'm canceling my service with them and those incompetent morons will never get another cent from me ! And they almost got me evicted when I couldn't get a text code to confirm my identity for 3 months now. Stay away from T-Mobile and PayPal or you could get a nervous breakdown like me. Cried and yelled at them for hours now the last three days and this is the third time their incompetence has caused me great misery ! Phug T-Mobile 💩,0
When I tell you this has been the worst experience and I've been with them for 8 years!  Their reps need to be brought back yo the US and retrained!  I have taken over my mom's plan years ago were speaking 8 years ago... On yhe phone told them etc.  I'm not even going to explain the crazy they took me through today but the rep keeps telling me they need to speak with my 87 year old Mom that has demitia! I told them I have POA days ago... But he keeps asking to speak with her...  Whyyyyy! I offered to send it over !  Ridiculous!,0
"Do NOT use T mobile.   We were a Sprint customer for over 20 years.  They switched to T mobile and everything changed especially the customer service.  We were given a third line for free.  When we switched companies, they wouldn’t let us take the line number with us for the third line so we canceled the number.   They charged us almost $300 to cancel the free line.  I fought it but they said it was a valid charge.  How???   We weren’t under a contract and the line was free.  Absolutely garbage.  Everyone I talked to was clueless and rude.",0
Was told my credit card would be refunded. When I called back I was told the refund was denied. After I expressed my anger the agent spoke to her supervisor and I was told I would receive an email the next day stating I would be receiving a refund. I never received an email or a refund as of today. I am still chasing the refund for the principal of it.,0
"I went to the T-Mobile store on Power and McKellips in Mesa, AZ. My son and I went in to buy new iPhones. We were told that we could get 2 iPhone 14’s for free since we had 4 lines. That wasn’t what we wanted.. but they convinced us to get them. Then when my phone was finishing setting up and the glass was already on.. another employee told us that we had been overcharged for the glass accessory. Last night I was watching TV, and a T-Mobile commercial came on. They said that the deal was 2 iPhone 15’s for free with 4 lines. I was furious!! I had been lied to and cheated. I never had these issues with Sprint. This will make me not trust people who sell me things. I am furious and will tell everyone who will listen. T-Mobile stinks!!",0
"T-Mobile customer care, suck big time, the peoples don't know what their ate doing, don't care what problem you are having don't have the knowledge to resolves your problem Everytime I call get the same thing my call gets disconnected today it happen to me 2 times, I was left again with no",0
"Worst company ever. I made a new deal with them with agreement,  once I changed from my previous company to them , they changed everything.  Don't trust them.",0
"For several months, my bill has been incorrect.  Each biilling cycle I must go into the store and have it corrected,  The store manager calls the company offices and says they fixed it.  Just got another incorrect bill. Maybe they should let me move in since I am there so often  Follow up to above - upper management says the store was wrong, and my bill is $26 more per month than what I was quoted! I am filing a complaint with the FCC and the Minnesota State Attorney Generals office.",0
"Hey good afternoon !I have been with so much trouble with T-Mobile since when I upgrade my account.I have Been waiting since march 13 with some promotion was promised, but I never get that.So I was switching my plan and I requested many times to my new plan should covered so I can switch my phone with the promotion for $800 and have internet out the countryI ask the lady about magent plan because I had before and I had both of this request ed working well - the internet and the switch with 830 credit.So I switched my plan and she said I can get the phone switched with her on the call but will take 5 business day to get the new one, how I work with my phone and I don’t want wait she said I can do on the store, when I got on the store they said this promotion doesn’t exist.I called again on the same day and they told me my plan is not covered and this promotion doesn’t exist for my plan.Recap:  in the morning the lady switched my plan she said was covered and I have 2 different promotions 1) with the 800 because I’m upgraded my line and the other was 2) the 830 because I’m on magent planSo until that date I have been fighting because I can’t get this promotion the lady told me on the phoneThe other time,  I spoke with some representative they put a new line to fix my problem and got worse because he never did what he said, he told me he just will put a new line until a get the promotion and after he will cancel. He just disappear and I start pay for two different plans - magenta plans and go 5g plan. I never agreed with that. I told him, he can put if cost the $10 dollars like he told me and if he cancel after.The other time, other representative told me he will put a credit monthly because all the mess the other representative was making on my bill, on the first month (I think was may) he put a credit, but after he just disappear and no credit anymore. I supposed to just to start pay something just in July, because of the promotion I got, but they put a line on my bills and now everything is a messThe other representative she just told T-Mobile can’t do anything. So I was tired and said ok to them cancel the new line (I never requested) so I lost the promotion because was attached to the new line. I started pay for the phone in full, but I never got my phone I send before back, because I just send my phone because I was doing a trade with $830 credit.Just remembered that wasn’t the deal since the beginning, because the deal was I upgrade my line and get the credit for $830 credit and switch my phone.July 13th I tried again, I spoke with the supervisor Anthonyalison he told me he will open a investigation and call back in 3 days, one week pass and nothing he never call me back. When I spoke to him, he told my bill was $161, I was very angry about this price for 1 line, and he said he saw wrong and this amount wasn’t my bills. After I finished the chat with I check my app and my bill was $161, for 2 lines I never requested and I have already cancelled.On Monday July 15th was my last try to fix this mess, I call again and make sure I’m speaking with someone representative based in Florida, because I went also to the store, but just the representative could fix this mess because they did that, and the representative on the store said for I call Monday to Friday and speak with someone from here, they know better what they are doing them other representatives from other countries. I did that, call on Monday speak with Jen, she told sorry many times and she said she will fix my problem, after explain to her all the problem she ask to speak with her supervisor and she will fix. She ask me to call me back on Friday -July 19th at 9am because she needs check with other departments and she told they have to fix because they give wrong information. Of course one more time, on more person didn’t call me back or said anything or fix my problem.since march I have been paying my bills wrong and much higher than I should. I have been speaking with more than 8 representatives/ supervisors to fix this problem, and nobody care. I’m exhausted. Every month my bills come with a different amount. I just want what exactly was promised to me and done and I can’t keep call or text every month.",0
All I’m going to state is STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY .Do not waste your money or time on this company that’s the most transparent warning ⚠️ I can provide. DO NOT PURCHASE T-Mobile service. Save yourself now.,0
"Their service socks. I'm a prior customer of Sprint and since they took over the service has went down. I have had to call them every day this week about me not being able to have a conversation with people cause my lines keep breaking u or they can't hear me at all. Still nothing is being done. Sending a new phone, but it's not the phone, it's in their towers. Told me at first they were working on the towers, then they had completed the work, but it's still happening. I tried a phone with AT&T service and it works perfect. Been with them over 20 years. Bout time to find another provider.",0
"I joined T-mobile when it was the ""uncarrier"" under Jonh Legere.  The service wasn't always great, but they tried, and I wanted to support that.  We were on a family plan, and after about 15 years, and as the kids aged, it made sense for us to switch to a different carrier that better fit our needs.  That's when the nightmare started.I got an letter saying that I never returned a 4G range extender that I received in 2012.  Yes, 4G and 2012.  It had never worked for us, so we returned it to the store at least 7 years ago.   There was no indication on our account that T-Mobile still thought we had it, so I had long since lost any receipt -- it was off the account, so why hold it?So I called T-mobile at least 10 times over 7 months.  First they said they were trying to locate it, then said I'd receive a credit since they found it.  The credit hadn't been issued, so I called again, at which time they said that since they had no record of it, I owed the full original price, plus a late fee, and there was no way to appeal.  Remember: this was a 4G (which is seldom used) device that was over 12 years old and they told me that they would issue a credit ... until today.  Oh, and if I didn't pay, they'd ding my credit rating.So today I paid over $200 to be done forever with T-mobile.  I hope other people have better experiences, and I loved ""old""  T-mobile, but I couldn't recommend T-mobile of today.  To say for months that I was all set, then to turn on a dime -- for a device with no value that they should have known I returned -- is (IMO) terrible service, so to anyone who asks, I'd recommend trying another carrier.",0
"I had a frustrating experience with T-Mobile earlier this year. The service representative provided a lot of misinformation and didn't represent the T-Mobile brand well at all. I was misled about qualifying for the $300 gift card, which I never received. Additionally, I was billed $6.26 for an invalid charge, which was the main reason I decided to switch my service back to Spectrum. When I called customer service to resolve the bill, the representative claimed he needed manager approval but didn't offer any real assistance. Overall, my experience was disappointing, and I hope T-Mobile improves its customer service.",0
"Ever since I've had T-Mobile, it's been a joak. Today was icing on the 28th of June for the month of July end. Store then on the 18th I wake up to my phone and my internet being turned off saying that I needed to pay $45.06. I had to pay that cause I needed the phone.  And when I paid it they're telling me they're gonna charge me in additional Twenty dollars per line that got disconnected I would not recommended them to my worst enemy there always fees every month it is a new fee and won't happen again I am going to pay my phones off and change my services if You're thinking about switching to t mobile DON'T DO IT learn from my mistake",0
"Recently switched my service from Verizon to T-Mobile. I called & got prices on phones / plans, etc. I asked specific questions & made very notes on what I was told. 3 phones were supposed to be $0 per month after credit (get an Iphone on us!) Asked several times, so..what is the monthly credit on each bill? $34.59 each month for 3 dif lines for a total due of $0; one other line was supposed to be credited at $16.67 per month for a total due of $17.92. Basically a total of $17.92 due for 4 lines. When the bill comes due, its actually $47.51 for 4 lines of equipment. Im told no one can fix it. I have made numerous calls, talked to a 'supervisor' and 'Ass. Coach' and still told no one can fix it. Now they have my trade-in phones that were all good and paid for.",0
"This company's software will flag your account. Lock your card, keep you from accessing your money and they won't do anything about it. They'll refresh your card and you have to wait 24 hours to access your money. This place is c*** I would not recommend it to anybody.",0
"We signed up and paid the tax on the phones and router.  Bryan Johnson said he's the main boss of the business unit out of Nashville Tennessee and promised us he would personally handle our getting activated.  He failed to ever answer us back.Then after 5 days we recieved a month's bill for $206.00.  Keep in mind we still don't have internet or use of our new phones and still recieved a bill anyway.After complaining to countless other so called specialists we were told we still have to pay our month's bill even know we sent back all phones and router and never received service.What a bunch of Losers, especially Bryan Johnson!!!",0
I bought a phone directly from Samsung that was unlocked. You could choose a carrier you wanted so I went with T-Mobile. The phone cost $1104. I decided to change carriers. The phone and the T-Mobile account are completely paid for. The phone however is locked to T-Mobile and they don't know how to unlock it. I am stuck with an $1100 phone that is useless. Samsung says it's T-Mobile. T-Mobile says it's Samsung. Who is responsible?,0
"Incompetent helpBeginning Feb 12th I reported that my line was not receiving one time passwords (OTP) and could they add code or whatever was missing.  They never fixed it (I would have gone to another carrier but they had the best signal in the neighborhood. This OTP issue was reported to them about 20 times with their same nonsense and they put in a service ticket and nothing was wrong on their end, even went to T-M store who checked with service and no one can help.  On May 14 I chatted with Felicia who had the problem fixed since T-M set up the line incorrectly- I told them that on Feb 12th!I am updating due to the Sept 2024 experience. I received an email from them (T-M) saying my service was suspended for non-payment.  No line or messages were working- Since I was auto-pay, I checked my credit card and saw that I did pay T-M.  Called and the automated system immediately said did I want to pay and restore service. Assuming that the ""extra""  payment would be in my account and I could restore service quickly, I paid again.  Still no service.  Finally spoke to someone who could see that I paid twice.  Took them 24 hours to restore the line.  Messages were still blocked by T-M for 7 days!!! until they fully restored service.  They gave me a credit but I would have preferred to have service.  These issues should not be a surprise to the CEO if he is doing his job!",0
"My boyfriend had just switched to T Mobile while he was cleaning up flood damage in MN and had destroyed his previous phone in the water. We were told we could drive to a store to pay his bill as he  did not want to be late. There were a total of 5 people working at this location. We were aware that a couple of them were training, however no one in the store really had a solid idea on how to handle a simple transaction. They had originally told us that we could make the payment no problem, then were informed that they would not accept a check so we said okay, we can pay cash. Then we were told they could do an e check but that also turned out to be impossible somehow. When it was decided that we would just pay cash, the employee informed us that it would be an extra $5.00 charge to pay in store! That is horrible customer service. We made sure to drive to a location to pay the bill to your company so it would not be late and we are going to be punished for that? For a new customer, or any customer for that matter, it does not show much confidence in the company.",0
"I signed up for a deal that they take automatically from my checking account. Not the credit card but checking account. That should have been the red flag for me. But I went ahead with this. The deal was that I pay for their service and for the phone. At the end of 24 months period the phone was supposed to be unlocked and mine. The service was bad, the technical support was unhelpful, their customer service rude and useless. Of course, no surprise that I wanted to leave at the end of this 24 month period. It was a full time job to get my account number and a transfer code from them Finally I got that and move on to another carrier. But they locked my phone and it's been several days I am trying them to get it unlock and they blame Samsung, Florida, heat anything in the world but not unlocking the phone . They have no legal right to keep it but they know that take them to court is a hassle so they steal. This company has nothing to offer. They are just thieves!",0
"I recently had a highly troubling experience with T-Mobile that left me deeply dissatisfied. Somehow, someone managed to gain access to my account. It started with a call from a person impersonating a T-Mobile employee from the loyalty department. They knew all my personal details, including how long I've been with T-Mobile, how many lines I have, my exact monthly bill, and more. They promised me a discount on my bills and even deposited money into my T-Mobile account to appear legitimate.The impersonator offered me two free iPhone 15 1TB devices, but instead, I received iPhone 15s with only 500MB. They tracked the delivery and knew exactly when the phones would arrive. After realizing the mistake, they called to apologize and provided a return address to send the phones back. Everything happened so quickly that it felt like a whirlwind.When I reported the incident to T-Mobile, I expected them to take swift action to resolve the issue. Instead, they informed me that since the phones were delivered to my house and someone in my home signed for them, they are not responsible. Despite my detailed report, T-Mobile refuses to take accountability, leaving me to bear the cost of the phones.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and has shaken my trust in T-Mobile's security measures. Their lack of support in resolving this matter is deeply disappointing, and I am now stuck with a significant financial burden due to their inadequate handling of the situation.",0
"T-Mobile is like  scam. When I sign up with them at Costco, they Promise me with all that rebate and promotion And the plans I need to sign up. After I sign up and send in all my rebate three months later, they say I don’t qualify with my current plans So they tell me to upgrade my plan in order to qualify and switch back to my original plan after. but now when I asked them to switch me back to the original plan, they say the price going up so do not believe anything they told you in the promotion because they will find a way to make you pay them back in two years like me I’m stuck with them for two years 😢",0
"Whatever experience you have with Tmobile it will only get worse when you try to cancel service!Even if you own your own phone, they will keep charging your bankcard… then when you call to get them to stop they turn on the nasty full blast. Forgot or never knew your pin code? Well now you have to go into a store and they will photograph your drivers license just to get a pin code so you can talk to people in the Philippines who hate your guts!! Why do they hate you? Because they have to work for peanuts talking to you. Doesn’t matter that they caused your problem or they make mistakes that cost you hours of time and thousands of dollars… no they have the power to put you on hold, the power to disconnect the call so you can burn more time. They have the power to steal your money and if you complain they will steal even more. Once a decent company they now operate like Time Share con artists. They must have promoted the worst from Sprint after they bought that heap.After hours of being abused and being forced to go to a Tmobile store to prove who I am just so I can talk to an fill in the blank, to beg them to stop stealing my money as I had no account with them for 4 months… I get one who promises to immediately refund me for the unauthorized theft. Note that they never sent me a bill for these months of charges. I used no service and had no device of theirs! So she promises to refund me. Instead she makes the mistake of double charging me for all months of service that were supposed to be credited!! How fill in the blank can a person get? So I make the mistake of calling yet again (5 hrs now!!) and finally get someone who claims to be a supervisor. Wants to blame the whole thing on me! Tell me how to talk and not so loudly!!! Yes she too promised to remove the charges and the double charges and also errs and triple charges me!! Totally insane. The company has turned into a scam. Full on scam! God help the folks who are employed to rip us off and have no other way to make a living. You might also ask why after 15 years would I ditch Tmobile and go to Visible? Tmobile started charging me an extra $10 per month, because they billed my credit card not my bank directly. No way was I going to give these fill in the blank my bank account no!!! I had always used a credit card and was charged in advance each month. Nowhere in my agreement did it say they could charge $10 for using a credit card. They claim that banks started charging them higher fees!!! Liars!! Banks are not charging them more than 1.75% For my bill that would have been about $1.20 and banks were charging that all along. Some greedy fill in the blank at Tmobile thought it would be a good idea to steal another $9 from senior citizens. I began raising disputes on the $10 charge and calling out the breach of contract. They kept up the charges so I found a better deal at Visible. Now Tmobile is worse than Sprint was. Its become the telecom sewer. Tmobile cons and steals then hire impoverished uneducated people with attitudes in a 3rd world country to terrorize you. This is the criminal state of Telecom today. Yes I filed complaints with the FCC, my attorney general, and bank. I will sue if necessary!!!",0

"I have been a T-Mobile customer for many many years. I was recently offered an upgrade by 2 different sales people. 3 lines for $165 and free iphones. Received my phones and the first bill. I'm being charges monthly for each phone. After many phone calls to customer service i'm being told that they would never offer a free phone. Then they promised to provide a 30$ monthly credit for phone charge, but that was a lie too. That will never happen. All i hear is that i'm sorry. We made a mistake. Don't ever buy T-mobile service. They steal your money",0
Very dishonest company they do not do what they say overcharging our bill.wish I would have stayed with AT&T will switch when I can get out of contract,0
I have made atleast 5 long calls. In desperation stopped at different stores at least 5 times and no help getting my visual voice mail. The people on the help line just repeat same stuff everytime that does not work. On 2nd call right now for today supposedly getting manager ...still on hold.. if this call sucks like the rest then I'm going across street to at &t..okay call just hung up. I'm done .,0
"Terrible customer service, but what would you expect from a dishonest company. Every month when I look at my bill, I have to spend an hour or more on the phone with Tmobile trying to get some sneaky additional fees removed. After wasting time trying to upsell me to new services, they inevitably admit that the charges were added in error, but next month it happens again. I think they just keep trying, believing that eventually they can pass one by me without my noticing. These fees range from $50 to over $100 per month. Agents are polite but feel free to lie as necessary to make the customer happy. Just because you call in and get your complaint ""resolved"" does not mean that you are not going to have to call in again when you find that your bill is still incorrect and they have charged your card. Then be prepared to waste more time with agents who assume you are in the wrong and fail to grasp the problem. An additional trick they use is to charge you the erroneous fees but say that they will reduce your next month's bill by the amount in question. However on the next bill, they will have made the adjustment but added some other false fees and random deductions to create lots of confusion which is far beyond any of their support team's capability of understanding. I suppose they are banking on customers just giving up. Frustrating!",0
"I have been with tmobile over 6 years, never miss a bill etc. After years of trying to get me to upgrade to more expensive plan without success, all of a sudden my bill is increased.

"I cannot express my disgust with the new t mobile adequately, but will try. I was a customer several years ago, and T Mo had great regional CS who answered within a few every time. For personal reasons ( left the country) I disconnected, then returned when back in the states. MY GOD. the new cs system is the worst WITH any corporation I know of. Since buying a phone (trade-in, but they have lied repeatedly that they never received it) I have had to contact CS 6 times, each time literally an hour wait for a sweet Phillipina, who promises solutions, which rarely appear. Not their fault, I'm not doing some racist stuff here, just TERRIBLE CORPORATE DIRECTION results. I Am now trying to unlock the paid for phone I bought from them 2 months ago, and none of the site stuff works, 2 CS agents ( 2 hours wait) are unable to unlock, now advised to wait 48 hours and call back. What a lesson in enshitification of a previously good company. Stay away!",0
I had them for about 3 years and my mom lost her phone. I called to see if they were offering any promotions on the phones. They said we I was eligible for free upgrade. We sent 4 phones to get 4 new phones. They can’t find 2 and they put me in as a promotion to by when get one free with the additional line. So instead of paying for the tax I’m now paying for 6 lines of services and 2 new phones. So my bill went from paying 127 a month I am now payin 222 per month. Every time I call 1-3 times per month. The same thing happens every time. A supervisor tells me they are going to escalate it and get back to me and no one ever does. Stay away from them!,0
Unbelievable ! Wanted to switch from Verizon to t mobile. T mobile wanted to check my credit score !!! Have never seen this!! How can I allow you to check and hurt my credit score to get phone line or just to switch !!? You get a new customer and I have to pay for it by hurting my credit!! Unbelievable. I would never recommend t mobile to anyone,0
Worst there is! They don't help unless it's taking your money! Be careful they steal your hard earned money!!! 🤬,0
"I switched from Verizon to T-mobile, they offered a $200 gift card for the mobile phone switch and a $50 card for going with their home internet. A year later still don't have either. Provided them the rebate codes THEY provided me, said the $200 card will ship soon, a month later, nothing. The home internet works well, the phone coverage and service isn't as good as Verizon. Customer service is the same.",0
"They are so desperate to take there long time customers and lose them then have a respectable business.  Pay my bill every month through my bank on 13th and last month June 2024 the charged me a late fee $7, but not any other months has it been late. T-Mobile tatic to make you pay on their website or set up where these fraud folks can automatically debit your account. They make mistakes and then how would they rectify correctly in a timely manner, they won't b/c they don't give a crap!!",0
I can have 5g internet both mobile and in home wifi with perfect connection and somehow unable to get anything done cause its always loading and even received calls and missed them the voicemail comes thru a day late i cannot express enough that tmobile is just garbage,0
Business account terror line of credit stolen after going online to purchase devices for my new business account was asked to provide ID and business info and was approved for $5000 for business credit and when I was asked to pay the sales tax swiped my card for $358 the store Rep had to call customer service and verify my bank account over the phone with BOA business. Once completed the rep on the phone stated he would complete the transaction and send a digital receipt to my email. He told the store rep to wait a few mins. for it to go active when she logged back in it showed I only had a $1500 business credit and he closed the first account and created a new one now the devices I was already approved for I can no longer get because my credit limit has decreased and after 3 weeks of talking to any and everyone no one seems to be able to get my business credit back on top of that 20 days later I received a bill for 6 phone lines with no devices and 3 different account open in my business name so a total of 9 lines no devices but I’m being billed customer service sucks and they will hang up when you try to get to the bottom of things.,0
"I recently wrote a review of Assurant, the company that does T-Mobile's insurance company. It wasn't a good one. I didn't really have any problem with T-Mobile, I had been with them for 2 yrs. After getting bent over by Assurant I reached out to T-Mobile thinking maybe they could help me. Their response was to inform me that I got bent over deal with it. Well I decided I would just buy another galaxy out of my own pocket but it just rubbed me wrong. So fighter pilots I'm now a straight talk wireless customer. T-Mobile has no appreciation for a good customer and they are as sorry as Assurant. Like peas in the same rotten pod",0
"Tmobile has gone down hill. They rip you off, service isn't good, add on fees , etc. All the negative reviews are true! This company was good back in 2014, but Now No!!!",0
"I have been with T-Mobile for 15 years. Originally, I was delighted with them. I recommended all of the people I knew to them. However, well before covid, their prices increased and their service decreased. Where before, an issue could be resolved with a call to customer service within minutes, the last dozen calls I have made have required multiple calls that take anywhere from 30 - 90 minutes to get a human being. Most recently, I received a $300 charge for a piece of supplemental equipment I had used since they did not have coverage in the location of my rural home and workplace, which I returned when I moved to the city. That return was not documented, and now, six years later, I am being informed of the misfile  technology that I returned.",0
I am suicidal because of this company.  This company has taken everything from me.. my job. I'm about to be homeless in a month. I can't return a 800$ bike. I've lost 20 pounds because I can only afford to eat once a day. The reason is because I dropped my phone in the water. Had insurance got a new phone. They don't have a store around here (wish I would have been informed) in fact it's a different state. They can't send an activation code to my phone because the sim isn't activated makes no sense. I can't go out of state to get a frighten code because I am disabled. They are going back and forth back and forth. Telling me they guarantee it's fixed to telling me there's no way around it. It's making things that much worse with my mental health when they do this to me. The reason I cannot access all my accounts is because I changed every account to just one password. I forgot to write them down and was going to  but then i dropped my phone in water. worked as a 3rd party Amazon seller (job lost) apartment (I'll be homeless in a month) rapid weightloss (lost 20 pounds in the past month because I can no longer afford to eat) I cannot access my home security system (which is awesome because there's been an influx of break ins where I live) I don't know what I'm gonna do so I can only see one way out. This company has taken everything from me. I've never been suicidal in my life and now I have it all planned out. I'm making arrangements to give all my stuff away and just let my family know just how much I love them. I never thought getting a phone would be the reason I leave this world. I've never experienced worse customer service in my life. They really could care less about the customer and only care about money.,0
Tmobile is a fraud. There a serial rip off to the public and they need to be shut down for taking advantage of customers and price gouging there contracts and basically popular for ripping people off and up selling there products in ways that leave consumers in debt. They also are extremely disrespectful when your bill is due and they literally will lie on the automated line saying there customer service is closed when my prepaid bill lapsed but any other time they were open when my bill was active lmfao. This is a seriously evil and screwed up cut throat company and i can't wait until tmobile dies.,0
They lied about the plan they promised and then had the gall to steal my trade in. Every time you call in its the same 1hr conversation explaining the problem all over as if no one has written a single note of previous conversations. They promised a new S24 and payoff my trade in. Got the new S24 and they are not honoring the trade as they said time ran out! But its THEM screwing the order up twice not me!! I said send me my phone back then..reply...NO! I have never been so livid nor had such horrible service from a company. Most untrained unprofessional staff EVER!! I am going elswhere as soon as my new $400 S24 is unlocked. What a joke!,0
"The T-Mobile store in Hermitage on Lebanon Rd are liars and thievesThey tried to change me 3x the restocking fee snd force me to spend more money in an upgradeThey lied about the features on an Apple Watch which brought about the returnI had to call customer service to get anything doneThe assistant mgr Marcus leads the way with lies and misinformationThis store has a lot of complaints and I hope goes out of business, either way deal with them at your own risk",0
"My wife had a Galaxy Fold 4 with a malfunctioning screen. The phone has never been damaged, but despite this, they refused a warranty exchange saying she was responsible. The screen going wonky is a known problem but they law it on the consumer saying they damaged it. Stay away from T-Mobile . . . don't walk away, RUN. I will never do business with T-Mobile ever again.",0
All I need is access to my online account.  THEY CANT DO IT.  They have had multiple people make really stupid attempts at fixing the issue but.....THEY CANT DO IT and this is a commercial account.Pathetic,0
T Mobile will extract as much money as possible from you. The company is not trusted or truthful in any sense. They promised me a great deal on a phone if I sent mine in any condition. After they received it they said the screen was cracked and will charge me an additional $26 a month for 24 months. They lied!,0
I had T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for several months before the defective router kept disconnecting and rebooting. I canceled the service and returned the router. Customer service never mentioned anything more was due. 14 days later I was charged the usual month internet fee of $50 and customer service said I had to pay for the complete billing cycle. They wouldn't even give a credit for the unused internet. I considered this a form of theft!,0
Stole $1000 dollars from my account on auto pay. They admit they made a mistake but keep telling me to call Ass-u-ran Insurance. Tmobile took the money from my account.,0
"In April 2022, while in Georgia for work, I went to a T-Mobile store to inquire about a wifi hotspot. The representative there told me about a small wifi device they had. I asked if I would be able to try out the device and T-Mobile’s service to see if it would actually work where I was and if it didn’t work, return it. He said yes.I signed up and took the device home. After trying the device and service out for 5 days, I was not able to access the internet using it. So, I returned to the store where the same representative helped me. After returning the device, he told me I would not be charged anything else and my service was canceled.For a year following that day, T-Mobile charged me $50 every month. I called them several times to request that they stop withdrawing from my account and refund the money they had taken. They told me that I had to go into a store to be helped with this.So, I went into a store. At the store, they tried to help me by calling T-Mobile’s Care department. At that point, they said that T-Mobile Care would be taking care of it - that I would not be charged anymore and I would receive a refund. That did not happen.I followed up with the store manager after yet another payment was taken out of my account. By this time it was March 2023, almost 1 year after the first charge! I never received a response from her.So, in late March of 2023, I went to my bank and asked that they place a stop payment on T-Mobile’s monthly draft from my account. They did that and refunded a portion of the money that T-Mobile wrongfully took from my account.T-Mobile has now (as of 6/17/24) reported me to a collection agency stating that I owe them $378! I do not owe T-mobile any money and in fact, they still owe me over $300!I wish I would have thought to place the stop payment with my bank after the first fraudulent charge by T-Mobile. Regardless, beware of T-Mobile.",0
"Worst customer service. I have called about the same technical issue multiple times, at least twice a month for the last 6 months, and spent at least 3 hours every time I called ... No technical knowledge what so ever, no professionalism, and a total waste of time and money ...",0
"Have been a customer with t-mobile since they started. They were recently bought over. Now my reception  has a lot of areas that don't come in where it did before. My data was unlimited to a point and would then slow down,in the 15 years I've been with boost this only occurred a couple of times. Now it's every month. And with the new owners it doesn't slow down,it stops!!!!! NO DATA AT ALL. This is a breach in my original contract stating a slow down, not a complete stop, meaning you can't get any data use on the road.You were always able to see how much data you had left before the slow down would acura. Now you can't check what you have left and it just stops working. This is the perfect situation for a class action law suit. Anybody on board,count meIn, it's not about the money,it's about being a loyal customer and a new company taking over and now trying to get more money out of you to increase their profits. Verizon may charge more, but the service is the best!!!",0
"If it was possible to give this company NO STARS that’s what they would earn. No stars. They lie to their customers. They use deceptive and discriminatory practices in everyday business. If I could switch carriers I would. It’s not because of the service. It’s because of the customer service, management, and C Level Executives that continue to let this crap go on. They only care about how much money you can give them. They don’t care about their customers. Hence their 1.3 stars rating.  Their trash. Simply put.",0
T-Mobile ripped me off. The best way to get a real response from T-Mobile for a complaint for getting ripped off is to email the CEO then  the most important thing is put in a complaint to the FCC. T-Mobile executive team must reach out to you try to resolve and then respond to the FCC within thirty days. The links for both is:  put a .com at the end of his email Mike.Sievert@T-Mobile   He is the CEO. Read this about what you file a complaint about. Then go to the FCC site and file a complaint.  Hope this helps.,0
"T-Mobile should not be trusted. While I was excited to transfer from Verizon to T-Mobile because of all the benefits and credits that I would receive, it seems that they lie and will bait you to switch and state you do not qualify for the promotions they explicitly state you will receive. I have never had a phone carrier to lie just to get you to switch from another carrier. Should have just stayed with Verizon or considered AT&T. I was told that I would receive a port-in credit which at the time that I was told, the promotion was already expired but this is what the representative sold me on in order to switch carriers, in addition the T-Mobile Representative sent me the required forms to submit to receive the credit, even offered tips on how to submit them successfully. While the promotion was being processed I called multiple times for status updates and the representative assured me that I would receive the credit, just give it time to process. Later, that promotion was denied due to it being out of the promotion period. Yes, this is an error on that T-Mobile representative's part, which the T-Mobile Care Team acknowledged, however, they do nothing to honor this.",0
Had T-Mobile Internet. Was unable to get unlimited even though on waiting list 4 times. When notified by app notification that it was tried to sign up but was declined. Found service with no data cap and returned router. First tried to charge me for damage but router was never moved in my possession. Then charged me for normal wear when they specifically say there is no extra charge for equipment. With data caps and them going back on their promises I cannot recommend their service at all. Stay away if you have any other options,0
"Long story-read if you don't want this to happen to you. When issues go on endlessly for years – it's not just a once or twice fluke nor can tower location always be to blame. So tired of hearing, “it's the towers” “it's the tower location”. Then fix tower problem or stop selling in this area.I know some people say it works so good. Some win the lottery too. Doesn't mean it's a common occurrence! Looking at tmobile rating here seems the chance of it being “so good” is same as hitting lottery jackpot. Millions to one! I truly don't know where tmobile gets those best of stats. NO ONE I mention tmobile to has anything good to say about them.Unfortunately we got it all – internet, 2 phones & watches. Tmobile internet & cell service is unreliable. No matter if home, out locally or some other city we could not count on having reliable cell service. We had 2 identical phones & side by side could have different connectivity issues. 1 working, other might not. Might work one trip, not the next. Not always same phone or in same location – just whenever either couldn't connect. Phones also would say no internet connection available when it should be cell not WiFi anyway. Later in same location it would work. Cant find directions or businesses without connection. At times no cell service at all, was garbled or dropped calls.With so many problems & internet outages I took photos & videos. Basically anytime you turned on a device requiring tmobile you knew it would probably lose connection at least once or something else. An hour show might go out 5 or 6 times, every day & at all times of the day. My photo file got so large I had to stop. Local office still looked at me as if I had 2 heads even after viewing videos of what I was telling them. Didn't care.Being so unreliable, I would not give a child a tmobile phone. I'd also discourage travelers especially those who go alone or need to rely on cell service.For travel safety & being locked into a contract, we got a prepaid account from competitor to compare with tmobile. Competitor passed consistently with flying colors, every time & everywhere! Like we knew, it was just tmobile failure. And it's not like we're in some remote part of the world or well below sea level etc. We live in town, not country. We couldn't wait to dump tmobile! We also tested internet – competitor works. They offer free internet booster if it doesn't work throughout house! Price is only a bit more, but we now have an internet system that works. Watching an hour program doesn't take 2 hours now.  Cheaper isn't better if it doesn't reliably work.When phones paid off & the ""no contracts"" contract part of bill paid off - we canceled all services May 11, 2024. Was paid up to date at that time as of recent auto-pay. Only charges from then to May 11 were now due. Said final bill will be sent. DON'T cancel before you stop auto-pay & remove payment method. It's how they overbill you. Make copies of anything important on your online account. You cannot access your online account once it's canceled. You'll be told changes have to be made online, then told if number canceled, there's no online account now. No one will help. This allows them to create charges & bill since most people don't double check for accuracy.Not being able to remove payment method, through BBB contact from tmobile Sr. Specialist Team, CEO. She took auto-pay off & most importantly reviewed account to give what was actually owed. Said made notes on account but was confident final bill would now be correct amount. Told us wait & contact her if amount was different.Arrived 6/5/24 amt almost doubled. Contacted. She got back to us with true amount owed & how to pay now there is no online account access on about 6/6. We paid this amount due within a few days. After all today is only 6/12/24. Wasn't paid today or yesterday.Tmobile is horrible!! Recap - Account current. Last auto pay 4/21 next would've been 5/21 – but canceled tmobile 5/11. Received final bill abt 6/5 still wrong amount due – contacted home office immediately & paid within days of actual amount due. Today – 6/12, just a month from our cancellation date - I receive a letter from collection agency dated 6/5 on behalf of tmobile for a crazy amount & fee on top of it for service on a paid up to date account that WE cancelled. Date of their letter shows tmobile had to contact them well before 6/5 for agency to create/mail me letter dated 6/5! Really? I am furious!!I work hard on my credit rating (another stupid thing for only businesses to legally way overcharge consumer since it's damned if you pay your bills off & damned if you don't) to have a company like this so blatantly abuse the system!!For mobile/internet service that is reliable & works - forget tmobile exists! - Just remember t-mobile service (for me) stands for Terrible Mobile Service! Go elsewher",0
"This place is terrible I made a settlement to pay my T Mobile home Internet now when I call they hang the phone on my phace I make settlement and I pay now they say I have to pay more 130,00 ?? I am taking you all to court I am so tired of this company bulshit",0
"T-Mobile customer service is a total fiasco! I moved away from T-Mobile when the company I work for introduced us to Previ. Previ still uses T-Mobile service but at a much discounted rate for corporations. During the transition I overpaid my final bill which was reflected in the last two statements. I tried the online chat feature of which they asked for my PIN to access my account. Of course they  said I had the wrong PIN# which is the PIN I had been using for years, and years as a T- mobile customer. I was told I would need to call the customer service line to get this resolved. After 30 minutes on hold I spoke to the rep and they told me I was out of luck if I didn't have the PIN. I was told I would need to drive to a T-mobile store and reset the PIN with picture ID, which I did. I then returned home and called customer service back with my new PIN in hopes of finally getting my overpayment back. Well it wasn't that easy, I was told to give the PIN and she said it was the wrong PIN.... LOL you cant make this up! She then told me I needed to call a different number which I repeated back to her because I had never heard of a number starting with 999! She assured me it was right but to call it tomorrow due to the long hold times. Well my intuition was right and she sent me to a non-existent number. I once again called the customer service line at which I spent another 20-30 minutes on hold, explained what had happened and my frustration with it taking me three days to get this resolved and still no help! So in total I was about 4 hours and having to drive to a store to reset a PIN that they said was wrong to get a 95.00 credit! This not the first time that I have experienced this with Tmobile. Shame on me for that but there will not be a third time! If the credit is not in my account in ten days I will camp on the store doorstep and have a conversation with every customer that is considering t-mobile!",0
"T-mobile billing department has been annoying, dishonest, incompetent and harassing us!",0
The Worst !!! I don't have coverage at my house I don't have coverage at work !!! I pay $93 a month for one line I paid extra for insurance and when my phone broke and I filed a claim to get a new one they sent me some off brand that's all messed up and customer service is a joke and no help for anything .,0
"Was told I would have great service in my area. Called the next day of getting the service bc we had no service, they told me a tower was down. We r in month 3 and guess what they still say tower is messed up. Can’t wait for my 2 years is up. I am out and will never use this service again.",0
"MediaRelations@tmobilecommike.sievert@tmobilecom -EMAILS THAT DONT WORK !! SCAM Trying to get help n no one is respondingSecond this that happened:Good Evening ,I would like to address fraudulent activities going on with Assurant claim department they posted a bill of 582$ on my account for a phone that was returned to the warehouse on January 8th . I have attached the Tarcking number and Date of delivery  and Person that signed for it .Now of April 6th they cahrge us the 582$ for a phone that was deliveredT-Mobile  now cut off our phones claiming we haven't  paid the bill but i paid 300$ for our bill but assurant decided they can post  a bill on our account and take the 300$ to cover a charge  for a phone that was returned  to them n signed for .This is absurd  i need a resolution  in atleast 48 hours i can't  pay for a phone thats not working and Assurant should stop stealing from people's  accountsToday April 10th Tmobile said we had to add another 176$ for them not to cut our lines off and also Assurant Jorge Morales Supervisor who was so rude and unprofessional  was called to ask about the  credit that was supposed  to post 10days after i called beginning  of last week  but now our service  was going to be disconnected again by T-Mobile because of Assurant ignorance and fraudulent  activity.I had recorded calls from Assurant and T mobile automatically .I dont understand  why Jorge ( The same guy that received the phone at the warehouse) and his team are also lying to customers  about the timeline that issue are supposed to be resolved  contrary to what T- Mobile says that it will take 2 billing cycles for the credit to post or and the charge to be taken out of the account .Assurant  needs stop  being dishonest and rude and fraudulent at this point , and this looks bad on T-Mobile brand coz i this will also be advised to other T-Mobile customers online via social  media.This is ridiculous  and unacceptable  since now our account reflects  718$ that we dont owe !Still today June 6th this issue is still not resolved  and we still getting charged  300+ over our regular bill !!!",0
"OMG....T Mobile sucks!!!!! WTAF is going.  I am actually still on hold as I write this awesome review!!! 1 Hours 5 Minutes!!!

"T-Mobile will always be the worst company to deal with.  They can’t even get plans right.  They f’d my family plan and now I’m paying 30% more.  I was originally was with them for 18 years and left them because they were so bad.  I came back because a friend mine worked for them and told me they have changed.  Nah, same ole same shyster.  After I come back from business trip, I’m switching back to Verizon.  Little more expensive but their customer service is second to none.  They don’t screw up or mislead you to think that it’s free or at discount.  Scumbags!  I have filed a FCC complaint with their billing practices.  I doubt anything will happen but I'm done with this poop bag company",0
Okay good luck with T-Mobile but the only problem is they took the payment out automatically on the wrong date said they were going to send a gift card to me and never have done that it took four times to try to correct an address because they never did corrected in the computer now they refuse the gift card I've got no credit back on my bill and I haven't got a gift card from them or a refund for their mistake I don't know what else to do I guess legal action is the only way that I can get it back plus a lot more money for pain and suffering and distress I would rather not go that direction but they seem like they could care less,0
"Their scam detection program is a joke. Literally, it labels every incoming call as a potential scam call  if the person uses their phone occasionally.",0
"This company are abysmal. Don't use them. I have spoken to them on the phone 4 times and each time I've been promised a 10 pounds refund due to an unused top up as the network would not work on my phone. This has taken place over a period of 3 to 4 months and is utterly ridiculous. Disgraceful. Obviously the don't value and have zero respect for customers, just fobbing them off.",0
T-MOBILE WAS THE WORSE COMPANY 20 YEARS AGO AND NOW EVEN WORSE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND THE SERVICE SUCKS. FINALLY I GOT RID OF T MOBILE MAFIA AFTER SUFFERING FOR 2 YEARS AS THEY WONT LET ME OUT OF CONTRACT. TODAY I  ASKED THE LYING AGENT TO REMOVE AUTO PAY SHE LIED SHE DID BUT SHE NEVER DID SHE HUNG UP AND CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THE DUE DATE YOU CAN TELL HOW FKED UP THIS COMPANY IS VERY DECEPTIVE AND NOW I AM ON HOLD FOR 3 HOURS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY LIED AND CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE TO T-MOBILE EVEN METRO PCS IS A BETTER COMPANY THAN THIS MULTI MILLIONS DOLLAR COMPANY LIKE T-MOBILE WHERE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE AND THERE SERVICE DOES NOT WORK AT THE AIRPORT METRO PCS DOES.,0
"I had service with t-mobile. Decided to go to another company. Notified them in plenty to make the switch before next billing, After speaking to reps and supervisor they concluded I owed small amount okay paid it notice in memo pd in full via Supervisor. Today I get a bill they want $10.01 more. To my understanding.They cashed the check with message pd in full.So why are they asking for more, very shoddy underhanded tactic.I would not recommend  them in any way because of this issue.",0
So I got behind on my bill. Paid 288 less than 2 weeks ago. Was going to pay 288 again in a few days (when I get paid). Billing cycle doesn't end until the 7th and today is the 1st. They shut off service and say I gotta pay 63 to restore service....customer service is a joke. Looking at switching carriers as I write this. DONE WITH T MOBILES LIES,0
The way T mobile handled my situation they do t even deserve the 1star!  When I initially ordered the phone I was happy with the amount I was going to spend on the iPhone 13 and the plan I chose.  When I got the email that it was shipped I checked the tracking immediately to see how long I would be without a phone.  When I saw the comments from ups it stated that they recieved and empty package and three away the box and was reporting the shipment damaged to t mobile.  I immediately called.  I was at work it was around 630 pm at 1am I was still on the phone trying to get another one.  They canceled my order and started a entire new contract.  It was never the same as the 1st.  I waited for the email to electronically sign I never got it then had to call again the next day.  When I called they said the second contract had been canceled due to no electronical signature how can I sign something I never got! So then a third cat contract with generated and it was never the same of course as a first one why I don't know but they were supposed to fix it did they no! So then I was in Hawaii when I got my bill and it was $400 and something dollars and I was on vacation I called they told me I had to send the phone back and that they had to send me another one why couldn't they just fix it with all the things that they can do nowadays and it's 2024 they just couldn'tType a few things on their computer and do it right or make it right no I had to send it from Hawaii back to T-Mobile and they sent me another one so here's my fourth contract still wasn't the same as the first one I had to call every single month after that to get my bill adjusted to the correct amount I was first promised every month finally on the 3rd or 4th month I said I am done I am done I'm tired of calling you all can't make this right I don't want to be a part of T-Mobile anymore so they took it back even though it had been more than the 30 days or whatever and that made me happy I was glad I was unhappy I had to send it back and start another phone deal but I was happy that they were taking this one back and I was getting away from T-Mobile and now they're saying I owe them over $100 induce for my bill but they kept my $116 that was supposed to be a refund and I have the emails and everything to prove it all I have conversations after conversations that they could all listen to but do they ever no they don't if are you I would stay far far away from T-Mobile because they're very unprofessional and they break their promises!   I can not believe they are one of the top sellers with the experience I had and am STILL having with T mobile!!! Horrible service,0
"Called about a automated message that keeps calling me 20 times or more a day for over a month.  The first person I talked to recommended their scam shield, I told them I have it and use it but all that does is send it to my voicemail and that still alerts me I have voice mail all hours of the day and night.  I asked to speak with level 2 support, they put me in hold for about 30 minutes when finally I got a ringing sound and then a message stating they can't take my call.  Excellent customer support (not), they couldn't even come back on the line to say they would call me back or anything.  After being a customer for over 20 years I'll be moving to Verizon this weekend.  T-Mobile doesn't care about their customers at all.",0
"I went to get an account with T-Mobile. The guys in the store told me I needed to call customer care. I went to my car to make this call. The guys said it would be quick. The robot at the beginning of the call said 30 minute wait time. It was an entire hour! And then the customer care guy said he needed to talk to the guys in the store. The call dropped just as I walked into the store. They guys in the store just shrugged. I walked out in frustration. A few weeks later, I got a bill for my supposed service. It was only for $5.65, but I feel it just adds insult to injury.",0
"in the past month, I have spent $18 twice for charging cables at T-Mobile. Neither one of them would last two weeks they are made in China very low quality. This is what T-Mobile thinks of their customers.",0
"customer service is the worst.  I have been a sprint customer since 1998 then they went to tmobile.Absolutely the worst experience ever.  They said they have no account associated with my phone number, well you take my automatic payment for 25 years.  This was my last draw with them.  And if you call customer service expect a 30 minute wait.  Then they direct you to a store.  Now the acquired another company this is just great, and now try to get someone who speaks the same english you speak.",0
First of all I’m not happy I had to give any stars at all. T-Mobile has become the worse mobile carrier. I purchased a phone a year ago paid cash and 30 days later phone was not working properly so I call T-Mobile. They sent me a refurbished phone after I just gave them almost 1300 dollars for a new phone. Over the last 8 months I’ve had 4 refurbished phones because they don’t work properly. I honor my part of our contract which is paying but T-Mobile doesn’t provide me with a working phone nor service. I’ve had only 2 bars on this phone since I’ve received it and now I’m on hold to get refurbished phone sent out to me again. 5 phones in one year. I’m now looking into switching with another company.,0
"I received an e-mail that informed me my monthly bill will go up by $2. That was last week. Today I see news of T-Mobile is acquiring U.S. Cellular for $4.4b. That explains the $2/mo increase… I, and others, are paying for T-Mobile’s acquisition costs. Outrageous! Insulting. I’m infuriated by this garbage. And should I find a better plan, you bet I’m going to switch. If I’m paying more for the acquisition of another cellular provider, I should receive stock + dividends. I’m just a pawn ♟️ in this larger chess game. Wish I had attorneys who’d look out for me, and Sue T-Mobile ~ formerly Primeco. I’d like to kick that pink alien 🤖 phone in the circuits.",0
"If I could give them a 0. I would they said that they were cheaper than Att and  what I got a phone And 2 watches, I open them. It was a hard time switching my phone number over from ATt And I did this in January of 2024 I wrapped the stuff up. Sent it right back that same day. They receive the items. They said that I owed them $350. In actuality, they owed me $240 for my taxes. They sent me to collections, and now I'm having to dispute this before they put it on my credit. I've talked to T-Mobile numerous times from January. Tell June. Them telling me oh yeah, we're going to send you your money back. You don't owe us anything. We're gonna put a dispute in b******* now. I'm talking to the collection agency because t mobile sent it, to collections. This has been really stressful. I've talked to multiple people at T-Mobile. Even gave them my bank account information. They said that they would put it in my account in 1 to2  days never did. Do not work with T-Mobile. They'll rip you off. And then try to send you 2 collections. I worked really hard on my credit. I have a high credit score, but they don't care",0
"I've been with T-Mobile for 23 years. My phone broke. I went in for another one. They offered me a promotion. My bill went from $85 to a 140 for a promotion. What kind of a promotion is that that you're you're making me think I have a deal but really? I'm gonna pay for it in the long run, so keep your promotions to yourself T-Mobile. Been with you 23 years. I'm about ready to exit",0
CUSTOMER CARE WAIT TIME HORRENDOUS AND INCOMPETENT,0
I would give this a minus star if I  could I had an emergency problem and this phone keeps hanging up its a disaster I recommend any one to research this company before doing business with them it's the worst service ever,0
"WORST EXPERIENCE!I am a brand new member at the excelsior springs, Mo location on Jesse James Rd and within the first 14 days I spoke to many chat reps and made 2 visits to the store. I have kept all the screenshots for evidence. Apparently it’s okay for T-Mobile sales reps to attempt to rip off customers for $750+ plus dollars when I was later told should’ve only been $70 when trying to do a buyer’s remorse. Apparently it’s okay for sales representatives to add a phone line to my account illegally without my permission and access all my banking information and cause my credit to go down 27 points. I tried to resolve this and T-Mobile ultimately told me they are not doing anything to make it right and that’s it’s my problem. I would not recommend them to anyone.",0
I've been getting slow/no data service in my area in these past 3 weeks since they didn't say they were fixing/upgrading their cell towers. This stuff is infuriating man.,0
"As a result of many problems dealing with T-Mobile customer service, I successfully got away from T-Mobile a couple of months ago; their billing practices are so miserable, my final invoice showed they owed me $89 and change. Since it's been a couple of months since I got that statement, I called this morning to ask where my money is. I had to spend 17 minutes on the phone to find out the representative had no idea how to issue my refund.So it's your job to wait when when T-Mobile's customer service doesn't know how to do their jobs. They have to go ask someone, you get to wait and the results you get back may or may not reflect the truth. Yet another reason I'm convinced I did the right thing in leaving T-Mobile.",0
"The UNCARING Carrier. Support is awful, and slow to respond. Website is slow, and extremely poorly designed. Today, my T-mobile Magenta (5 lines) is $155 per month. Next month it is $180. No change in my plan but price.. I still get the same garbage service and support for more money according to my support call today! Thank you! President sells over $6 million in stock just weeks before this change is made. Good for him. Bad for all of his customers. The NEW plans after the government allowed them to increase prices after the sprint merger had the SAME benefits as my Magenta but cost more. Now they are identical. There were guarantees and locks in place, and they simply don't care. I no longer trust a company that does not honor a guarantee. That is called lying. I am looking into another carrier now and plan to take advantage of the uncontract promise I AM entitled to (where they pay your last month if you leave do to a price change). I FULLY expect them to have lied about that guarantee also!",0
They seemingly lie about stuff and hold the phone hostage when you cancel their service lock the phone even though it's paid off.,0
"I've spent more than 2 months trying to resolve an over-billing issue - including speaking to at least 2 supervisors, who promised to review the account and call me back in 24 to 48 hours. Never received a call back and the issue is still open. Incredibly bad customer service - time to find a new carrier!",0
"Having a worst experience with T mobile, the horrible customer service ever. We ordered 3 lines and new phones which were not delivered to us as no one was at home, they received the devices back. Still we being charged for more than $500 initial fees and calling them for refund from past one month. Adding to that we received mobile service invoice for $278 today for the service we never used. Really!!! It’s a nightmare. Please be cautious while switching to T-mobile.",0
"T-mobile is THE WORST mobile service company around. I quit them in April to go back to Spectrum and they were still charging me for Ipad services, would not consider a one and last time courtesy leniency. The customer service is substandard, and no matter what promotion they are offering, you'll wind up being taxed even after you complete your plan commitment.",0
T moble agebt in May 2023 informed me that my apple tv was up and i would have to pay to keep. Now i been paying and tmoble is now saying no it on us for lifetime. Agent i was talking to did not document anyyhing we talked about. also new agent today just aburtly transfered me to tech support. Tech support was in dark why i was transfered. I was in dark i was being transfered. Such bad customer service.,0
The worst company and customer service!  ! Just for transfer phone number to another customer it took a forever ! Waiting 6 hours on the phone! Never recommend this company! Be careful guys!,0
T-Mobile sales dept is deceitful. I transferred from Verizon thinking I was saving $50 only to find out that my free watches are not free. I am paying for the watches and I am now paying for two additional lines. These two additional lines were never discussed during my phone conversation. T-Mobile refuses to do anything to rectify this situation. I clearly stated my desire to have a lower bill and was deceived.,0
"My complaint for Tmobile is that I don't think their sales associates are as concerned with helping customers as they are with making sales. I was suckered into a ""free"" smart watch a few years ago. I had to pay $40 to have it activated and then a $15 a month payment was added to my monthly bill. I could not have this removed for 2 years unless I was willing to pay the full price of the watch. They would not let me return it even after only one week.My second and more recent complaint is with my experience yesterday. I went in to upgrade my phone. Initially I was told that I would only have to pay sales tax, but because my screen was cracked my phone had no value as a trade-in. Which is fine because I've been paying their $18 a month insurance since 2017. I mentioned this to the sales associate, and instead of helping me use the insurance, which she is equipped to do, she instead tried to pitch selling me the new phone for full price with a more expensive plan. This would be ignorant to do, and not in my best interest, as I can just wait a few days for the insurance to send me a replacement to use as a trade-in.These big cellphone companies are starting to get a little too predatory for my liking, and I've decided to start looking into alternatives such as PureTalk.",0
"T-Mobile blows chunks..,!!Unfortunately this review panel makes you at least give a start even be able to put in a review but as far as I'm concerned T-Mobile is the worst and will always be the worst they ruined my business.......Their salespeople are snakes....they're liars cheats and thieves just like all of them........I wasn't able to access any of my emails phone calls because of their two step verification system on my iPhone and then took me to court to prove all this with their legion of lawyers instead of helping their customers. I'm sure I'm not the first and I definitely won't be the last as far as I can tell this company's motto should be we don't give one rat's ass about any of you. Give us your money cuz that's all we care about.",0
"T-Mobile Business Internet is (still) a mess and a joke.As both a T-Mobile Home Internet user AND T-Mobile Business Internet user, it is astounding how different the user experience is for both products.  Through my experience, it is straight forward and simple on the T-Mobile Home Internet side to have questions answered, access my account, and to ultimately receive internet.On the contrary, the business process is a mess.  For one, you work through a representative, which sounds good in theory to have that personal experience; however, that representative changed hands 4 times in the first year.  So, when they ""accidentally"" sent me 3 boxes and charged me separately for all 3 lines, you would think they'd have documentation and process in place for handing things off when a representative changes.  Nope.  Not at all.  Not only did it require multiple e-mails and phone calls to explain the situation, the previous representative was told to ""no longer work my account"" by their manager, so they couldn't step in and help if they wanted to (so I'm told).  Just an odd way to conduct business if you want to provide that ""personal"" touch through representatives.Adding another layer of poor a poor user experience.  There is a business support line (which, makes sense as representatives don't want to handle the simple day-to-day things like changing a password), but the issue here is the inconsistency of both sides forwarding you to the other for things that are above a password reset and below needing a new product.  It's incredibly frustrating as a user of this product.Oh - one more example of how poor the business home internet processes are.  When selling my business and changing hands, instead of transferring the my device and my account to the new owner, they sent him a new device and added that device onto my account.  So although I was able to cancel my device, my account remained active receiving charges from the new device they sent the new business owner.  All through this, no communication was received on my end.It's just shocking to me how poor the Business Internet process and experience is relative to the Home Internet.  Could not contrast more.",0
"Literally this company can’t get it right. Big blocks of emails will come thru all at once on various email accounts because their network is slow.  Never trust a word out of their in store reps mouths. It’s always incorrect.  Calling in to their phone line to fix incorrect information given by their in store reps I am told I am given a paltry credit and my bill is going up to a higher amount.  I then later get the notification that my bill is ready to view and to add insult to injury the higher price I was told it would go is also incorrect and it’s actually higher. In short, terrible cellular and customer service.  Avoid. Not the same company they were 15 years ago when they had good service.",0
They’re not tried to make customer to satisfy!!! I told them tried to get back the device sent it to wrong address. I can never get it back from other company. That’s why I called t-mobile to help to do something for me but they don’t want to do anything with it. Their service is SUCKS!!!,0
"I called to open and account and port my existing number (from family plan) to this new account. 15 days later, 6 representatives on the phone and 2 visits to the physical store:1. The price per month is higher than was quoted on opening the account and the plan is different2. the porting was problematic and i had to deal with it with 5 different people3. once the ""temporary"" number was canceled, i was locked out of my account as this was the number still used for text to log me in4. I was charged for 2 lines, when i only opened an account for one line and i explained this to 5 different people.5. incompetent Customer Service reps and multiple departments handing the same issue.End result: 15 days later i'm on a trip still dealing with it for hours and it's not done.Can't get ""transfer my phone to a new T-mobile account"" TODO off my list in 15 days.",0
"I switched from AT&T after being promised lower charges by T Mobile. At the time we were told that my wife also qualified for a ""free"" Samsung watch. I now get the bill and its higher than my AT&T bill was. When I queried this with T Mobile they said that the additional charges were due to the ""free"" watch. It's also too late to return the watch. Be careful of this company - they are RIPOFF artists. And their customer service sucks too!!!",0
"Hello everyone, i feel very disappointed that T-Mobile start had a bad customer service.  Not like before when you call 611 you can get Customer on the phone quickly or Automictic said press number 1 call you back or number 2 stay on the line. But at this moment they change their policy and let you wait on the line average 45minutes to 3 hours wait time. I very disappointed and i will stop the T-Mobile services and my family. Will change different provider. This is today date May, 7 2024. Bad Services hope this messages will come to the damn Owner.",0
T-Mobile ripped me off.T-Mobile ripped me off. The sales tec for t-mobile said if we upgraded to go 5 we would get phones so we did. They are billing me full retail for the phones 2 months later. I have been through 5 support people and managers with no results. They are thieves. They are telling me that they do not need to stand behind there sales tech. I did a Google search and this has happened to lots of other people. This is there business plan.,0
Do not go to the T Mobile store on Spartanburg Hwy Hendersonville NC. An employee named Conner waited on us He acted like we interrupted whatever he was doing in back room. We wanted to upgrade our phones and we were told that their service was down and that the store was completely out of phones. That was our experience.,0
"Switching to T-Mobile was the worst decision I have made in a long time. The single worst customer service I have ever received from any company period. Promised discounts not delivered. Call after call over months ended in repeated broken promises. It was clear that the rep either had no access to the history of previous conversations or did not care to look. Really seems like they have zero idea what they are doing. I’m on my way back to Verizon just as soon as I can get T-Mobile’s incompetent team to process unlocks on my phones. Don’t get lured in by the lower cost. This company is a nightmare to deal with, right down to their cringey fake “we got you” dialogue.",0
"Worst promise, free phones end up they did not honor their contract so I am paying for the phones paying for the activation. They are a bunch of scumbags.",0
I responded to a promo. It took 3 days to get results. Long waits on calls and hangup. When I did get to speak to a rep they would spend most of their time asking me to wait. The web site was even worse and basically does not work. When all was said and done the $40 promo cost me $60.,0
I had Verizon for a year and half and I never had any data problems. My phone or hotspot is always slow. I switched to -mobile because they’d pay off my phone as a promotion. It’s $50 cheaper than Verizon but everything is so slow. I regret switching providers. You get what you pay for I guess. Imma get a Ryan Reynolds’s phone!,0
"Was overcharged and support refuses to refund what they overcharged me, including their hidden fees. Also coverage and signal is garbage. They should remove 5G/6G and go back to to LTE/4G.",0
Worse customer service I've ever experienced. When you need customer service they push you to self help like all of them. Submitted an unlock request phone completely paid off. Spoke with two different reps and both said it would take a week and they would call me back neither did. Call back in spoke with supervisor named Mary. She apologize and said it would be unlocked in 48 hrs. After 2 weeks I called back and spoke with  a Harrison. He stated he needed to reverify everything and wanted to know why I wanted my phone unlocked. I told him I already spoke with supervisor and was approved for unlock. He refused. I requested a call back f4om Mary or cancel the service. He immediately canceled my service. Horrible customer service. Never a warm transfer. Never read or I guess put notes on the account. Every rep will tell you something different. After signing up you're on your own.  Buyer beware!!!!!!,0
"My family and I have been T-Mobile customers for over 20 years. On April 15 2024 my iPhone 13 Pro suddenly went into SOS mode. Meaning my phone lost service. I have not been connected to the T-Mobile network that I pay for since then. Since April 15, I have spent countless hours everyday, basically spending every moment of free time that I have calling T-Mobile tech-support to resolve this issue. I have been on multiple calls with Verizon and T-Mobile to resolve this issue. Apparently my IMEI number was blocked by Verizon, although I have never been a Verizon customer, like I mentioned above, my family, and I have only ever been T-Mobile customers for decades. Verizon has confirmed that they have unblocked my IMEI, they even confirm that with a T-Mobile supervisor on a conference call with me. I was told by the tech associate that they would call me back on a working line, knowing that my phone didn’t work, and apparently they called my blocked phone line and left a message which is another example of the carelessness and neglect of T-Mobile and my issue. Every single time I call I’m having to re-explain myself and I’ve been extremely patient with each and every T-Mobile representative I’ve spoken to never raising my voice and always respectful, but I am at my absolute limit. After multiple T-Mobile representatives have promised me with callbacks with solutions and never hearing back. I feel like this company doesn’t care about this major inconvenience, stress causing, and dangerous situation this issue has become. As a young woman in my 20s, not having any cell phone service for over a week while having to work an hour away from home has made me feel extremely unsafe and uncared for by T-Mobile as a company. I am traveling in two days and feel immensely anxious and unsafe with the idea of being out of state with no phone service. If something happens to me during my travels, how will I be able to contact my family? How is that okay?  This has affected my every day peace of mind. At this point, my entire family is ready to leave T-Mobile due to the absolute disappointment of the handling of this issue. I don’t believe it’s fair that I would have to pay for an upgrade for a new phone, which is what I’ve been told is my only immediate solution, when I have a iPhone 13 Pro in perfect condition. I am being forced to pay a new phone due to T-Mobile’s inability to solve an issue that is not my fault? That is unfair. I was told I was eligible for a warranty trade-in and then within 24 hours told I was not due to the issue being escalated and having to be seen through.I don’t think a $20 credit or a warranty replacement is worth all the time and energy I have put in by trying to fix this issue, especially as an extremely loyal T-Mobile customer, who has done nothing but treat the T-Mobile staff with upmost respect during this very frustrating issue, after the countless promises of call backs and solutions that not a single T-Mobile associate has kept.",0
"T-Mobile says iPhone on us. That means free to the consumer. They deceive you with statement credits which require you to stay with them for 24 months or you pay full price for the phone, now your a hostage. It took 3 weeks to receive a ""free phone"" just to find out it's not truly free. If it was free, I'd be free to leave anytime due to poor CS , poor signals and outright crappy overall verbage from their "" global partners"" poor understanding of the English language. There's no freedom in Amerika or with T-Mobile. If your looking for more deceptive practices in your life, hook up with Satan and his minions at T-Mobile. You'll get with anger.",0
Terrible company.  Stole $55 from me for internet service I never used,0
"T-Mobile has deceptive trade practices, fraudulent ads and guarantees which they do not honor, and their websites and customer service agents lie.I thought you folks would be interested in the recent experience I had with T-Mobile.Having spotty cell service with our current cell carrier, I was looking at competitive services on my smartphone on April 6 and I came across T-Mobile. Their pricing is quite competitive. I then came across a feature on their phone accessed web site that pushed me to try them.The Go Back Guarantee: On the phone version of their website, they had a large ad, “You'll love it here, guaranteed. With our new $50 Go Back Guarantee, if you're not satisfied within 30 days, you can switch back to your old carrier and get $50 for every voice line. Via virtual prepaid Master card. Allow 5 weeks for card. Get full terms (hyperlink)”The Go Back Guarantee Full Terms: “You'll love it here, guaranteed. Contact us before cancelling or porting out line(s) to request payout. Limited time offer; subject to change. Port-in voice line from postpaid plan w/ eligible carrier (i.e., AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum, Claro, Liberty, Xfinity or US Cellular), and port-out to eligible carrier within 30 days of T-Mobile line activation required. Account must be in good standing (e.g., final bill paid) to receive virtual prepaid MasterCard (no cash access & expires in 6 months). Up to 12/account. One offer per subscriber. Not available for customers that cancelled T-Mobile service within the past 90 days. Card is issued by Sunrise Banks N.A., Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Mastercard(sic) International Incorporated. Use of this card constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions stated in the Cardholder Agreement.”I showed my wife and her sister this guarantee and they agreed it was worth a try.I went to their store on April 7 and got their service.By April 11, it was evident T-Mobile wasn't working for us.I went to the store who told me to contact Customer Care by phone.The Customer Care agent eventually handed me over to a supervisor who repeated what the CC agent was telling me, “This guarantee promotion didn't start until today (April 11) and cannot be honored for service purchased prior.” The supervisor claimed he didn't see the Go Back Guarantee on the website even though I told him where it was within the web site to see it, but he claimed he didn't see it.  He said T-Mobile could not honor the guarantee.  Per the guarantee, I had yet to cancel T-Mobile, nor had I started service with another carrier.Since then, the guarantee has been removed from the desktop website, though it still exists on the phone website.  Regardless, T-Mobile refuses to back up the advertised guarantee.Per T-Mobile's advertised guarantee, they owe me $100 (for two lines), a guarantee they refuse to honor.How many others have had the 'promotion' not start until AFTER their service has started???",0
"Was Paid ahead when I switched to Mint mobile. I still had at least 15 days left when I cancelled T-Mobile. I just figured that money was my loss. Cancelled the middle of March Then I received 2 bills on the same day, one dated April 5th for $41.44 and one dated April 10th for $13.82. The second one had a $7.00 late fee as part of it. Called them and the guy was supposed to call me back within 2 days. Never happened. I just called them back. I got nowhere. anyway, I paid the $13.82 and told her I need to get off of the phone and go leave a bad review. They don't like that. Then she was going to give me the $7.00 late fee back but she found out she cant do that on an account that was cancelled. Anyway do what you will but I don't recommend them.",0
Customer service was very rude. The conversation went in circles.  The conversation was so rude. I asked for a recording of the conversation and was denied access to it.  But it was mention at the beginning of the phone call that it was recorded for different purposes.  Well I would like to turn this conversation over to the CEO of T-Mobile my phone call was not handled properly and if something isn't done about. I'm taking my actions to someone else.,0
"Please do not move to T Mobil. They are the worse phone company in the world. It was a big mistake moving with them 2 years ago. I will never make the same mistake again. So please do yourself a favor, and not to stress yourself. Customer service suck and they are good in telling you lies. T Mobil they are the worse carriers.",0
"When I send emails from my cell phone, sometimes with their service, it shows they went through, but people never received them.   Also, if you are ever going into a physical store, you can’t believe anything that comes out of one of their sales reps mouth.  They have a general idea about things, but no clue as to how things actually work; as was the case when I signed up for their free Wi-Fi on domestic flights and free Netflix plan. Everything the rep told me was completely wrong. That, of course, could impact your buying decision when you’re being given misleading information.",0
"I have purchased two Iphones and one Samsung phone in the past 4 years from T-mobible and just added a second line.  A month later I get this email:ACTION NEEDED by 05/08/2024.

To continue receiving the $10.00 AutoPay discount, you must update your payment method to a debit card or a bank account.Visit your T-Mobile account to update your payment method and keep your discount by 05/08/2024.I call 611 and get customer service that is pathetic.

"I have had t mobile internet for about 9 months. I have not had internet for 5 days.  I was told to go to my nearest store which is in Sturgis , Michigan to pick up a new Sim card . Well that didn't solve the problem , so now I'm back at the store & these two guys working are thee worst employees at any store I've ever  been in  . Completely rude ! Told me the tech guy who sent me to the store to get a new modem doesn't know what he's talking about . How I should never have been directed to go to the store & ask for help. They are so rude because I didn't have my receipt from  10 months ago they won't can't help me . I got the service originally from this store so why can't they just look my name up? Why did they kick me out of their store without helping me . Completely ridiculous.  I will never be a customer of tmobilr again & I'm telling everyone I know how awful t mobile employees are !",0
I tried to sign up with T-Mobile and their website is glitchy and their sales reps aren't helpful at all. Horrible first impression.,0

"Lousy phone company when they get you as a customer what they do is rob you for a garbage service, bad signal, bad data and lousy attention, over costs in the bills that even they do not know how to explain.

TMobile is childish and unprofessional I had to call several times because reps would sit in the phone and laugh not just that T-Mobile is the reason my Info is on the dark web I don't recommend doing business with this company they're bs,0
"I signed up for service online and ordered a phone. My daughter decided to put me on her service, family plan since it would be easier on me since I'm on disability and have limited income. I called T-Mobile to cancel and they said that since I haven't received the phone yet when the driver arrives with it, to refuse the phone and they will cancel the service, no problem. That is what I did. I received a bill in the mail for almost $200! I called them and my daughter called them. They said to go to the store in Evansville, IN to tell them and they would handle it. I went to the store and they said to talk to the corporate office about it! I made two payments with two checks, in two months. In the amount owed. Now they sent me another bill saying that I hadn't paid the last bill for $71.58 and now I owe them an additional $7! I have a canceled check that proves I paid. I guess I will have to get the BBB involved. My advice is always to pay by check so you can rub it in their faces that you paid them! And keep your receipts for at least three years in case they try to take you to court for nonpayment. I have so many businesses to do that because if they can get you to pay twice to recover losses in other areas, they will. Do not use T-Mobile. Their customer service is non-existent and they use people that have a thick foreign accent that you can't understand them. When you ask them to speak slower, they ignore you. I plan on looking long and hard for a new service, but from the other reviews on here about other carriers, it's very depressing. And yes, they need to redo the stars to have a ""no star"" option on here.",0
"I scheduled a payment arrangement for $195. The payment didn’t go through from my Navy Federal account so I paid $195 from a different account. What I didn’t know is even though I paid , they tried a second time to take the payment out of Navy Federal and it went through. So making it a total of $390 within 3 days. After calling customer support to ask for 1 payment to be returned, they said they couldn’t do it because there was a balance on my account. I’m so angry because they know this is not right! So they are keeping the extra $195 and they don’t give a crap about my bank account being in the negative because of them resubmitting a payment that I already took care of…. Shame on you T-Mobile!!! But again they don’t give a Crap about their own customers!!",0

"I would give T-Mobile negative stars. I return the equipment within a week to remain with current provider. I received email they received the equipment back. They kept charging my bank card for a service I never used for equipment I don’t have. I ended up calling them to cancel everything. They charge my bank card again. The problem is I ended up stopping my card. They couldn’t pull money out of my account. Now, they have collection agency after me. I called them and was lied to. The guy was disrespectful on the phone.",0

"Been with them for 3 years.  Have been treated like trash.  I broke my phone, got a revvl 6x pro 5g which is junk.  Had it less than 12 hours went to get different phone which customer service told me I could do.  However, the store rep wanted me to reshelf it for $100.  Phone only cost 189 to 229.  No one informed me of reshelving fees.  So I am stuck with a phone no blue tooth for zoom calls which I have to have for doctors, disconnects calls, overheats, doesn't charge until after 4 hours, drops calls and the speaker doesn't work.  I get to keep this piece of crap for 2 years.  I submitted this section on April 9, 2024Here's a little update as of April 11, 2024. I was informed to stop calling customer service on this issue so they screwed me over on this phone they have no intention of calling me back and making it right please stay away from T-Mobile.",0

"I was a Tmobile Customer almost 25 years, never late or missed a payment. Decided to go to Xfinity Mobile for a better dream.Tmobile was all nice, told me if I wanted to come back they would save my no for me!  Then in about a month I get a 480.00 bill and I am 68 years old, fixed income, and it tore my nerves up bad! I called Tmobile thinking there was a computer glitch! They informed me that about 15 years ago I had got a thing call boost device and that I had to bring it in or they were going to charge me 480.00. I didn’t even know what they were speaking of, still don’t. I said why if I owed you anything would you wait 15 plus years to tell me, they said it was because I switched to another company! I have no idea what they are talking about, I have lost two sons and a husband in that 15 years. I am so upset with a company that as a realtor I promoted , didn’t get very good service , especially outside of town but I stuck with them and this is the thanks I get! I feel if I owed them for something they should have told me 15 years ago or longer.But to say I owe them fo a booster I never heard of it and I feel so betrayed by a company I stood by for 25 years! Dont have 480.00! to pay them , am mad and broken heated to be treated in such a way! I would have maybe went back to Tmobile, but as far as I am concerned I would use a tin can to communicate, at least it wouldn’t slap me in the face and treat me like Tmobile has!  The date of my experience started in around 2005 and ended in March 2024.",0
"If I could give negative stars I would. I canceled my services with this company over six months ago, I paid a full month of service that they did NOT provide, returned all the equipment and now, SEVEN months later I received a bill for a past due amount of $21. They will never stop billing me for stupid reasons. How can I have a past due bill from an account that does not exist? Stay away from Tmobile!!! They are the most terrible company to get services from. I left because of all the problems with billing, connection, you name it. Worst experience ever 😡",0
Wrong people to have service with. They abuse the options to make their time spent just for money not quality or better reviews my experience was bad refurbished devices has defective calibration and issues the service is bad not helpful to customer than lead to paying after ignoredNot worth to keep yes pay to get yourself away from their contact they are sick bad.,0

Well let’s start with the fact that I’ve had T-Mobile for quite sometime and yet they decided to screw me over with international calls. I went overseas for work for 2 months. My phone was on WiFi calling I made sure and this isn’t my first time overseas doing this. They told me I had $434 charges in international calls and I argued with them but unfortunately they sent it to collections. So my advice to anyone is to steer clear of Tmobile and as a veteran I do not recommend them. Money hungry companies like this need to be shut down and they need to be held accountable for destroying peoples credit. Funny how phone companies don’t boost your credit yet they can destroy your credit… Seems fair.,0

I was  extremely upset with T-Mobile.  This is the second issue I had with T-Mobile, their system was compromised and my Identity was stolen.  It's been a nightmare with this phone carrier.",0
"They have by far the WORST cell service in the country I have to drive 3 miles from my house to get one bar to be able to call someone, it’s absolutely ridiculous. I randomly lose cell service all the time even while in town. Verizon was 10x better than this garbage!",0
"I dealt with Kevin and Demetrious at the Monroe/Talmadge location in Toledo, OH.  My 16-year-old son signed up for a phone using the T-Mobile app without parental consent.  He did not lie about his age, even used his driver’s license and social security card.  Demetrious wouldn't even listen to me, instead immediately insinuated my son lied about his age, which bothered me and when I said I didn't want to pay the $70 restock fee, he said ""ok we're done here"" and slid the phone across the table.  I had not raised my voice and was nothing but respectful.Then I tried to tell him he didn't know what he was talking about because my son used his real age - and Demetrious started lecturing me on how he has a bachelor’s and master’s degree.  Demetrious then left the conversation, and for the whole time we were there waiting for them to cancel the line (after I paid the fee) Demetrious would not even look at me or acknowledge me.  I have no idea what T-Mobile is teaching their managers, but Demetrious immediately escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it.I also dealt with Kevin, whom I asked, ""have you ever heard the term 'the customer is always right?'""  He said, ""we both know that's not true.""  Wow.  I will never do business with T-Mobile anywhere, and the company should be ashamed of how their employees treat customers.  But hey, Demetrious has a master’s degree y'all.  He knows better than all of us.",0

"I wish I could give -5 stars. Unbelievably unethical behavior.Here's my story- I left them for Verizon. When I closed my account they said that we were all settled up and there were no other charges.- 9 months later, I get a credit report alert that they created a new charge and sent it to collections. No phone call, text, or email as a warning.- I call them, after 4 hours they agree that they would honor the promise originally made (that there would be no further charges) and would remove the charge. I think that's the end of it- One year later, I get another credit alert. They didn't remove the charge, they just sat on it it- Call them up, they accuse me of lying that this previous exchange ever happened (even though I read them the notes I made during the call from the incident) and insist that the charge is valid- I agree to pay the ransom to make the problem finally go away ($241)Stay away",0

T Mobile has poor customer service for everything you have to call them 100 times,0
"We started our service online then had to call customer service and they sent the phones through fed ex. From the time we received the phones they never got service. I could call 611 to get to customer if I was in one spot in a driveway. 2 days of being on phone with customer service they said we had to take the phones to a T-Mobile store 21 miles away to return them since our service wouldn't work in our area. We did that they charged our bank $4 and something and now 2 weeks later charged our bank $100 for a months service. We never even had service the two plus days we had the phones. I called and they put in a request to credit it back and she said the request is pending. Then I get a letter in the mail that our bill is over due for $100. I called my bank and they said they couldn't stop the payment but if they did it again I could stop payment on another and it would cost me $35. BEWARE of T-Mobile, never again if we move again will I try them or recommend them. It cost $140 to try them out and be without phone service for 3 days. One mad customer when we live in limited social security retirement.Update: they took another $15 out of our account, I guess $100 wasn’t good enough for 2 or 3 days of no service 😡",0
"This company is HORRIBLE. Practically STOLE money from me and my family.  I was using t-mobile for over 10 years and was a loyal customer. Never missed 1 payment. However, they would do some sketchy things with my bill that had Me question the company’s credibility over the last few years I was with them.Initially, I wouldn’t check my bill statements and this was a mistake because T-Mobile would charge me for things that I never used or purchased. When I would call customer service, they would lie and say I did purchase (a plan, an equipment etc), but I know that I never had purchased anything additional.   When I would ask them to remove those things, they would confirm over the phone verbally that they would be removed from my plan- months would go by, they would remove it initially and then it will be added on again.  I was the sole authorized user on my account and so no one else had access to make any changes to my plans.After a few years of dealing with this, and having to stay with T-Mobile because I was under a phone contract for two years, I finally decided to leave. However, when I left, guess what happened?They charged me for an additional month, AFTER, I left because I had left my card on file before closing my account. When I transferred my number to another company T-Mobile automatically removed my access to all of my files, to my online account - everything, so I could not remove any of my personal information since they took my account away!  So, I tried disputing the charge and they gave me an excuse that they had to charge me because I never paid the first month of service… what?  Whatever, I couldn’t get my money back….. But then, two months later, they sent me another bill saying I owed an equipment I never returned from back in 2016. I was STUNNED!  I never purchased the equipment they said I had purchased in-store, I also never saw this “charge” on ANY of my bills throughout my time with the company.I was so certain I was done with T-Mobile and then they send me to collections ??I had done EVERYTHING to avoid this prior to leaving. I went to the store, closed my account, received verbal and physical confirmation that everything was paid for and I received the last three month invoices to confirm it. Yet they still found a way to send me to collections for something I have no record or recollection of?  How the hell do they get away with this fraudulent behavior?  I’m not the only person I know that they have done this with. I am so upset!  I will never use T-Mobile again!! I will never recommend them to anyone.   They’re over priced, and they are fraudulent!! Once you’re ready to leave them, that’s when they want to make things even worse for you financially.Don’t ever use T-Mobile!! Mint Mobile has been amazing for me.  I live in NYC and it works JUST like, if not better than T-Mobile service. I pay 35$ a month and I have no unexpected fees.Now time for me to fight with collections over this T-Mobile bill …. Wish me luck.(Written by Rafael B.)",0
"In short, when I tried to add cell phones to the 5G internet service I had set up the day before, they set up a new account that was linked to the interim cell phone numbers, instead of the email address I had linked to the account the day before (I did not know I had two accounts).  I had autopay set up for the first account, which was apparently not being used. They started charging for the two phone lines before they were even able to be set up, with all of the necessary transfer actions.  They shut down my home internet service for lack of payment, even though I was paying on the first account, so I had to pay $270 to reactivate it (while I was in two online meetings needed for income) without a bill to know what I was paying for.  Subsequently, the necessary items were complete to transfer the cell phones and the only thing T-mobile was able to do was render the cell phones as bricks and make it so that they didn't work at all.  After spending over 10 hours on the phone with them, they started telling me I had to wait 24 hours for provisioning to occur, 18 hours after we first  started to try the transfer.  Ultimately, my wife needed functional phones, so then I switched to verizon.  Even though the only function T-mobile served was to kill my wife's phones, they will not refund the $160 for the cell phone services that they were not able to activate, the late fee for payment of a bill that was only sent to a nonexistent phone number, or the reactivation fee.  So they want me to pay for a service that they couldn't provide solely because I signed up for it.  I have now paid $330 to T-mobile for a partial month of a $60 service, with no recourse.  Unfortunately, at the moment, T-mobile is the only viable home internet service in the area other than Starlink.",0

I was planning on going on the 55+ plan but changed my mind. I called T-Mobile asked if I should mail the sim cards they sent me back. They told me to destroy them. They proceeded to charge me for 3 months even though I never activated a phone through them. They said since I never closed the account they could charge me whether I had phone service or not. The 55+ plan was supposed to be $55 a month. T-Mobile charged me $76.20 a month for 3 months on a credit card I used to get the Sim Cards. I would advise anyone thinking of doing business with T-Mobile avoid them like the plague.,0
"Customer service is garbage. When you were on the phone for an hour and a half and they do absolutely nothing to resolve your issue and you find out that they had signed you up for a plan on your eight-year-old iPad. That’s for $34.99 that has international calling and things that she will never use instead of the service that has more data Without all the extra features for $15… I still have no service at home on any of my devices and the customer service representative after an hour and a half who did nothing, hung up on me. She told me to go to the store and get new Sims cards for all of my devices. Now make that makes sense. I told her no that they would tell me to call her and she hung up..",0
"For context, I'm currently stationed in northern Japan. Back in mid Dec 2023, all T mobile users here suffered a service outage. I called tech support and they acknowledged that there was a tower issue and they are working to resolve it. Approximately 3 weeks go by and I finally have my data back. I called customer support to discuss the possibility of getting some kind of credit since I went 3 weeks to both of my lines without any service. First she offered $50. I told her that I didn't think it was a fair compensation on a $142 bill so she agreed and offered to cover the full amount. A week goes by and no adjustment, I contacted them again and they reassured that it was being worked. A few more weeks goes by and no adjustment. I made contact again and they now tell me a person named Ronalyn had to review and approve the credit. More time goes by and I sent another message asking for Ronalyn and all they could do is send her a message asking her to give me a call back. In the meantime they credited me $20 two times for a total of $40 saying that was all they were allowed to credit me for. I called one last time in mid March 2024 and the lady I spoke had her management team review all the chat history for the last 3 months. She acknowledged about the promise of the credit however stated that it was a FALSE promise. No one on her team not even her managers could help me and that the only thing she can do is put in another message to Ronalyn from the San Anotonio dept to give me a call but even then she could promise me that she would call. 3 and half months since this issue and still not resolved. $40 credit on a $142.11 bill  when I had no service at all for 3 out of the 4 weeks, is that fair compensation? I will state that when I was with Sprint I never had issues. Tmobile has absolutely been Horrible!",0

"I was a loyal customer for 14 years who ported my line last month.  Prior to porting, I called to ask if the fees would be prorated or would I be billed for a full month regardless of the date.  The young lady confirmed it would be prorated and a refund would be issued.  Not only was the fees not reimbursed, they were also trying to charge me additional fees.I asked to speak to a supervisor to explain my concerns and Mark, the supervisor, was not only unpleasant but rude.  He stated it was company ""standard"" rules to keep the entire payment regardless of the port date.  As I continued to explain what was communicated to me, he put me on mute and returned only to repeat ""company standard rules"" and to let me know his decision was final.I asked the name of rep who transferred me to which he replied he could not give out anyone's name nor could he refund any monies.Not only was he rude, he hung up in my face.This company cares NOTHING about people.

"We switched back from Verizon and it was the worst choice.

At this point, a little extra money on Verizon is worth it considering we pay 230 dollars a month for our phones not to work.Also annoyed that one reason we did switch was ""Netflix on us"" with no ads. To get an email that oh we're going to ad supported because we're also giving you Hulu... on exactly one plan you get Hulu, so now we're paying 8 extra dollars a month plus 30 for a 3rd line we were told was free when joining, only to be told that oh you're on a military plan so that doesn't apply, even though we were clear from the beginning that it was a military plan and told it would be free.Overall a huge mess and the superior customer service isn't enough to keep us anymore.",0

"I was disconnected three times before being able to complete my support request with a T-Mobile representative. I inquired about an additional T-Mobile line of service for a new SyncUp Tracker. I told the representative I was calling to find out what promotions were available. The representative said if I ordered a new line of service, I would receive a new SyncUp Tracker for free. She specifically and unequivocally assured me the device would not be part of any T-Mobile financing agreement. She asked for my credit card to pay the sales tax charge. I provided her with my credit card information. The T-Mobile agent said she would email me an e-signature to sign so she could ship out the device. When the e-signature form arrived, it carried a 24-month finance agreement. I was extremely suspicious and asked the representative to explain. The representative told me, in no uncertain terms, not to worry about it. The representative said the e-signature form was the only form T-Mobile had at the time. The T-Mobile agent said that once the device shipped, the agreement would be cancelled, and I would receive the device for free, without any financing and without having to stay with T-Mobile for 24 months. I signed the agreement, knowing I had the buyer's remorse period as protection. The agent gave me her personal guarantee that I would get a free tracker without the financing agreement. After my phone with the T-Mobile agent, I called T-Mobile and spoke with several representatives as well as a billing supervisor. Each T-Mobile representative said I entered into a financing agreement. None of the subsequent agents or supervisors I spoke with about this incident cared about the fact that a T-Mobile agent had defrauded me. All anyone from T-Mobile had to do was listen to the recorded conversation I had with the dishonorable T-Mobile agent, and it would be clear that the agent deliberately lied to me.I made multiple requests to have the representative I spoke with call me back. I never received a call.",0

"I reached out to T-Mobile for a warranty exchange! They sent me a warranty device to a store! Went to the store The store would not take my device as a warranty! This happened to me three times!

The first warranty device they sent me arrived with a cracked screen! I then had to send it back! Now I've been charged an extra $50 on my bill.

This can’t be legal. They flat out lied about providing a service for a price then changed the price. Scamming company that should be sued til its doors close. Hate this company with a passion.,0
"So back in February I saw AT&T had a special on Samsung S24 Ultra AI phone. The phone with trade in was about 150 for a 1400 phone. So I thought I would do it using my old Note 10+ as a trade in. So got the phone and went into AT&T to have it set up and the Manager says our bad you’re not on the right rate plan if we move you to it the extra cost is 30 a month and the now 14 a month on the phone. I said nope cancel it I will go to T-Mobile for their deal on the same phone.So got all cancelled and was refunded for fees I paid up front to AT&T.I then went to T-Mobile and their deal was a little better on Samsung S24 Ultra AI phone. They required no trade in and would pay AT&T off 179 and give me 800 off the phone and 400 in credits which made the phone free except for taxes and fees which they all have. The guy said they will send an edoc to sign then all is a go. They sent the doc, I e-signed and T-Mobile sent a confirmation email acknowledging I signed. Then crickets for 5 days.Called T-Mobile CS they said oh that order was cancelled because edocs were not signed. I said wait I signed them and here is the confirmation email from T-Mobile confirming that. They said Opps our bad must have been a system error. So, I had to go back to T-Mobile office and redo the order this time signing the edoc in front of the agent. He set up delivery to my house because the one I wanted Titanium Grey was not in stock and the closest store that had it was 60 miles away. Then the UPS issue starts.So, UPS arranged delivery after 5 pm however they came at 9 am, so I rescheduled for 2-5pm the next day and they came at 9 am. I called UPS they said well the driver can change route to save fuel. I said but wait customers don’t know the driver is coming 5 or 6 hours ahead of a scheduled time. Her response Sorry, they will come Friday I said but no one will be there her response then they will send it back to T-Mobile. In the process UPS mishandled the phone and did not return it to T-Mobile.So now third trip to T-Mobile again everything cancelled, and order reconstructed. Only this time I had it sent to work a warehouse where people do receiving all day and UPS is their main shipper. So, Tuesday 3/5/2024 I get confirmation package delivered at dock at 9:37 am. Went down to dock and no package. They said the auto sign has been happening since covid and driver still does it. The warehouse Manager said sometimes they do this then deliver it the next day. I called UPS they said dispatch would call within an hour, no call. So, I called again 2 hours later and again they said dispatch would call within an hour, however no call.Wednesday 3/6/2024 still no package and no one can find it. Filed a claim with T-Mobile and UPS. Then dispatch called to get the information on the lost delivery.Now T-Mobile billed me for a month of service on 2/27/2024 which even if I received the phone on the 2nd week remember they cancelled I would be getting billed a month for 2 weeks usage.They have also not given me credit for the first charge for taxes and turnup of a phone I never received.Now they will have to refund the second charge for taxes and turnup of the second phone I never received.So I received a refund for the 110 usage bill for never using their service I guess it was for the privilege, never the less it was refunded.Then on 3/15/2024 I finally received a refund on the first phone order but still waiting on the second.I called on 3/20/2024 and got the run around from two off shore agents requested over and over a supervisor or on shore customer service then the rep (Al) disconnected the call while I was on hold for a supervisor, right!I called back another rep advised me the claim with T-Mobile was for the first phone no one had opened anything on the second phone. So now I must wait another 7 days for that claim.She asked if I wanted to close account, I said hell yes but not until I get my refund.I thought AT&T had bad CS until I dealt with T-Mobile, T-Mobile is the champion of bad CS.",0
"Customer service is lacking! I had a surgery, out of work on bedrest for a month. Called to explain to them why my first bill was unpaid. They asked for my bank card to set up a future payment arrangement, but their system doesn’t accept prepaid bank cards. I pay all my bills with my debit card. The next morning they disconnected my service. I will be returning their equipment and will advocate to everyone I meet to not waste their money on such a heartless company. Better off sticking with Verizon, at least they have a heart.",0
"Don’t waste your time with this company worst company ever. Save your self all the stress and get fios don’t use Tmobile internet you can be in the best standing, automated payment and this company will sneak over 288. Payments in on a 50 dollar bill. Or tell you they can’t help you because you don’t have a Tmobile phone. Or say well you should have taken it off automatic payments then or you can call your bank and tell them. Never missed a payment never been late. But this company steals money when they can. Which they don’t even give a reason at all or tell you why. Best thing I did was switch I haven’t had an issue or an interruption since I switched. Haven’t had any hidden fees of 288. Dollars or 105. And so on. Let’s not forget how they mocked me when I called and asked for a manager purposely calling me a different names. If they had a zero it would be a zero.",0
"I tried the home internet for 1 day. Returned the device and was charged for the monthly payment. No one can tell me why since the account was deactivated. I called and spoke to 4 representatives, went to 2 stores, didn't get any help there either, and then they don't want to refund me my money. Extremely dissemination and dissatisfied all the way stove. The home internet ducked sucked.",0
"I got a internet service  from T mobile. Had it one day and then returned it with the labels they send me though a email for ups, 2 months later they are billing me 252.00 cause they think they dont have it, but they cant tell awfull  to deal with , plus 2 months they turn me into a credit collection,  and i owe them nothing , disgusting !!",0
"I was a very happy Sprint customer for almost 15 years. Their cellular service was great and their customer service was always outstanding. I was afraid of what would happen when T-Mobile was allowed to purchase Sprint, as I had heard T-Mobile's customer service was nowhere near as good as Sprint. My fears were realized when my family split our accounts when they qualified for a cheaper plan due to their age. I made THREE attempts after the split to change my plan to save myself $40/month, and the first two times each representative said they had changed the plan and still I was charged $110 for a single line. By the 3rd time, I was understandably upset and the customer service representative tried to argue with me about WHEN the change was made to my account. After 10 minutes of this, I told her to forget it and that I was changing services. I am extremely disappointed and angry at the $80 they managed to 'steal' from me over the last 2 months. I do NOT recommend T-Mobile...EVER. Score: F",0
"I am a disabled Veteran and have TMobile service for approximately 15 months.  Since my paydays are different every month, my payments are late sometimes.  As a result of this, they have consistently suspended my services every month for the past 6 months.  I have recently tried to get them to give me a couple extra days to make a payment and keep my service on, but they will not.",0
"This is the absolute worst cell service I have ever had. I’m counting down the days to finish my contract so I can leave. I’ve complained multiple times about dropped calls and lack of service and that even in my own home I only have service half the time, I’m always dismissed with “oh, it’s because you have an iPhone.” And never fix anything. Would highly suggest you never switch to this provider.",0
"After 6 years of giving them an opportunity they turned out to be liers and a company that try to make their customers pay for their wrong doing.  Exchanged 2 phones under warranty and insurance and even a third party UPS confirmed it. They kept telling me they would take care of it on their end without interrupting my business for months and not do business like others after confirming the phones receipt (oddly they don't record it on their end, and UPS confirmed delivery) to fix their error trying to charge me over $2,100 for phones that where insured, paid and received, they disconnected/interrupting my services/business and excused this service where I had to call in for months and they would give their confirmation this would not happen, interrupting my time, business and ultimately having a serious negative impact.  Most of the time I traveled all over the US for work as this is a business line, I would often go without service.",0
"I would give zero stars if I could. I had a business account with this company. While on phone with customers, the phone would drop calls. It became so frustrating that I ported my number to Verizon on 8/8/2023. By the way, I have not had any issues with Verizon. Any who, on September 23, I contacted T-Mobile because I received an unexpected phone bill. The representative stated that there were additional lines that were not ported. I was unaware of these lines because there wasn’t a SIM card or a phone for the lines in question. I asked that the account be canceled on 9/23. The representative stated that they would have to complete an investigation and someone would call me. Unfortunately, that never happened. On October 24th., I called T-Mobile because I received another bill that had accumulated additional charges. This issue was still not resolved due to their incompetent associates. On November 23rd, I contacted T-Mobile again to address the accumulated charges because I was billed on a phone that was not used for the months of August, September, October, and November. The line was finally disconnected in November due to nonpayment. When I spoke to a representative to inquire about the charges and who was responsible. He stated that the system noted a “future cancellation” I had to record this for my documentation. I did not ask for a future cancellation. I asked that the lines be canceled as of 9/23.Now, the bill has went to collections with inaccurate data. Not only has T-Mobile incompetency ruined my business credit it has also forced me to pay an inaccurate bill which has been paid in full. If you’re considering T-Mobile as your phone carrier…. RUN!!!!!! pay a little more to have a peace of mind, exceptional customer service, and a technical/help support team.I’ve been contacting T-Mobile since September it is NOW March and this issue has not been resolved. T-Mobile you can’t go around robbing customers without a gun. I’ve been a loyal customer for many years however, I’d never ever recommend your services nor will T-Mobile ever be my phone carrier again!",0
"I am so thoroughly disappointed in T-Mobile right now. I used to be a proud T-Mobile customer and have even referred people to them in the past, but my experiences with them of late have been downright inane.I've paid the same balance with them three times: they didn't apply my first payment (even though it showed up in my bank account) so they sent me to collections; when I tried clear up the issue, I ended up paying the amount again. Then T-Mobile sent me to collections AGAIN and when I tried to prove once more that this was paid, the debt collector sided with T-Mobile and I ended up paying again.NOW, T-Mobile has sent me to a debt collector for the same balance AGAIN! And because I don't have my six digit code (on an account that's been closed for two years) T-Mobile can't help me over the phone. So, to get this thing cleared up AGAIN I have to go into a store - where the wait can be anywhere up to an hour or more - in order to get this thing resolved. I am not paying this for a fourth time and it irritates me that this keeps happening.I will not be referring people to T-Mobile anymore nor will I be a customer of theirs again.",0
"Today March 15,2024  (1:00 pm ) I visit with my daughter the  T-Mobile location located beside Walmart on Madison St in Clarksville TN (new store). When we go inside the location no customers and 3 employees sitting look out there phones. We don’t receive any greetings and no employees names. My daughter was interesting in a few lines for herself and family but the feedback and info was horrible. This guy ( long hair white young with no name) was no professional and he don’t have the purpose to sell phones or give any information to customers. The service was awful and bad. We going to another company that treat us with good customer service and good options or plans with our needs. That kind of service in unacceptable and I don’t understand this company hire employees like this.",0
"Awful service in geral it is not 1 star is 0 stars.I am Portuguese from Portugal but due to my work I was living in the USA, I decided to buy an iPhone and since I could do it by finance I decided to buy it in T-mobile I always pay everything on time by almost the end I came to Portugal I still owed three hundred and something dollars to finish the whole thing so I decided to pay the whole thing and close the account because in Portugal I am not going to use a t-mobile card I am using a Portuguese card I should mention I pay more for my phone to be unlock so I can use any mobile service. So I pay the rest and try to use a Portuguese card and it doesn’t work the phone is not unlock so I contact T-Mobile cuz they can fix this online. Well no help they say they can find my process it is like the account never existed I explain that I close it that I am overseas. They never find it, I don’t wanna deal with them anymore so I just pay to get my phone unlock, 60 euros.They by the end cant finish the process to unlock my phone because T- mobile says that I owe 668 $. And I don’t, probably the new owner of the card owes that.And when I try to ask for help the excuse is always that they can’t find my account.So right now I have a iPhone 13 Pro Max that I can’t use because is blocked.",0
The worst costumer service. After 17 years I am changing provider. T Mobile lies and charge so much more. The worst ever!!!,0
"If I could review T mobile, I would give them -10. They have very, very terrible service, and for almost two years, they have promised to fix the problem that they promised to us, but when you talk to them, they start over and again and promise and promise, and nothing happens. So for those wanting to find a good service, think about getting t-mobile so that you will headaches what we have experienced.",0
"They really don’t deserve any stars because they will continue to raise your bill each month and then when you leave them they will charge you ridiculous fees on your final bill that just continues to grow higher! Was on the phone for an hour trying to resolve the final bill and they would not even try to work it out so I just didn’t pay anything and will go to court and tell how they ripping customers off. Make a wise decision and don’t give them your business. There service sucks, AT&T service and coverage is much better!!!",0
Extremely rude customer service. I was forced to go to them after being with sprint for ten years and they merged to T-Mobile. They won’t work with you at all. My bill is always way higher than it’s supposed to be and what it was agreed upon. My bill goes up hundreds of dollars randomly. Awful company. I’m looking into changing asap.,0
"These guys are just charging late fees. There is no good connection anywhere.  From when they have taken over The supervisor Andrew operating as he said from Oregon should not be put in front of clientsHe should be given a salary and a desk jobHe is  hostile, not concerned about customer relations at all",0
"Hello my name is Kenneth . I have been a customer for 11yrs. Since October of 2023 I have been having a problem with Assurant and the Tmobile Customer Service. I have been lied to on numerous time. I originally purchased a Samsung S20fe from the store in Woodbridge, VA. The phone has been exchanged out several time. The software had issues (ContinouslyBuffing), screen blacked out, and  when finally came around to the fifth time. The store ordered an replacement.  Got a text from Assurant  that the phone was on backorder and dont know when they would have one . I called and talked to your customer service about the issue. The representative told me to go to the store and get a replacement for free. Also, to give them the Samsung S20fe that had issues.I got the Samsung S23+ for my mother. I drove 150 miles to get the transaction done sine i work in Delaware and it was my day off. I paid the activation fee and was there for 4hours in the store. I was under the understanding that they were I was gonna owe $279 for new phone and accessories. Now told that the phone was $900 plus and they tried to add a new line on my account without my authorization. This transaction was noted on the account. Plus, that replacement never arrived.Now let's get to the New phone I bought in Newark,  DE. I bought this phone in November of 2023 while I was getting my car worked on. I had been waiting awhile to get a new one. So while I had time to burn as the car was getting worked on at the dealership. I paid the activation fee and get the accessories to protect the phone.was happy to get my new phone of Samsung Ultra 23.  On December 21. The phone fell when getting out my work truck. The Otterbox case cracked the back of phone and it shut off. I went back to the store and see what could be done. I had the phone for 21 days. They told me they couldn't help me and I had to go through Assurant. Funny thing is I'm 150 miles home from and my mother was having surgery on December 26, 2023. I got to a computer to start the claim and then it got complicated.  I texted the representative Chad K. He told I could go to Christiana Mall to get get replaced. Got up early  on December 22, 2023 and was at the mall at by 10:30am. They told me they couldn't help me. So, they let me use there phone in the store to start the claim. When it got to the payment status of the claim they hung up on me. I called the Customer Service at T-mobile to get them involved. I know Christmas was on December 25th and the phone wasn't gonna arrive until December 26th. I told them I wasn't gonna be home to receive it and gave them the address of the store in Newark, DE. When I went to pick the phone up @ 5:30pm. I was told that they couldn't accept the phone and sent it back to Assurant.  I called Usps and Assurant to see who had the phone. No one knew. I called Tmobile back and told them I needed the phone tonight or tomorrow December 27th for work. Assurant ad Tmobile promised the phone work arrive on that day. Long be hold it didn't arrive and more excuses were made. I was told by the representative to get another phone and I would have to pay for the old one.  The replacement didnt arrive until December 31, 2023 from Fedex. A neighbor found the package sitting outside and picked it up. I called several times after that with problems. They tried to add another number. To be frank and the point.  I was being billed for 4 lines and 4 protection plans. I have been fighting this matter since then. Tonight I went the store to get them to send the phone back to Assurant as told by the representative.  On January 21,Christina said, they would ship it back to them. The Store Representative open the bag and found that the phone was to be sent back Usps. The phone was never used and still in the security tape. Now, I was told by you Tmobile representative that you want me to pay for the old phone along with the new one. I understand one, but 2 no way.",0
"T-Mobile has no competent person to contact if you have any problems with billing (lots) and their changes to business plans.The local T-Mobile offices are not allowed to handle billing/plan changes by TM only the “61” number in the Philippines.You can’t understand the “61” staff and they don’t understand English and our bills keep on going up and up.Our monthly plan should have been about $150 month but because of “61” it is now $344.On of the ladies in our Tempe TM office has a black eye from an irate customer over continued months of excess charges.We finally had to cancel because no one in the USA can help us.We began service with Verizon 1-29-24 for $150.Verizon told us T-Mobile can’t continue billing us after their service was discontinued 1-29-24 but TM did.We received a FINAL Bill in January 2024, which we paid, but new bills keep arriving incl 3-8-24.If T-Mobile just paid their staff a decent wage, the managers could handle billing and plan complaints.The Philippine people are probably paid $2 an hour so they are  angry and revengeful.Just take a fraction on the millions spent in advertising and compensate your American workers to handle disputes.There are over 8 websites with negative reviews regarding T-Mobile  incl the Better Business Bureau.Praying BBB will help us because our only option is to stop paying them and wreck our perfect credit.",0
"Cut the cord and went with T-Mobile wireless in the home. Turns out they use ip address that do not show actual location.   Subscriptions don't work such as MLB.com Fubo Hulu etc. Sports games and networks.We live in Seattle and the news and channels are all Fresno Ca. When we google something like pizza or whatever near us, It only shows business's in Fresno Ca 850 miles away. T-Mobile customer service told us they would try to fix it and call us back Monday. Never called, I google it and they already have thousands of complaints in many forums.",0
we been with them 12 yrs dont join them all types of bs...phones go down no discount....hulu app established before tmobile gave it to yu free added their code it wipe my whole app...and offerd me another free trial...They ass...stay away...yu will have a headache...if they dont have a attitude with yu they wont help...but they get on the phone as smartass... I'm pretty sure I'm done with this phone company customer service used to be helpful they offer you stuff and then take it away I have the screenshot proof it's time to find a new phone company T-Mobile's not it anymore,0
I have been a t-mobile phone customer for 24 yr.  In the past year 4X my password was changed on my account without my authorization.  After the fact I received an email and a text saying that the change was made and if I didn't make the change I should call.  When I call they say that this is not possible and don't even seem to try to be concerned.Worse yet on one of the 4 occasions when the password was changed someone paid my bill using  info on file 4 days ahead of the scheduled autopay date.  Tmobile did see that this happened as online payments are coded differently than autopayments.  To me this would appear that someone may have testing the system.  However tmobile would only repeat that this will never happen again and I should not be worried.,0
"I am so glad I left this crappy phone carrier but now they apparently added me as an authorized user to mothers account even tho she did not authorize this and neither did I. So who did? They can’t tell me. They want me to verify and pass security but some random stranger who didn’t verify was able to add me as an authorized user without either of our permission. I hope this company burns to the ground, they are such a headache",0
I talked to a person about upgrading mine and my wife's phone and looked into iPhone and was told would have to pay 0 for 2 new iPhones and then i asked about doing one android and was told would have to pay 170.00 something for taxes on a new android phone so hung up and talked to my wife about the increase to the bill for 50.00 for iPhone 14s and 60.00 for iPhone 15s and wife said let's go with the 2 newest iPhones. So called back about 10min later and wanted to get the 2 new iPhone 15's and was told i would have to pay 230.00 something for the taxes i told that person hell no i want what i was told on the previous call and she messaged the first girl i talked to to call me back and she said that the 2nd person was right that i had to pay the taxes but i told her she told me for the iPhones would pay 0 and only would pay if i decided to get android and argued with her that she told me i would pay 0 and she needed to honor what she told me and she said that the system must of messed up and she couldn't honor what she said earlier so i asked for her manager and as soon as he got on the phone he was rude and i argued with him some too and told him i know you recorded all your calls so listen to the call and he said no that no matter what that uncle sam wants his money and that was that. He said he could give me the president of T-Mobiles info and take it up with him but it won't change anything I would still have to pay. I then told him ok fine he's going to lose a customer that's been with them for over 12 years and I'm going to get the rest of my family and friends that have T-Mobile to leave as well and i all ready just in one day got 32 family and friends leaving T-Mobile and going to Verizon with me for lying to me and not giving me what i was told i was going to get. All this will also be posted all over social media and all platforms to the way you all are at T-Mobile telling people one thing one moment and the turn around 10min later telling them something totally different and not wanting to honor what was said the first time. Hope you enjoy losing a-lot of customers for the stupid things you do to your customers and they just take it and not fight back but I'm done taking your bs anymore and this wasn't the first time this has happened to me in the time i was with T-Mobile that was told one thing and then something totally different later and don't want to rectify the issues and just have us all eat it and take it . No more will i take it. I hope a-lot more people see this and step up and fight back as well.Good day a long lived client for 12 years is now gone.,0
"I switched from Verizon to TMOBILE and it has been one of the biggest mistakes I have made.I'm not going into details because it would a novella. All I have to say is that this company could care less about their customers. They screw up and want you to fix it.I'm going to see how complicated it is to go back to Verizon.  I never thought I would say a more expensive bill is worth it, but here I am",0
"Awful customer service. Customer service reps don't know current promotions and are only able to follow a script. Hours of my life I won't get back, and several hundred dollars wasted, due to their lack of timely response or my frustration of having to waste additional hours with little likelihood of resolving my concerns. They then referenced fine print to charge me an additional month of service for five lines, when only one line was active for a single day...The horror stories about their customer service are true!!! Consumers beware!They have lost a reliable customer for life - no more T-Mobile for me.",0
"DO NOT GET TMOBILE PHONE OR INTERNET!  Customer service is horrible, they transfer you to one department, that department then transfers you back cause they say that you should not have been transfered in the first place. The rebates they offer are a scam. They have you jump through hoops to get it yet you still don't receive it. The customer care supervisors (Cliff) lie to you even though everything is recorded. Then they try to blame another company (amazon) until you tell and send them the email from amazon stating they have absolutely nothing to do with said promotion. Stay far away from this company, unless you like wasting time talking to them only to get nothing accomplished!",0
"I switched my phones in October 2023 and they offered me  a new plan (expensive of course) promising pay more on trade in, however they didn't gave the the credits yet.

"I have 4 lines withT-Mobile last year and I was paying $132.00 dollars. In Dec 23. we decided that it was a time to buy 2 new phones, which we did.  I trade in my I phone, but my husband could not because it was broken.  They gave me a $1000.00 for my phone and have to paya 799.00 for my husbands.  So we were expected to pay $35.00 extra for 24 months.  Remember I was paying $132.00 a month for 4 lines, but at that time I did canceled 1 line because we did not needed it anymore So now I only have 3 lines, the guy at the store told me that I would only have to pay for the the telephones and that my monthly payments were going to be 167.99. Which we agreed to it.  But when January came my bill was 232.+, no where near what the guy told me. So I called T Mobile, waited about an hour in the phone for an answer and finally when I got the person on line she was rude, no help at all, and she told me that that was what I signed for and was stuck with it whether I liked it or not.  My opinion about T-mobile, they tell you one thing at the store to get your business, but the reality is another,  and that is how T.Monile fraud their customers out of their money.  This is the way this organization works because the same thing happened to me two years ago. So please be in the look out for this T-Mobile organization because there is never an special with them, they will lure in with this promotions that don't work and you get stuck with a big bill. Their customer service is not good and on top of it they work from some where in Lala land and sometimes you don't understand what they said.",0
"I am writing this letter of complaint because of the unsatisfactory customer service treatment that I received at your store located at 3204 Pennsylvania Avenue SE. I visited the store on Saturday March 2, 2024 and spoke with one of the store representatives. I explained to her that my phone was not working, it had been not holding a charge and finally, went all the way down. She checked the phone and confirmed that the phone was not functioning. She prompted me to make a claim and provided me with a phone to call the claims Department. I proceeded accordingly, and the claim was approved with a $49.00 deductible paid.  My wife opted to have the phone sent to the store for pick-up. I was informed that the phone had arrived at the store and proceeded to pick the phone up at around 10:45 AM on Monday March 4, 2024. The store representative asked a few questions regarding my claim, which I thought was odd, since I had already been through that process. The store representatives requested my identification to verify my identification. After a while, she told me that she couldn’t scan the phone into the system, only the manger had the credentials to take such actions. Therefore, I returned home and went back to the store around 12:35 PM. I was told that the manager had not arrived and was told to return around 2:30. I asked if a regional manger can perform the activity necessary for me to retrieve my phone. I was told no; only the store manger could perform this activity. I waited approximately 35 additional minutes for the store manager to arrive. When I returned to the store, there was a waiting period and then additional questions were asked by the store representative. After a while, the store representative told me that the claim was denied. I was very perplexed because the claim had already been approved. Therefore, I requested to contact the claims department to ascertain what had transpired between my claim being approved to the store denying my claim. The T-Mobile claim representative spoke with the manger, Abdul, because she said that the claim had been approved. After a few more moments, the store representative began to asked additional questions and requested my identification again, now I am not only perplexed, confused but also annoyed. Finally, Abdul informed me that the claim had been denied and proceeded to cancel the order.I am thankful that the customer service department responded by re-ordering the phone and refund my deductible. However, I remain concern regarding this unsatisfactory level of customer service, since this is the T-Mobile store that is closest to my house. I am hoping that this issue is corrected, that I may not experience such horrible services the next time I visit this location.Feel free to contact me should you need to discuss this matter.",0
"We canceled our account and 3 lines (one of which was never in use by us or anyone else) and T Mobile continued to charge us. When I called to complain they refused to refund us. I’ve since had to file fraud with my bank, and will be pursuing legal action. Long story short, unless you want horrible service and to pay for something you no longer use, avoid T Mobile.",0
"After being a customer for many years with this company, they simply do not care. I’ve been paying off a barely working IPhone for 4 years. I have to pay 99.00 to trade it in for the same obsolete model despite signing up for their buy one get one free plan years ago. Due to the fact we’ve upgraded - that was cancelled. Obviously, most people want to upgrade.The company preys on people’s desire to be trendy and in. They prey on their misfortune, and their absentminded selves. They bought Metro PCS so nope, cannot go there and pay less, they bought Sprint, so now cannot go there and not deal with these crazy corporate games since they are TMobile now.We need phones because it’s 2024 sadly. So we put up with it. They know this.There are never any offers local to people in the Northeast for the T-Mobile Tuesdays hardly. There are definitely no offers for loyal customers. No discounts nothing. You want that fancy new phone? You’ll have to pay for it for 4 years in small payments and it’s a never ending high bill.I’ve had to replace my daughters phone about 7 times and pay a fee every time of a whopping 99.00. The Assurian insurance is terrible. If T mobile is such a big company, why not just walk in the store, pay the deductible and exchange phones there if we are to pay the high price? Twice Assurian claimed they lost the old phones we sent in-  threatening to charge us for not sending in the (very broken phones) only for many calls later to have “found” them once shown proof of tracking. It’s truly corporate greed and being treated like a number at its finest.I’ve been told “if we do this for one person we’d have to do it for everyone!”The reason for my final upset - I’ve fallen on hard times these last few months and cannot pay my insanely expensive bill. Our phones will be shut off because they want to argue with me over the fact I cannot pay the last two bills and they will get their money eventually. They are a multibillion dollar company. They make you promise to pay on a Sunday so if you get any money on Friday then it won’t be in that day. You don’t realise this. They do though.They also won’t let a relative or friend pay in the store either or let you pay with an expired ID as I don’t have money to get a new one yet.I’m a responsible person. I had a job. I ended up working for a company who replaced a higher up with a very unprofessional individual to put it nicely - and I left for my safety. I have not been able to get a job since. I’ve been living on savings and some I will get back soon. T mobile cannot wait??? I have proof of this. They are a very wealthy company.This never has happened we have always paid. So clearly something personal is going on. They do not care. They should really have honoured their buy one get one on the phones too but that is not happening either because my daughter wanted to upgrade.So that’s my experience with T-Mobile and that is what happens when a company becomes a monopoly. Thank you.",0
"RUN FROM THEM!This company is a thief!  We cancelled our service and they tried to say it was cancelled 9 days after billing cycle started.  This is a lie.  Also, we were getting Paramount Plus through TMobile.  They were double billing this and would not correct!  So well after cancellation they took the full month payment automatically (the second we cancelled service they cancelled our entire account so we were unable to cancel autopay).  They are refusing to refund our money or guarantee no further charges even though account is cancelled.",0
"Where do I start?My wifi has been down for three days and counting, which is also how long I have tried unsuccessfully to reach someone who can help. Oh yeah, they also have me locked out of my system, and I can get no help with that either. Chat says they need to access my account and apparently they cannot help. Voice line says there's a wait, but they never call back when you request it. I am DONE.",0
T-mobile telephone customer service is extremely frustrating! The agents are often difficult to understand and they have to keep putting you on hold. I was on the phone for over an hour and a half with waiting and being put on hold numerous times. I hope to NEVER have to call them again!!!,0
"Stay away run, run, run!! When 1st signed up promotion $750 off per phone (2 phones) savings $1500 after 7 months l I paid phones off in full. I bought 2 new phones they gave me trade in value and I paid cash for these and ths promotional discount. I stayed another 4 months until sneaky price increase so I switched providers. Following month received bill almost $500 I blew a gasket. What happens those so called ""PROMOTIONS"" are only if you stay with them for 24 months (it's in the fine print). If you get $1000 off per phone don't stay 24 months you pay that    BACK!!!  LONG STORY SHORT.....BEWARE OF TMOBILES PROMOTIONS and other fees I don't even want to type out.",0
They are cheating with Customer and direct pay charging more and stelling my money from my bank account. When called Customer service call goes some other country and with poor English and hard to communicate,0
"The company does not value its customers as they claim. They treated me like crap after been with them for over a decade. The insurance company they use (Assurant) is equally a fraud. They claimed not to receive my old damaged cell phone I sent back to them during a claim. They were charging me $1,100 for the no-good cell phone. Is this how phone and insurance companies suppose to conduct business with their loyal customer? I am going to file against them and switch carrier.",0
"Over-the phone internet T-Mobile rates change within the hour!I telephoned the Pembroke Pines/I-75 store, and Ernesto told me that the internet rate would be $50. I went into the store, filled in all the paperwork, had a soft credit check, lifted my credit freeze on 3 credit bureaus, and then Ernesto announced that “Oh, they just changed the rate a few days ago. The rate is $65.”I wasted 1 hour because of Ernesto’s lie! If you have an hour to waste, telephone T-Mobil, listen to a non-existent rate, then go into the store, and you’ll hear the real rate—which will be higher than the one he quoted.He also told me that I could have a 2-week trial period. But that was over the over-the-telephone rate. Maybe it will be a 2-day trial period if I go into the store. Who knows?Welcome to T-Mobil—where you get a low internet price over the phone, but by the time to get INTO the store, you get the higher price!The store was empty. I should have known. Everyone is smart enough to stay away from Ernesto’s lies. You have been warned!",0
Scammed by Tmobile. They don't honor their promos or their trade in offers then they charge to call customer service where they make false promises and never fix problems.,0
"If could give no start, I would. The worst service, worst coverage. I would never come back to them, and wont' recommend anyone.",0
"I travel a lot so I signed up for their new plan that includes Wi-Fi on domestic flights. They made it sound super easy.  Connect to airplane mode, plane WiFi and then make a WiFi call and you will be connected but of course normal misinformation from T-mobiles.A lot  of flights don’t turn on WiFi until in the air and it’s too late.   T-mobile never comes thru and sells you services that don’t work.",0
Tmobile is absolute garbage. Overcharged the shtt out of us. Then promised to correct the bill over a month ago. Never corrected it. I've contacted customer service dozens of times and had repeated promises that it would be corrected. Last night they said not to worry and our service would not be interupted since I have said I am not paying the bill until it is correct. This morning our service was disconnected and even more additional fees added for the service disconnect. They asked me to pay the full amount to restore service now. This has been the worst service I've dealt with from any cell service. Complete bullshtt.,0
"Returned a watch. They kept charging on the line. when we caught on we had already payed for that line a total of $225. they denied it was returned. They refused refund and if the line gets cancelled, they will cancel the rebate and we would have to pay $93 remaining on the watch.",0
"TLDR: They took money after a free trial and getting it back is a nightmare.Signed up to test T-Mobile home internet service with two weeks trial period. Service seemed fine for what it was, but I got a better price from the service provider I already had, so I canceled with T-Mobile. Store couldn't cancel service, so I had to call. Customer service has been kind every time, but they are useless. I was charged for a month of service ($55) after I had canceled on time and returned all equipment. Upon calling for reimbursement I received $40.21, not the full repayment. That was two weeks ago and the process is on-going. I'm still owed the small amount and it's barely worth the repeated calls and confusion from service reps. I'm no legal expert, but if this is happening on a large scale it seems criminal to me. Promised free trial and they took the money anyway, making it painful to get full refund. If this is happening as a result of their ""system"" it looks like fraud to me, taking money from people with already tight budgets who need cheap internet when they promise a free trial. Won't use them again.",0
T mobile lies to its customers- sells u one deal at one rate & when ur bill comes it's substantially higher. This has happened once to me & once to my mother-in-law. How they get away w this is disgusting. They make u think it's ur ineptitude in understanding the billDISGUSTING....no it's not & hope they get sued over & over. Disgusting ppl running the company. May they rot!!!!,0
I have insurance on screen protector...went to store on davis...no one would wait on me...helped people who came in after me... was there for over 1.5 hourdcalled another store...no one would answer...called 611...they can't help me since I'm on my moms plan...and she wasn't at my house to talk to agent...and I thought vetizon was bad...guess I will have to go back to them...this is unacceptable,0
"T Mobile is overhyped and overrated.   I switched from Verizon due to cost & customer service. T Mobile customer service is second to none.  That's where it ends.  The T Mobile service doesn't live up to its hype.  I drop calls like itthe 80's and service is none existent in many stores or buildings. When my 2 years are up, I will return to Verizon.",0
Don’t go to the Miller Lane (Butler Township Ohio) store. They are thief’s. They stole my two phones I turned in and now am getting charged 2000. I have the boxes and serial numbers and now must contact the Ohio Attorney General today after they said the employees working there were all fired. They’ve been running us around for several months with excuses and say they are fixing but never do anything. They will be getting a call this week from a Consumer Complaint Specialist from the Attorney General’s office.,0
They suck. Updated to T Life so customers can't access T Mobile Tuesday's offers & suck us into buying new expensive phones to bow down to them.  Bad enough they don't take auto bill on credit cards anymore. They're making BILLIONS & screwing customers again.  And the service is crap.,0
very bad exprience with T-mobile today..After being with t-mobile for over 15 years customer service was no help at all..I have always paid for insurance for my Samsung Galaxy phone warranty and since Assurance didnt have it in stock they made me take a very inferior phone called WingTech which gets horrible reviews…Regardless that i pay for a warrenty for Samsung they force you to take it or leave it…I will be looking into other carriers now and leaving T-mobile as soon as possible,0
"As a long-standing T-Mobile customer subscribed to the Magenta® Amplified plan with three voice lines, my experience with the company has been consistently positive without any notable issues. However, on January 15, 2024, we initiated contact with T-Mobile to help us navigate plans and get the best deal possible at that time.  To stay on the current plan and purchase all new phones and increase our monthly bill from $ 157 to $270 or switch to a more expensive plan and get promotions. We opted to switch to the Go5G Next plan, which involved trading in three devices: upgrading from an iPhone 12 to an iPhone 15 Pro and obtaining one complimentary iPhone 15 due to adding a line. During this process, 2 different T-Mobile representatives assured us that, after factoring in all eligible discounts, including a teacher discount, our monthly bill would total $230. The process included 3 steps including changing the plan which is only possible by phone service. We trusted representatives to do it correctly, but unfortunately, it was not the case. The wrong code was applied to one of the lines, the other code was expired and had no value.Despite receiving three new iPhone 15 Pros and one iPhone 15 on January 17, our account still reflected details from the previous Magenta plan. It was only last week that T-Mobile finally updated our account to the Go5G Next plan, resulting in a monthly bill exceeding $349. It feels that we are trapped because according to the agreement we only have 20 days to make changes, but our account information was not updated till it was too late. Until that time (February 6) we were sure that our bill would be $230, not $349 like it is stated now.Upon noticing this discrepancy, I promptly contacted T-Mobile to seek a resolution. Despite investing significant time on the phone with various representatives, the issue with our bill persisted unresolved. I hate to be trapped: phones we used for trade-in cannot be returned to us, and codes for the trade-in are incorrect. The customer service department wasted hours on “investigation’ to come up with “Unfortunately we cannot fix the problem as all those deals are expired now.",0
They have lied to me about my bill and credit.  They want to charge me 60 over quoted rates. All I hear is how no one can do anything g and they will charge me an early termination.,0
"2 years in a row we signed up for monthly internet service during a lengthy stay over holidays. No problem the first year. The second year they continued to charge us and when I called to straighten it out was told only the account holder can cancel. This was not the case the previous year, nor were we told this when we signed up and took the equipment or when we returned it. And it is nowhere in their paperwork. Customer service just says, ""I'm sorry"" or ""I understand"" or blah, blah, blah. I'm pretty sure the supervisor is just the robot at the next desk. So literally, any authorized user can add lines and services because that makes T-mobile money. But when it comes to canceling services and therefore reducing the monthly intake on their end, it takes the account holder. Unethical much? And when I complained that my son (not an authorized user) was able to walk into a T-Mobile store and get a brand new I-Phone, she suggested I go to the store (where he was attending college?!! ) and take it up with the manager. Again with the customer service script that says, ""That shouldn't have happened."" Forget reading small print, it isn't there.",0
"Left T-Mobile due to poor service and dead spots.  Went to local store where they told me I was paid in full.  Received a bill a week later AND a call from a collection company.  Fought this collection. Weeks later I receive a FINAL bill from T-Mobile.  I pay it.  Today I receive a REVISED FINAL bill for $107.00, finally with an explanation of charges. This is four months after I was told I was paid in full. Worst.",0

"The actual speed is too low.We buy this Net service from t-mobile since it offers $10.00 off (the full NET service total becomes $40.00)1. The average speed measured is usually less than 25 Mbit (less than a quarter of the lowest standard 100Mbit/s speed).2. Customer Tech Support Never has a real solution. All solution available is to turn off the power of the Router box. Within 8-days, we made at least 4 calls, but the only real solution is ""to turn it off about 5 minutes then turn it on again"".3. Lie in explaining reason: within 4 calls we reach, the only explanation is ""I saw the technical is working  ... It only takes 1-2 days"". But actually, it is either a lie or they work with the turtle speed. After many days the problem was still not resolved.",0
T-Mobile is refusing to honor their Phone insurance policy with me. Instead they want me to buy a new phone. This is INSURANCE AND CONSUMER FRAUDThey want me to pay $1400 for a new phone when I pay $18 a month to cover my phone. THIS IS THE BIGGEST SCAM EVER.. What a joke they are as a company. I really think they are doing this because I am a senior,0
I purchased international data plan at $30 for two phones to travel for ten days and was unable to use any of the 5 gbs on one phone. Whenever I tried to access internet it wouldn’t let me and times out.  I called T mobile and went through automated service only for it to say to call back during business hours. I called when I got back to get refund and they treated me like I was a liar even though the phone showed that 0 out of 5gbs were used. I tried reaching out to managers and they were even worse. I escalated to another manager above two and that person never called back. I have been loyal and never asked for anything from this company but when you sell me a product that doesn’t work and then treat me like dirt for $30 when I pay $230+ per month it is unforgivable. They wanted to refund me half saying it was my fault that I didn’t constantly reach out to them while overseas and figure out when they were open to help me. Huh! They said that the phone was used because it stated for one day out of ten 0.004 kb were used and that the phone was used on the day I left and was still in the U.S. Despicable! Others have complained about bad service and I will make sure that friends who are chief officers at major companies spread the word. And you will lose a bunch of customers for $15!,0
I wish I would have read these reviews before switching to this $#!t show company. I had to pay $800 to sign up.  I went from Verizon and having internet at work most of the night to this joke of a place having internet 1 hour maybe a night.  Hopefully it's not a run around to get my money back.  2 days of this bs company is more than enough for me. I spoke to customer service 4 times in the last 2 days.  They were also less than useless because none of them speak English.  They mute the phone over and over and try saying the same stupid thing that don't work.  This company is a joke!!! I would rather have no phone than have this trash company for free!,0
"I've been with T Mobile for YEARS! I wasn't even able to do a simple stupid trade in without having to pay money monthly because I was ""grandfathered in on an old plan"".TMobile??

"I had a business account with T-Mobile, with 10 phone lines and a couple of other devices. They guaranteed me credits of $600 per line to switch over to them. Once I switched, they said that I didn’t qualify for those credits and only got $150 per line. My first invoice was incorrectly $1500. In calling them, they said that was a mistake, and I should only pay what I owed, which was about $500. I did that, but two weeks later, they shut off my lines and charge me to turn them back on. They did this four subsequent times over three months. I finally had to transfer out. They are now invoicing me for over $1000 for a phone they say I purchased from them that I had originally bought from Verizon and ported in when I first transferred to them. This company is an absolute train wreck, I have spent countless hours working on it to get resolved. I even come lost a few clients because they could not reach me. They keep telling me they will have someone call me back to me, but they never do. They have now sent my bill for a phone that I owned before I came to them, to collections. Absolutely corrupt!",0

"Mada a huge mistake moving from ATT. From day 1 not happy with how my porting started and the false promotion they promised.My honest recommendation to AT T users please do not switch from ATT, if your are switching please don't come to TMobile because of the below reasons.1. Poor network coverage. They say we support wifi calling , when you are at work you don't have a wifi network and my office is in NYC and I have only 1 point signal. I never had this issue with ATT2. promotions what ever they have won't continue even for a week. The promotions whatever they offered me during the sales got expired before I activated all my numbers. I had to wait couple of days to get my phone unlocked from  ATT by then they said your promotions is expired and I am no more eligible for the promotional offer signed up. More over the promotions is eligible only if we activate all number in your account I order to get all lines.3. We are 5 in the plan the promotions said free phones on all lines when we added free phones we neee asked to pay  800 for the 5th and said this gets credited month on month. Which was not explained by the sales person in the store. We have 5 lines what will the other members think about me when I say this offer no more exists. I am adding them to my line by saying the promotional benefits. What kind trust will I have.my name gets spoiled because of this4. Porting and activation my line was not activated for 24 hrs after porting happened. I did not realize the phone wasn't activated until next day. I had to call them to activate Mt number wherein I had to wait 40 mins on call to get connectedOverall I'm with wrong hands and no more I will refer or recommend my friends and family to T mobile.  After 2 yrs I will switch back to ATT.",0
"I have had the service for a year and 4 months and it the service center that is in the Philippines is the most atrocious comments said to customers I have ever heard and if you complain you they put you on hold,  Comments that have been said to me include, go get a cup of coffee and get a cookie, to just begin with.  They have been charging me for tablets that I do not have every month and I have to be on the phone for 1-2 hours every billing cycle.  I know their prices are good but the customer service is enough to make you insane.",0
"Review of T MobileI ordered T Mobile Wireless Internet. I never received the proper equipment for internet and was charged $112 for a service i did not receive. I returned something i did receive to the store, and they told me it was not the proper equipment for internet. I asked for a refund and they said i had to call a number to do it. I asked can't they do it there? They said no. I called the number and said i didn't receive the proper equipment. They said that means i can get a refund. Then they quizzed me and asked for a 6 digit pin #. I said i don't remember any pin #. Nobody can remember a six digit pin #. They said i had to go to the store to get the refund. I said I was just at the store and they said to call this number. They said that is the only way. I went to the website and tried to log in and it didn't recognize me. Then i went to the store and explained the situation fully. The store clerk asked if i wanted to pay the amount. I said no, i want it cleared out, i was told that they could do that here. She said that she would not service me and asked me to leave!this was 4714 N Broadway, Chicago IL 60640 at 1pm Sunday Feb 4 2024I said i would file a dispute with the credit bureau and this is what i intend to do.

I recently got home internet and they don't even know how to apply my acp benefit which I'm approved for and transfer me to other companies that have absolutely nothing to do with anything. Their website says they accept the acp benefit and I follow the steps to apply it on my online account yet it just logs me out and I cant do anything.

"Stay away! I had tmobile for almost 10 years. At first they were good, over time the service (phone) has been awful for me everywhere. I even had to call multiple times to see what was going on. Was super patient, even tried out their internet. Which sucked in my area and I had to cancel it within 4 months. Anyways the service never improved so I finally left them! And ever since they’ve been treating me bad, I’ve called to pay off my remaining bill and no one helps me. Tried the chat same thing. I received a bill by mail that told me to pay online as a guest and their system won’t let me either. Overall bad phone and internet service and unfortunately bad customer service!! which is why they lost a great client with meCome to find out that they charged my card without my permission for the remaining balance on the phone and the $1 bill owed them for service. Horrible company! I’m appalled, this is illegal",0
"First off, was lied to about a promo deal. The guy who opened our account in the store said the promo came with 2 phones, 2 tablets and a galaxy watch absolutely free. Told him we didnt want the tablets or watch and he said the price  was barely lower without so we should take the promo.  He drew out a plan and said our total amount was $206 including taxes and that would never increase. Realized when we got home that we were charged to activate the tablets and watch. We knew we were paying phone activation fees but were never explained to that we had to pay activation fees for the 3 items we didnt even want to begin with. Tried to take the tablets and watch back the next day and same guy was there, along with the manager who was very unfriendly and unapologetic, and was told we can return them but need to pay a restocking fee and also our promo deal would not be valid anymore and the price would go up so it was in our best interest to keep the devices we didnt want. So we did. Few days later, the bill on my account was $251 so we called customer service.  She didnt know why it was that amount.  Then my husband put in for the first responder discount and auto pay discount and she said the bill would lower to $135 within 1 to 3 days. It did not. Called CS again and the girl said the first responder discount went through and now our bill would be $224 monthly. Asked to talk to manager because the price was higher than we were quoted...and come to find out , phones werent free. We have to pay monthly for them. And the tablets and watch services are also  not included in that ""promo"" price we were quoted. He said we had to go back to the store if  we wanted to return the devices and would be charged those restock fees but we would qualify for a better discount. So all in all, we will have paid close to $200 in activation and restocking fees for 3 devices we clearly told the 1st guy we didnt want. We will have nothing to show for it but wasted time, aggravation,  and $200 wasted as well. Once our contract is up, we will be leaving tmobile for good and i would NEVER recommend anyone go there, especially the lanoka harbor nj store. No one is held accountable for giving us false info, or straight out lies even. Talked to 3 reps on the phone, one a manager, and 3 reps in store, also including one manager. Every representative had a different answer to give and gives you the run around on who to talk to so you go in circles calling CS and going back to the store. They are a disgusting company with incompetant liars for employees!Edit: just went to the corporate store in toms river nj and the employees and manager were very helpful, and apologetic for what happened in the other store. They got us on the plan we originally wanted and did their best to refund what they could. I recommend going to that store if any one ever wants to deal with t mobile",0
"honestly criminal, I got a phone at the store which had many issues that they replaced. however, they didnt have the replacement in stock, they ordered one. It didnt show for two weeks and i couldnt continue to have a phone that worked 50% of the time. I went back in and the store gave me the next best one for no upcharge. HERE IS WHERE THINGS WENT WRONG. new person, did the activation under a ""Lease"" even though i paid for the phone in full originally. They were not able to back up the error because the IMEI and other numbers were already in the system because of the activation. After HOURS they gave me a credit for the ""lease"" on my account. fast forward until now, lease is up and they are asking me if i want to KEEP my phone or RETURN it. well its mine, i paid in full. i called in to tell them this and they argued, told me i was wrong, they said i got the upgraded phone and its worth more so NOW i need to pay for it. total joke, scam, and should be illegal.",0

"I've been T-Mobile for about 2 years. I had an interest in upgrading my phone so, I did my homework, decided on a phone and began the omupgrade on the T-Mobile websiteThe figures provided were fine however, when you get to the consent page (to agree to the figures) everything changes to higher monthly payment amounts, your trade-in value is nowhere to be found etc.....I previously thought T-Mobile was a halfway decent carrier but, they're nothing but corrupt, unethical scumbags.Some Pinhead rep told me their ""system"" wasn't functioning properly and he then quoted me the price I originally saw. Too late! They lost my trust. Time to move on to another carrier.....",0
"Will continue to give bad reviews until coverage service improves again. Decade ago, used to be good then they absorbed sprint. Now emails come thru in big blocks rather than as they should one at a time and emails don't go thru and I constantly have to resend.",0
"After 3 wonderful years I just had the most disappointing conversations with T-Mobile. What's changed??  My services were suspended with no advance notice, with no messages, no communication whatsoever. The reason, I'm told, is because there was one missing payment. Meantime T-Mobile has not 1 but 2 valid forms of payment and I have never missed any previous payments. After spending crazy time on the phone trying to understand and rectify the issue I was then told different answers by different supervisors. The last crazy conversation was about a $15 credit I should have received and was not provided. Enough is enough. Good by T-mobile until you return what you used to be.",0
"Worst customer service! They had a problem with our internet, it took from 1/9/24 until today 1/26/24 to finally get service. It took a change of a modem and we were supposed to make another trip to get a second modem today but there is a snowstorm so we didn’t go. During the last hour, service magically came back on. We spoke to them as we have many, many times this month and they would not give us a refund on this month’s bill. So instead of 300 gb, we were only able to use 23 gb, but they still wanted full payment! After my husband spoke with them, they gave us $40 off our bill and told us it was the best their manager could allow because they didn’t know if we would use a thousand gb tonight! So $93.57 for this month of 23gb. Terrible customer service! We are looking to switch.",0
"Worst ever, employees do a ripoff not explaining none of their offers or details of their packages. Got a prepaid card, payed 3 months in advance to keep the line active, cause I’ll be out of the US (no one told me I won’t be able to receive SMS nor calls and the line will be dead), so those 3 months in advance payment is wasted as the line is inactive but payed for. When I called them, they told me to upgrade to 40$ plan to just be able to receive SMS to the line, and calls if any. I told them I just need the line active, and I payed in advance cause T-Mobile guess what - receiving payments from cards issued only from certain countries and my home country isn’t the one. I told them, I’m outside of the US, payed in advance to have the line active - none informed me of additional minimum charge for prepaid roaming, and I can’t upgrade my plan as the card I have isn’t from one of 15 countries which is accepted. Money wasted time wasted stress from dealing with thiefs. Zero zero zero stars, do not get anything from this ripoff and their uninterested staff - worst experience in Seattle and Chicago! Philippinos on the call center are friendly, however talking much and zero helpful as their company is - zero.",0
Was contacted by a T mobile business rep. Said they could lower our bill. Instead they open 3 accounts and triple billed us. Called customer service repeatedly but tge barely English speaking reps couldn’t help because there business rep. opened accounts. The internet barely worked. Horrible company. I left for Verizon and never got our money back.,0
"I have been with tmoble for ever. I just bought a new phone, and be honest, I wish I had my old one. Not only was it expensive, it is terrible. Talking on phone I hear echo, on speaker, they hear ehcos. Always kicking me off of internet, pictures are terrible. I can't afford a new phone, but seriously thinking of moving on to new company to get one.",0
"The only way to improve this company is to shut it down. They charge for items they say are a gift for loyal customers ( you discover it later on your bill). They steal items you trade in, and then the customer service simply doesn't consider your complaints anymore. They are overpriced. What else? Sometimes you find a competent associate, but it's pure chance.",0
"I have been a T-Mobile customer for over 10 years, but my experience has been far from satisfactory. Living in a densely populated area, I expected reliable cell coverage. However, T-Mobile's service was so inadequate that they had to provide an amplifier to boost the signal. It was one (two, actually) more devices running in our house, but it solved the issue.Fast forward to when I decided to cancel my service due to moving abroad. To my astonishment, T-Mobile charged me $300 for the amplifier they provided 8 years ago - a piece of equipment that is practically obsolete and that they sold to customers for only $100 back in 2019.Attempting to resolve this issue, I spent several hours with their customer service. While the representatives were friendly, it felt like they weren't really listening (I had to repeat some basic facts several times). They never truly addressed my concerns.Needless to say that I'll never be a customer again.",0
"T-mobile contacted me about their 5G home internet service. The t-mobile rep offered me one price, but when the bill arrived it was over 50% more. I called and was told that offer had expired, and they would not honor the price. But I never asked for it. It was T-Mobile who made the offer. I am a current t-mobile customer and have been for years. Now how can I trust an offer or anything that I'm told going forward. Too bad!",0
T-Mobile encouraged me to buy a SIM card they knew wouldn’t work for my phone. Now I’m out 50 dollars and a terrible customer service experience.,0
"My husband and I have used Sprint/TMobile for several years and have had HORRIBLE experiences with them. We’ve tolerated questionable billing practices, bad customer service, inept management, spotty coverage, lousy promotional offers, outright lies about pricing and contract terms, impenetrable website login pages, inestimable wastes of time with general problem resolution, and terrible equipment- related issue resolution. I know mergers are never seamless but this irredeemable mess of a company needs to close down. We can’t wait for our new phone company to take over our account. Run as fast and as far as you can from Sprint/T Mobile if you value your sanity and money.",0
I have T-Mobile internet and phones They sent me a lap top thru the mail which I told them I did not want numerous times and sent it anyhow. They will not take it back and now they’re charging me for it. They lied about taking it back so now I am stuck with it They told me to sell it . But it only works on t mobile so I am stuck with this useless laptop. I ll be looking for a new service,0
Worse people to deal withManagers a d supervisors will not talk to. Customers and no help puts you on hold than transfers you to another useless rep.I will never recommend any one to them,0
"Absolutely the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Contract was a bait and switch, with false representation of what was included, the ""guaranteed"" monthly cost, etc. The store said to contact corporate, and corporate said it was the store's responsibility to make things right. Stay away from ALL elements of T-Mobile!",0
"Promises were made by one of their phone ""Advisors"" and broken as soon as we got of the phoneIn my case and my opinion I would say shady business practices.",0
"I have a One Plus 8 phone that I bought from One Plus directly that is locked by T-Mobile. At the time, my carrier used T-Mobile lines so it wasn't a problem. After countless efforts to get T-Mobile to network unlock The phone, I was told that I would need to purchase a prepaid card from them so they could access the phone. Then after having it for about a month and a half, I called again to have it unlocked. Custom Service is clueless! Apparently they don't keep any records of previous phone calls and I have to go through the whole issue again just to have them tell me there's nothing they can do. Finally after at least three supervisor calls, I get one by the name of Alex who convinced me that he had taken care of the situation and my phone would be unlocked in 24-48 hours. He said I would get an email. It's now a week later and my phone is still locked, no email has come, and I am forced to call them again. This time I get Becky. Becky tells me there is no record of my phone calls with Alex or anyone. Funny she did give me a call reference number though. Becky tells me I have to do a factory reset to unlock it. I'm not seeing that this will work either. I will update if it does, but at this point, I have at least 15 hours of talk time to customer service in which ten of those were on hold. I still am not able to use my phone with my regular carrier. Don't ever get T-Mobile! They are terrible! They hire people that you can't understand and it doesn't matter because they don't know what they are doing anyway. I think I may have to complain to the FCC. T-Mobile has no right to keep my phone locked. Thanks for nothing Alex!",0
"T-mobile is the most deceptive, Greedy, and scammers that I have fully experienced with this company stole money three times from my account without having my permission  I'm not happy with the service and the company which I believe is a crooked establishment",0
"After being with a competitive Telephone Carrier for decades, I decided their fees were too high, and decided to save money by going with T-Mobile and their advertised rates.HUGE MISTAKE.Signed up, and spent THREE (3) days trying to get both of my lines working.  NOTHING worked correctly.  THREE (3) days of wasted time.  They couldn't get both lines connected, service quality was worse than poor, and their agents were totally clueless.I then cancelled service, switched to a new Carrier and WHOA  !!!!  everything immediately worked perfectly. BUT !!!   T-Mobile wasn't finished. They had me set up in 'auto-pay' and thus began a multi-month disaster of trying to get them to remove incorrect charges.  HOURS spent on the phone, talking with agents who promised to transfer me to their Supervisor, but who instead switched me back into the general call incoming 'pool'  wherein I had to Start ALL-OVER-AGAIN with a new agent, describing the issues, and trying to find an iota of justice.   More DAYS spent trying to get rid of these bottom feeding losers.  BUT, it's even WORSE !!! They automatically put my account into 'COLLECTIONS and then more clueless scammers calling, trying to collect monies on a NON-EXISTING account.STAY AWAY from these low life brain dead liars, and scum.  They cheat, steal, and scam the innocent public.    OTHER carriers are FAR more professional and courteous.  T-Mobile will NEVER achieve even a minimal level of professionalism.Please NO DOT blame me when you get 'burned' by these low life scum.",0
"After 6 weeks of frustrating, fruitless calls to T-Mobile customer service I finally walked into the T-Mobile store in person -- after my third visit to the store, a rep was present who had my problem solved in about 15 minutes. I had spent approximately 15 hours over 6 weeks of calling T-Mobile customer service and spoke to so many different reps, supervisors, technical engineers, etc., and none of them could find a solution. Many of them promised to call me back with a solution, and none of them followed through on the promise, and many of them failed to even call me back at all. The DIGITS app was not working dependably--I was continually not receiving all texts. I used DIGITS for my business line and I wanted to keep my business number on my same phone. Why did it take so long for a T-Mobile rep to suggest adding a second line to my phone??? It seems like a simple answer. I wasted a lot of time before finally having my issue solved.",0
"Horrible service at TMobile! I’ve been a loyal customer for 25 years. I get ooor reception on the lines, overcharging of my bills, and poor explanation of service and benefits. This company needs an overhaul!!! No one can answer a strait question! I don’t recommend them!",0
I am not a customer of T-Mobile but am receiving nuisance calls from their call centre on average 3-4 times per week. I have repeatedly asked them to take my number off the list & stop calling me but yet the issue persists for over a year. My number is registered with tps so who knows how they got it. Awful. I am sick of the stress & interruptions.,0
"1 star because 0 wasn't an option.  T-Mobile raised my rates so I decided to switch to another carrier.  They canceled my service but kept auto-billing me.  I was on the phone with customer service for hours, completely useless and unhelpful.",0
My husband changed his cell and our home to t mobile. Thank heavens I kept my phone with Verizon. They cut service off before the due date. He is constantly getting his service interrupted. He has made like 5 payments in two months and pays whatever they tell him to pay but our service is interrupted every other week and it's frustrating spending hours on my Verizon cell phone calling T-Mobile to figure out what on earth has happened and if they can get it turned back on. They usually want another payment. I've never seen a company act like this ever. It's insanity. My husband is returning his phone tomorrow and disconnecting his service.  He has promised not to change our home wifi again.,0
"I thought I would save money by using T-Mobile and I did. However, I dropped an average of three calls per day for the ten months I had this service. They could not offer me any better service so I canceled.Then, after canceling, I was late on my final payment. After they did receive the payment a month late, they billed me late charges and sent me to a collection agency. I received both bills in the same week.Terrible service and terrible billing procedures. So glad I went back to my old carrier.",0
"I don’t want to sound like I'm exaggerating and writing with a lot of emotions after multiple times trying to get their support. I want to ensure that they have been by far the worst customer service I have experience with all the mobile service companies. If you look forward to have good customer service and have a company that ensures they improve on this, T-Mobile is not the one. Also depending on the area that you live the cell reception is very poor. I recommend to ensure that fits but the customer service is the worst of all companies. Hopefully they improve that soon and don’t keep losing their customers.",0
No customer service online only a virtual robot,0
"I've been with T-Mobile for quite a few years, but sadly, the customer service is severely gone downhilli’ve done many upgrades in the past with no problems in mailing back the trade-in devicewhere my problem comes this time I didA upgrade last November to a very expensive phone got the phone no problem activatedIt mailed back my trade-in phone tracked it. It shows received first part of December where the problem lies I had paperwork showing I was supposed to get $585 for that phone I have never received the promised credit to my account I have now had 12 phone calls to T-Mobile telling me to keep waiting they showed the phone has been received, but it may take a while to get the credit last phone call now is telling me to wait two more bill cycles BS!!I have done a lot of upgrades. It does not take two months to get your credit. I used to work in a large wireless call center. I know how it works and this is nothing but BS that they are feeding me.I have called multiple times asking for a manager only to be told one is not available or one would call me back, but they never doI am severely close to just paying off my phones and taking my lines to another carrier. Only problem is I live in an area where I’m really limited on cell phone carriers as cell reception. Here is not great unfortunatelyall I can say is save yourself, major major grief. If you decide to do an upgrade, go to a store, never do one through the mail, or be prepared to eat the money you were promised better yet stay the hell away fromt-Mobile",0
What a very sore company I tell them I had covid and that I won't have no money until the 19th and that my account will go negative if they take it out and what do they do still take it out and they said that they would help me but yet they still took it out I will be changing carriers once this is done and over!!!!,0

My wife signed up for a T-mobile account for her new iPhone. The account was almost immediately hacked. My wife went to China to care for her mother. Then she discovered her T-mobile account was hacked. The thieves were able to completely take over the phone number. All sms verifications went to the the thieves. They were then able to hack all her bank accounts. They even extended the limit on her credit cards and drained them. We were trying to close the T-mobile account the whole time. T-mobile refused to close the account and every time my wife tried to create a new bank account the thieves used the T-mobile account to take over the new bank account. T-mobile refused all assistance. Now my wife is stuck in China with no way to dispute the charges made in her name or even create a new bank or credit card. T-mobile has allowed my wife to remain powerless in China and will not allow me to close the account either.,0
"THE WORST CELLPHONE COMPANY!!!!I HATE T-MOBILE!!!!!!!!!!!I REPEAT I HATE T-MOBILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This company suckers people with contracts. I was told by 7 different  representative different prices of my phone. I was sucker by a white female  My phone was stolen and T-mobile insisted on telling me I was under contract. This means I am responsible for a stolen phone that I will never see again. 2 representative/employees; a rude black female with an attitude named Tiss and a white smart mouth male supervisor name Jason that lives in Charleston South Carolina, insisted on threatened me in to pay as if I still had the phone. I had to pay for Price of phone, accessories, data plan, cords, and screen protect and insurance, even though I don't have the iPhone 14. My account had a 360 insurance, in case the phone is lost or stolen. I was charged for a stolen iPhone 14 pro max. This company didn't care that my phone was stolen or tried to give me another phone. They only care about getting money. NO STARS!!!! SEVERAL HANDS DOWN WORST CELL PHONE COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!",0

"I have been trying to deal with adding lines as well as a change in ownership of 3 current lines- been a customer for 7 years- the customer service is HORRIFIC.  Sure, they are polite and read their scripted cues beautifully, but they have ZERO idea what they're actually doing and I've gotten incorrect information over and over and over again..... I've spent 30+ hours on hold, talking with a rep, or chatting online to try and get things resolved.

"To start with, if I could give a negative number I would. Today 1/1/2024 my son was trying to switch carriers as he was on our account. When he received the SIM card, we found out his phone was locked, because we owed a $1.32. This was an unknown balance to my husband and I. The $1.32 was sent to collections. My husband and I cancelled our service on 12/5/2023. We switched to PureTalk. My phone ended up being locked as well. My husband took my phone into a T-MOBILE store and was unlocked with no mention of a balance owed and in collections this was on 12/7/2023. We've been on off the phone with T-Mobile Customer Care Services off and on since 4pm (1/1/2024) We have spoken to2 different operators on currently on hold for a third who is Supervisor #2...We were previously told that since we cancelled our service before we had a credit of $92.00, again no mention of $1.32 that was owed. Mind you our bill was due by the 9th of each month, so technically our bill was not due until 1/9/2024, if would have stayed with them.  Since, we cancelled 12/5/2023 there should not be bill owed...now it's in collections not even a month later...Way to T-Mobile, you rock and still on the phone at 11:33 at note with no resolution. My husband is going to the Cooperate office tomorrow...",0
"I was a T Mobile customer for nearly 10 years.  Over that period, their customer service has gone downhill.  Hold times to reach customer service are now 30 minutes to an hour.On December 26, 2023 at 12:31pm, I called T Mobile to protest an increase due to their declining my autopay discount; they wanted banking account & routing info, which I was not willing to provide.  I was on hold for over 30 minutes.  They subjected the on-hold caller to music and a recorded voice cut in every minute, saying ""we'll be right with you"" and sometimes asked you to ""name that tune"".  During the long wait and bot cut-ins, I wondered ""why are we being treating so poorly!?""I decided I'd had enough and cancelled my T Mobile service on 12/26/23.  It turned out to be the worst customer experience I have ever had.  Our two Iphones had a T Mobile SIM/Carrier lock.  I could not begin service with the new carrier until the phones were unlocked. I spoke with a T Mobile tech on 12/26/23 and requested the SIM unlock for the two devices.The next day, 12/27/23, the phones remained locked, so I drove to my local T Mobile store, and the employees were unable to help.  They said I had to work with T Mobile's Customer Care group (via phone).It ultimately took almost 25 hours and about 3.5 hours on the phone with various T Mobile people (plus two more charges on my credit card) for T Mobile to finally unlock the phones.  It was a version of “kick the can”:  one rep told me I needed to do a factory reset on my phone to unlock it.  She transferred me to an Apple Care tech, who advised me that T Mobile needed to unlock the phone and that a factory reset would NOT unlock it.In the last call, I was on the phone with a T Mobile tech for well over two hours to get the phones unlocked.    Before I could get the phones unlocked, they asked me about returning equipment I had already returned (a signal booster which didn't work, and that they failed to support, I had returned it months earlier) and about paying them for an Iphone we had paid for in cash months earlier.This was just an awful experience.",0

"My experience with T Mobile the worst company that I have dealt with in my 76 years. I went.to the Mechanicsville Va store and got the internet gateway to try for 15 daysI could not get a good signal to far from tower. I took it back 4 days later and was told we won't take it back and to drive another 30 minutes to another store where they took it back. That's only the beginning I started getting charged 55.00A month for 2 months on credit card.I called and they said they would take care of it. I called again two weeks later and they said it would be taken care ofI called again and sorry.it would be taken care of and today I get a collections notice for 110.00I called again and asked to speak to manage and got no satisfaction. I just filed a complaint with the Attorney General Office ,BBB and FCC to have this removed from my credit report.

I received a email from Marty ceo of the response team telling I returned the equipment on 11/16/23 and not on 10/16/23 and he would offer to erase the 95.33 if The claim was over. I sent the receipt for the return showing 10/16  now that's  the ceo of the response team can't even get it right.

I have been with t mobile for over 6 years now and slowly they are showing their true face. For the past 3 months i have been really patient. I wanted to upgrade my paid off iphone to their latest version and they sent me the wrong phone and had to send me a new order. Now they have messed up my account and I owe double what I used to. My new monthly bill now is $750 which is ridiculous. I have been on the phone with them every other day and they keep promising we will get to the bottom of this but they never do. They have now suspended my line for the 4th time because I was promised a call and resolution from some of their supervisors who completely ghosted me as this seems to be a more complicated situation. I rely on t mobile for my business and they have not held their end.,0
"I was with Sprint for a long time, they switched to TMobile. While I was with Sprint I fully paid off every phone I had and always did the trade in to upgrade.

I would have just sold them on my own. I lost $400, please learn from my mistake.",0
"I used to get good service from T-Mobile, but now it's terrible and I plan to switch companies. I hope I can find a better company.

"I don't see any use for the T-mobile store in the Westfield Oakridge Mall. The manager of the store - Eduardo has no powers and they don't honor anything that the T-mobile app online offers. All the sales folks have parroted 'only eligible if you upgrade your plans to 5gGoplus plan'. There was a time when they'd invite and go the distance to retain customer satisfaction but now with their domination in the market, all of them display 'arrogance' - the manager in particular. Is there a way to notify T-mobile upper management to reconsider either removing the manager or empowering the stores to honor online offer or remove the store completely?",0
"I chose the 55+ plan since it allowed two lines, one for me and one for my out-of-town college kid.  I was using a Droid and moved over to the iPhone 11.  Then T-Mobile “upgraded” the antenna my phone was using to connect to.  Weeks of trouble started and when CS ran a “diagnostic” on my connection, it blew out my Cisco WiFi router.  They gave me “generous” $75 to replace it.  No way!  Cisco didn’t sell $100 devices then.  I was told by CSRs that management was considering replacing my phone with a 12.  Right, in a pig’s eye!  I had to buy it and the improvement was minimal.Calls to customer service went to through to nauseatingly polite representatives, or once in a while people who really didn’t want to work. The big red check is a no go from the start and all the smaller guys are subcontracted to the “big boys” in the market place and offer contracts of dubious, IMHO, value to the customer.So, as soon as junior finishes his studies, I will return to a flip-phone or no mobile phone.Experience, what you get immediately AFTER you need it.",0

"Call the 611 because my account was frozen.  Phone tech could not get into my billing. Made payment . Had payment plan $64 on the 21st and $64 on the first of January. Well T-Mobile locked it down because I haven't made the January 1 2024 payment....it's December 21st ....so i had to pay the Jan 1st bill on the 21st just to be able to get my other phone activated.The attitude of customer service was good at first till I stood my ground so I put it on speaker phone. Every one in the electronics section heard her crappy attitude asking me ""why am I still waiting on you"" ...get rid of horrible bs loopholes and sell the company to Temu!!!!!!¡",0
"There is a reason why they don't ever document any conversations or the trade in value of the phone you just gave them.  I was told $1000 for the trade in value, then I sent in my phone, I never got the $1000, I got partial credit like $440, I called them a dozen times about this, each time I was told different BS or excuses, 6 months later I am still calling about the correct trade in value, this time they said my original promotion had expired at the time I sent in my phone.  I've had enough with them.  Every time (after at least 1 hour) of talking to them and getting them to agree it's $1000, I ask for an email or some kind of written documentation to say what they agreed on, they dodge this request and refuse to document this trade in value.  I've had at least 3 supervisors giving me their verbal ""personal guarantee"" that I will get my $1000 and 6 billing cycles later, I am still not getting it.  They really try to scam you in any way possible and hoping customers won't notice the little charges here and there, or hoping that we would just give up because no one has the tenacity of calling them over and over and spending tons of hours and mental stress dealing with them.",0
"If I could give them a 0 I would. Worst company every. First they lied to us when we started a plan with them. We were told that we were getting a phone for free which was a complete lie.

Now I want to downgrade my service on their prepaid number they are giving me the ran around again saying my account is suspended. I told them I don't have an account with them the number is prepaid.

"Hello, after finding out the router I originally bought from T-Mobile needed an upgrade I thought that this would be an easy transition to a new upgraded one.

Not sure if they were not configuring the router on purpose at the store because. Or again they just didn't know what they were doing. And this is after speaking with the manager and the rep. After the 3rd router, I was still unable to configure the router to log in. So I went back to the store to get a replacement the manager and rep started arguing with me because the court information wasn't on the router. Sand the manager stated after this router is replaced I cannot come back to this store if something goes wrong with the router. But it was their fault I had to go through so many routers before. So after replacing this router, I needed to make sure this router was up and running before I left the store while I was video on my phone this whole incident. This rep thought I didn't see him on his cell taking a screenshot of all the router information IMEI, router password, etc. So immediately after I left the store I called T-Mobile to tell them what had happened so this could be recorded. To me, the rep didn't sound too interested in this incident and was more concerned with a second line and another new phone. And now after putting in the ""new router"" overnight it reset itself and now I have had to reconfigure this router 3 times because it keeps getting hacked and I know it's because of the manager and rep at that store.  Wow... Store# 9062. I think they should retrain their management and staff because whatever they doing is not working. I'm in contact with a lawyer. This doesn't make any sense. I hope this doesn't happen to other customers at other stores like this happen to at this one.I will be posting my experience with the store and Tmobile everywhere. This is crazy!!!",0
"I have been a customer for at least 25 years. And have always been happy with them until yesterday. I went in to buy my granddaughter a phone which I raise. And noticed tax was way higher than it should of been, So I questioned it. They said its a one time activation fee of 35 added. I said since when! This is my phone number that I've had for years and we are switching the sim card over. And so the argument began. I will also mention I haven't worked in months because I've been busy fighting cancer. So I had to get in my bill money and take out the other money. This is nonsense. My husband and I both need new phones too. But they just lost two sales. I am going back to buying off of market place or Craigslist. Very very disappointed in this practice that started last year. And the lady waiting on me said it's always been that way! Wrong! I said I can't wait to get my survey when I leave the store. And for the first time ever they did not send me one.",0
"I was with Verizon for 22 years.When I saw the Ad. On tv about TMobil offer iPhone free for each line and their rates I called TMobil spoke to a sales representative (every thing was recorded by T Mobil) I told her I want to switch 5 lines from Verizon to T Mobil.She said we are eligeable for 5 iPhone 14 free.I told her I just want one iPhone 14Pro Max and one IPhone 14 Pro and I am not taking all iPhone 14 in that case TMobil saving lots of money but Insted 5 iPhone 14 free I want 1 iPhone 14 Pro Max free,and 1 iPhone 14 Pro free.I advised her to talk to her supervisor and if TMobil agrees to my deal I will switch.After 1/2 hours of explanation she agreed that I do not hand to pay any thing for iPhone 14 Pro Max and 7 $ a month for 24 months for I phone 14 pro.I agreed. Now T Mobil is keep charging money for both phone.I called T Mobil back many times but things are not redolved",0
"Staff told us in person, we would not have any extra charges for our cruise trip to Bahamans, Jamaica, Haiti, with our Unlimited plan.  However, when we got a couple hundred $$$ bill they would not issue a credit to cover their employee's miss information. After speaking with C.S. and the manager James Soriano they opted to not honor their employee's word.This is rough as we are forced to use this company due to coverage for home use.  Its also painful to hear the staff and management ask us to call other people to fix this issue and all we got was another person passing the blame with no good results.Furthermore, each time I've walked in, staff was too busy to acknowledge me even if I was the only one in the store. Yesterday I had to watch Neisha walk around for 10 mins before she helped me and I felt like it was a problem that I was there.The issue here is their word is not been good with us now on 2 different occasions.It's not about the money here. Its about the lies and wasting other peoples time. Belmont NC store",0
worst customer service ever. the guy on the other end of the phone is barely understandable. and all they do is dance around your issues with non-helpful questions and bs.,0
"I would not ever recommend going to T mobile!! The customer service is the worst of the worst and nobody will do anything to help resolve issues. I purchased a phone on 25Nov, received notification from UPS that my package was lost I was told that I should be refunded by the 6th, that didn't happen, I was then told I would receive my refund by the 14th, that didn't happen and am now being told it's not going to be resolved until the 29th. There is clearly a lack of communication in this organization and the fact it's taking over a month to fulfill or refund orders is horrible. I will be switching to AT&T as soon as this order is refunded. Whenever that will be.",0
DO NOT DO IT! WORST COMPANY EVER. GOT THEIR WIFI UNDER THE 15 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE AND SENT THE EQUIPMENT BACK WITHIN 7 days and they sent me to collections for $112….Tried calling them and they said the 6 digit pin I gave them was incorrect and there’s nothing they can do for me. I even offered my Social Security number and they refused….,0
"I’ve had T-Mobile internet for less than a month. It has been down three times with no notice, even when it’s planned maintenance.This is 2023 T-Mobile, you should have;1 sent out notices2 have an automated line for outages because your outsource help is less than worthless.3 have number that will update on your outages.Knock knock, it’s almost 2024.",0
"switched from ATT.  From day 1, most calls get dropped and more than 50% of text messages won't go through.    After 12 FULL hours with Tmobile support, they could not figure out how to make their service work.   I then asked chatGPT and it said to check if I was using Google messages.  Sure enough, the employee at the store had installed and set that up as my text app WITHOUT my permission.   I deleted the Google message app and Text messaging is better, now at least 80%, but still some are being missed and/or delayed significantly.  We tested it is not location based.  Tried connecting at 5+ cell towers with 5 bars and still an issue.Switching back to ATT.",0
"Walked into T-mobile 1491 W Mason St, Green Bay, WI 54303 with a phone I bought offline ready to buy a plan and start service.  The two employees there never acknowledged me so I took a seat and waited for a half hour while the employees continued to pretend I didn't exist so I finally left.  The next day, my husband took the phone there and the same guy who was working yesterday claimed he couldn't hook this phone up with service, he was completely aloof and very unhelpful.  I took the phone to a different T-mobile store a few blocks away and they hooked it up, no problem.  That location is notoriously subpar and I wonder how it stays open with those kind of employees.",0
"signed up for home internet never worked properly. (spotty at best) Contacted them 4 separate times, no better. wanted to cancel had to complete billing cycle. charged for somthing that never worked as promised.",0
If I could leave a negative Zero rating for Tmobile I would. Customer service is horrible they have to be the most incompetent people I have EVER COME ACROSS Down to my most recent conversation with a manager named John!! If he is in charge I understand why they can get it right. I asked to cancel my service on November 26 its December 7th and my lines are still on. I advised sprint's service was crappy but customer service was so much better his response oh we won't do what you want no sir I want you to do what is right I work in a collection environment I don't believe that the customer is always right but I do stand on principles and excellent customer service and TMobile has NEITHER!! Do yourself a favor buy a phone LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE save yourself from the JOHN'S and Tmobile unfilled agreements!,0
"Went to T-Mobile store in Sept 2023. Brought my parents to my account and was given ""free"" phones, as a promotion.   Was told to verify with T-Mobile regarding billing.  When i did so in September,  I was told I would see the charge for the phone, but would also see a credit for that same amount.  So here it is December and I'm being billed for the phone with no credit.  Called T-Mobile.  The rep stated there was no promotion on ""their"" end, and there were no notes on my account regarding a call regarding a credit,  and they were sorry someone told me I would get a credit.  I asked who would review the recording of that previous conversation, I was told to go to the store (an hour away) to try and resolve my problem.",0
"On 12-06-23, my mother and I walked in to the T-mobile store located at 1491 W Mason St, Green Bay, WI 54303 to buy a phone and start a plan.  We walked in and we were never greeted at all, no ""hey"", no ""we'll be with you in a minute"", nothing.  We took a seat and waited for a half hour but were never even acknowledged in the least so finally, exasperated and a bit shocked, we got up and left.  Those two T-Mobile workers in there were the two most rude, unqualified airheads I've ever personally experienced in a retail setting.  Their customer service, or lack thereof, was horrible and virtually nonexistent.  Even a dog will come up and greet someone, these people could not have ignored us more.",0
IF THERE WAS A 0 START THATS WHAT I WOULD GIVE THEY ARE THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD,0
Horrible! Don’t get involved with these crooks. Signed up on a “promotion” to buy a phone for 400.00. I didn’t need 24 months to pay off 278.00. They said if I wanted to leave my phone would now cost me 800.00. These guys are thieves and thugs,0
They changed billing to paperless without letting customers know. Now it costs $1.99 to get a detailed bill in the mail! That's absolutely insane.,0
"if you travel abroad, be aware that you probably won’t get your voicemails. They will tell you all you have to do is dial 123 on the phone. However, halftime that does not go through. Sometimes it says your passcode is incorrect even though it is. Also, it will say that you have no voicemails and then as soon as you get back to the United States you have about eight some of them from over a week ago that we’re not showing up which, of course, is costing you business.   I can’t imagine it being too terribly difficult to get a voicemail system that also works in Europe or Asia. It just doesn’t seem hard to my imagination.",0
"T-Mobile literally stranded us abroad and proceeded to extort us and lie to us. We upgraded to iPhone15 Pro's and changed our plan with a salesperson in South Florida. We have a second line on our phones which we use when we are in second home in Ecuador. The salesperson said we would simply need to change to an esim to install it. We tried that, but the phones are locked, and T-Mobile does not do temporary unlocks for travel anymore. After calling and working through their process, Janica (a Supervisor), told us if we paid off the phones in full ($2k), she would get them unlocked for us. We did. Seventy-two hours later (the latest she said it would take), they are not unlocked. We cannot access our bank down here without secondary text message on our Ecuadorian line; we cannot access our healthcare plan or communicate with our physicians, etc. A new CS rep said she would put in a request and it would take 24-72 hours more.  Still not done-- T-Mobile's service is reprehensible.",0
Tried to order watches for Christmas gifts for my kids. Took 5 sales people and 1 managers and they still got the order wrong. When I called t mobile in Wyandotte I was told for me to just go online and order the bands myself or call the number they can’t help me. I’m talking being on hold trying to place the order for over 10hrs total and the order comes wrong. Now after sitting on hold asking for new bands to be sent to me for two hours. I’m waiting for a manager for another hour or two to try to correct the problem. ￼,0
"We upgraded our devices to the iPhone 15 Pro with dual e-sim slots and upgraded our service plans accordingly to Go5G Plus which would make is eligible for upgrades every 2 yrs and with the promo would pay off the phones over those 2 yrs. However, if you wanted to take advantage of the second e-sim slot e.g. for international travel to be able to use foreign networks for faster data and calls while abroad, you couldn’t. If you needed a second e-sim you have to have the phone paid outright AND the device must be used with T-mobile for at least 40 days according to T-mobile’s current policies. It’s not an issue if you added a second T-mobile line to the phone but good luck if you want to use it for travel outside Can or Mex. If you stick to the promo where T-mobile eventually pays off the cost of the phone over 2 years (via monthly credits), you would never be able to access the second e-sim unless you held on to your now 2yr old phone and chose not to upgrade. We have spent hours with customer service trying to explain our needs so that we can use the second e-sim slot: we paid off 2 iPhone 15s, we even said they could re-lock the phones after we added our foreign e-sim. Only under the threats of leaving T-mobile did we get contacts from higher level reps who have now promised us twice that they would unlock the phones. At the time of this review, we have still not gotten any results or updates within the timeframe of their “personal guarantees.” Meanwhile, we are living abroad with less than optimum T-mobile service (using their local partner network). Some local businesses and services we use here require a local number which we have (because we had local plans before we switched devices and plans) but can no longer use or access them since we can’t add the second e-sim.TLDR: International travelers beware. T-Mobile policies don’t make things easy. You can’t use the phone to its full potential. Customer service has not kept its promises.",0
I cancelled my service and have been waiting on a refund for 4 months. Each time I call I have to start from begining.,0
"I been with Tmobile for 21 years and now all of a sudden I'm having phone and billing issues,  I had the flip phone z4 or whatever an they said that I could trade it in for whatever phone I wanted,  I wanted the iPhone 15 of course they wouldn't have it until 3 months later so my ass got talked into the Samsung ultra 23. Had the phone now for a month and now it's a billing issue saying I couldn't trade the phone in due to I didn't pay the phone off,  a whole month, so the customer service representative saying I understand,  no the HELL YOU DON'T,  I wanted money taken off from buying a new phone. Tmobile SUCK ASS yes I'm mad",0
"I've been with Sprint for 11 years.  I have a business account with T Mobile and was expecting a smooth transition. however, I've only experienced horror. One of my phone lines returned in July a phone because of a warranty issue. sprint contacted T-Mobile to tell them that the phone was returned.  you would think that they would credit my account the $1,00+ fee. no way!!! they have disconnected my phone line over 16 times and threatened to permanently disconnect my phone because of a phone I no longer have.  after three supervisors and over 8 hours of customer service phone time there has been no resolution.  why is every time I call I have to retell my story from the beginning.  do they have notes are anything?  please give me my number so I can go to a real cell phone company.  I'm contemplating filing a lawsuit for lost revenue.",0
I went to T Mobile from a prepaid plan lol I repeat a prepaid plan. So after getting sold the brand spanking new Samsung s23 ultra for almost 2 grand. I started having issues not receiving my phone calls!!! My business is ran off my cell phone.  The technician at tmobile literally told me that the phone is junk. That every customer with the new s23s are all having these same issues!!!! GO TO VERIZON AND GET A GOOGLE PHONE OR A IPHONE. YOUR WELCOME.,0
"horrible. the manager refunds my account after I was told the money he refunded wouldn't be taken out. now they expect me to pay the money back for the money the manager refunded. they even told me to ask a family member to help me get the money, how rude is that. you really think they would have know not to tell a customer something like this. then after I told them I was leaving because they are horrible and help. they have the nerve to try and send a review on how my experience was. They need todo better with their customer service department.",0
Purchased a iPhone from them and they will not unlock my device have call them for the last 3 weeks they keep telling me it’s unlocked and it isn’t been without my phone for 3weeks,0
"Will never do business with t mobile again and will make sure everyone knows about our horrible experience. Not only was our coverage way worse than AT&T, but we also had a few customer services issues with them throughout our time. However, by far the worst was when we decided to leave them.Back story…when we decided to sign up with them they said “we’ll throw on a third line because there is a deal and it’s free anyways. You don’t ever have to use it but can if you decide down the line you’d like to” this was fine obviously. However when we cancelled we had forgotten about the third line and nobody mentioned it. The problem came when t mobile continued to charge us for our full bill…when we called they apologized and stated they would refund us. However the following month came around and we never received a refund and were charged AGAIN for a line we literally don’t even have active. Again we call and they apologized and finally refunded us the $280.This was until we were charged AGAIN…the people were never actually canceling the line. We went into the store and they now we’re saying we’d have to pay $140 for our “last month” again for a phone line we NEVER USED.We called again and nobody seems to want to resolve this despite telling us twice on the phone we would be refunded  and it was a mistake. To out of nowhere be like “you need to pay a last bill” after months of us contacting them is unacceptable.We will likely end up paying this bill for a phone line we never used.We absolutely without a doubt will never recommend t mobile to anyone and in fact we believe they will cheat you out of money anyway they can. Not worth it…definitely not worth it.",0
"I hate this company. I was not explained when I traded in my phone that I was agreeing to being stuck with the company for 24 months. The chat and phone agents are constantly giving misinformation. They have not been able to send me a copy of my contract they keep sending me a link that takes me to my profile dashboard. Their website sucks and their mobile app is even worse. A chat agent promised me that my phone was going to get unlocked in 72 hrs if I paid $142.94 because that is all that I owed on my device. 72 hrs later I called and they tell me the agent lied to me. They are applying a trade in promotion in 24 months for a trade in device they ALREADY RECEIVED! I am not sending them pieces of my trade in each month for 24 months. On top of that if I want out of the company they are asking me to pay over $400 dollars when I have already given them my previous device and got a credit for almost $800, I have been paying installments for many months and last Saturday a chat agent told me all I had to do was pay $142.94 if you all of that up it is $1001 for a phone that’s worth $1000 but because I want to leave the company because I hate it and I am unhappy they want to charge over $400 as punishment but they call it “promotion” for a device they already received. They shouldn’t force me to stay with them if I don’t want to. They also can’t give me a better price and I have been asking for months. I hate Tmobile and I will make sure I let every single person I talk to know about the horrible experience, how toxic they are forcing me to stay with them when I don’t want to, how much they’ve lied to me, how bad their website and mobile app is and how they want to steal money from me when I already paid my device in full. Even car loans allow you to pay your loan early. Tmobile would rather have a million unhappy customers against their will than let people leave the company without hating them. I HATE TMOBILE!",0
Worst provider. They cheat you on everything.They sell you stuff as free but you end up paying for them.,0
These incompetent morons are the worst. I've deactivated by account due to unacceptable service and they keep sending me final notice bills even tho I've been to a kiosk 3 times to verify that i don't owe a thing!I want to strangle the morons behind this annoying bs.Tired of wasting my free time dealing with these morons!,0
"After over 13 Years, NO ONE deserves this treatment. I asked for a more economical rate (July) they didn't provide a solution that could beat Xfinity mobile so I left. T-Mobile closed my access to my account immediately online. They began sending me bills and charged me from July, August, & September. I called to dispute charges stating that I wasn't a customer and wouldn't pay. The rep claimed they would cover to cost but I had to pay up until July-August; and all other charges would be dropped by T-mobile. I asked for written confirmation and didn't receive it. Fast forward to today, I have a new bill claiming $7.00 late fee for the remaining balance of over $120 which isn't included in the bill. Later, I receive a debt communication letter from a debt collector for the $120+ amount for a bill on November 9th. Now, how am I billed on November 9th and then sent to a debt collector within 2 weeks, I have no idea. I used to love them for the rates....but this has been a complete nightmare.....I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.",0

"T-Mobile, is a very shady place, been trying for over a month to get my refund, talked to about 10 customer service people and have been getting the run around, think twice before dealing with the clowns in customer service, I never been so pissed off, never would recommend these people to anyone ,Oct 4th and still no refund as of today Nov 18",0
Went to switch with them back in March. Same day I switched Verizon bought me back with a better deal and we canceled the plan.

Will never ever recommend them.,0
"Terrible costumer service!! Carlos is probably the worst t-Mobil representative to talk to. Very unprofessional, he was rude and he tried to make me feel stupid. Obviously he took it personal when I told him I had change all my lines to another company (I thought he was aware of) He, changed his mood immediately.                                 I, was calling because I supposed to have a refund. I switched to a dif company on November 8th and the cicle close the 18th. The payment it was automatic. The rep that help me to close my account (Juan, very nice guy) told me I will have a refund, but Carlos said I did not explain to them that I was closing the account, (it was obvious when they gave me the code to unlock the phones and switch companies) and  I will not receive a refund.

"When the iPhone 15 came out, T-Mobile gave a great offer. I was doubtful of their coverage in my area, and the salesperson told if there were any issues with coverage I could return the devices in 14 days totally free of charge. ""There will be no charges at all."" When the phone arrived, I could not even make a call from my home due to the bad signal. Made one call from outside to check and a few text messages (8 total in the USA), and used 36 MB of data to check the internet speed while outside. Found the signal was horrible in our area and returned all 3 devices! (Did not even open one packet). After a month and a half, I got a bill for $257.39. When called the support center at Phillipense, they told me I owed this bill and they could not do anything, as this is an automated bill. Spoke to the manager who said you have to pay or it will go to the collection agency. He also stated they cannot help with the bill as it is automated. I wondered why they have customer service for billing. Anyway, I paid the bill while with the manager who said the bill is only around $48 for 4-day charges for the lines they sent to test. I was using my Verizon phone all these times, glad I did not cancel it. After 4 days of paying the bill, got a letter from a collection agency telling me I owed T-Mobile $257.39. Can't believe this, as they never even sent me a first-time bill, and I had given my Credit for them to monthly charge me, which got canceled by them when they stopped my service. This was a horrible experience for me, and I would strongly suggest you keep away from testing their services, as they are going to charge you for the days. Don't believe the salesperson.",0

"Tmobile has one of the most disrespectful and incompetent employees, especially the call center located in India.  These individuals provide fake names, they love to hear themselves speak, lack listening and communication skills and have no customer service skills.  It appears that they use your call to practice their English.  The corporate office where one should be available to file a complaint, the representative transfers the call to a B.S. department, when you call back and request to speak to a supervisor, you are told that you are being reported for harassment and your call is blocked.  This is Tmobile mission statement- to provide disrespectful agents and a disservice, while you pay us.",0

"Back in about 2009 T-Mobile sold my personal information. As my contract was coming to an end I was contacted by phone by someone asking if I wanted to renew my contract. I went ahead assuming it was T-Mobile at the time, but it turned out to be '3' Mobile and I didn't realise they had sold my details until I read about it, and being naive about mobile phone companies, I thought that '3' were part of T-mobile. I only found out about the data being sold by reading about it in the papers at the time. Needless to say I haven't used T-mobile nor '3' mobile ever since. However, we are now in 2023 and I'm still receiving scam and spam emails from all the usual culprits at the rate of some 15-20 a day. It is so brazen that they always quote a reference number and guess what? It is is the last 9 digits of that original T-Mobile number I had so there is no escaping who is to blame. Beware they will sell your personal details! Also '3' Mobile need a mention too as they bought those stolen details, so don't trust them either. I've left this for so long but after all this time I've finally had enough and the fallout from a company that still drags on. Someone less aware will get stung no doubt further by the scam emails proliferation. I would have liked to have given no stars to both those companies",0
"Worst experience ever, they promised me 800$ in credit in an offer, then told me I didn’t qualified so all they would give was 400$ for my trade in, now that I want to pay whatever is left on my phone after a year they’re telling me my trade in was worth only 80$ bucks and the 320$ they “gave me” was the promotion which I wouldn’t qualified if I paid my phone before my 2 years contract, what a bullsh!t, they basically got my phone for free, worst scammers ever",0
"They lie!!! Said they have the best coverage. I can stand if front of my TV to hot spot and it still doesn't work. They slow down your data so you have to buy better and more expenses phone. I'm switching back to Walmart or the dollar store phone. They worked every where and all the time. Walmart has better plans and they worked everywhere. T mobile you suck big time and your over charged for service. They're so petty that they charged me accounts.20 cents and they can't tell me what's it for. If you take .20 cents from every costumer that works be almost  allot of money that they stole from us. They are so bad that I'm will to hurt my credit just to cancel. I hate this company and the people are dumb in the store. I should charge y'all the$5 dollars for convenience fee just to put up with your dumb asses. So no I highly recommend not to use t mobile here in Ada, server sucks here.",0
"I went to a local T mobile store after hours of useless conversations on the phone to eliminate my account (I have a new phone service) they charged my account after I dropped service with them. I wanted to be sure they could not asses my personal banking information.  Over the phone the agent told me to go to a physical store, show my license and then then could eliminate my account. I went to a location in Camillus NY (On West Genesee street) the manager refused to help me and told me he could not assist me.. the Manager was indifferent and extremely rude.. I did get resolution at the Costcos in Camillus location. but it took literally hours of calls and driving to two locations to get resolution. I will never do business with them again",0
T-Mobile like most other companies are using the OFFSHORE CALL CENTER REPRESENTATIVES. They are not trained and most unprofessional people on earth. They would misrepresent what you say and falsely claims and charge your credit cards for services you never received. I hope that the USA government sue all of these companies because we as customers are suffering….,0
Customer service was horrible.  My main screen went out and I followed the instructions for resets and even went to the store they recommended to run diagnostics on the phone which said the screen was defective.  I called back to get a replacement and the tech wanted me to to repeat everything again and go to a T mobile store.  The rep the day before said they would ship a new phone since I have insurance.Spent two hours on the phone. Very disappointed this was not resolved and will not be held hostage for two hours at a store like I was when I switched from ATT.  Buyer beware,0
"We had to cancel our t-mobile internet because the service was awful in our area. I was told I would get an email with a shipping label attached to return the router.  I received the email but with no shipping label attached. Tonight I spent two hours on hold and still don’t have an email with a shipping label. The last person that I spoke with told me I would have it within three hours. That was six hours ago, so I assume I won’t receive it. I believe this is t-mobile’s way of being able to charge the customer for non-returned equipment.  Long story short……buyer beware.",0
I would give them zero stars if I could. Switched 6 weeks ago and totally regret it. Customer service is not knowledgeable. You will spend hours on the phone with them and get a million different responses depending upon who you talk to. My account was never opened correctly. My employer discount would not be applied even though they said at the beginning it would. I will stay though my phone trade in credits then leave this horrendous company. Beware.,0
There customers service is the worst and they lie they told me my order was coming November 6th lied about that promised me a lot of stuff lied now I have to wait until November 8th which I won’t be home I hope my people at my house can sign for it if not I’m done with t mobile den they didn’t care they was going to send my phone back either way if I didn’t except it something needs to be done with this company,0
"I went to a T-mobile store in Bellevue PA and was promised one thing and then after I paid money, said that they wouldn't honor their offer and that I had to pay more after I confirmed the terms of the offer many times.  When I called T-mobile for help, they promised I would receive calls back from the store and from a supervisor but no calls ever came.  I called 4 times with the same promise each time. Every time I called, I got different information.  I am looking to move to a new carrier now.",0
"Just got a text, if the payment method is cc, you will jot get the auto payment discount. How low can this company go, just the greed at the C suite level is horrendous. They are not cheaper than anyone else, just a bad bad company.",0
"T-Mobile’s in-store customer service left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. I visited the store to replace my internet router, but the staff refused to help me, claiming that the router was defective and that replacing it would hurt their numbers. They told me I would have to go to corporate or mail it in and wait for it to be shipped. I explained that I needed internet right away and couldn’t be without it for several days, but they still refused to help. I have a business account with 12 lines, but they didn’t seem to care about my needs. The customer service specialist was rude and unhelpful, and I was left without internet for several days.I would not recommend this store to anyone. The in-store customer service is terrible, and the staff doesn’t seem to care about their customers’ needs. I plan to reach out to T-Mobile’s corporate team and management to file a complaint about this store and its poor customer service. I hope that T-Mobile will take steps to improve its in-store customer service so that other customers don’t have to go through the same frustrating experience that I did.",0
"Stay away from this company their billing practices boarder on criminal!  My closing date for my account was 10/11/23.  They charge ahead for their services so when I canceled on 10/12/23 I figured I would be refunded for all $60 - less 1 or 2 days.  Today I get another bill for $60(11/4/23)!  I called T-Mobile billing & was told ""yes bill is pay ahead.  Because I did not cancel before start of new cycle I am responsible for the full month""!!!  What type of customer service is this! Now I am paying double for my service, because new & better customer service company Consumer Cellular, charges after use!Again STAY AWAY FROM TMOBILE THEY ARE NOT A REPUTABLE COMPANY PUNISH YOU FOR DECONTINUING THEY PLANS!!!",0
"Don't go to tmobile, they are liars and don't know what information they are advertising!  I had an account with ATT for 10+ years and I was getting charged over $400/month for tv, internet, and phone.  I went up to midtown plaza to tmobile when the store was there to switch my provider.  Gabby, the store manager, assisted me.  She told me I could switch over to t-mobile for a lot cheaper for all services and I could trade my ATT phones and they would be all paid off, in full.  I had two phones from ATT, an iphone and an android that I traded in.  No further instruction was given, they said they would take care of it, and received a confirmation email of the same!  4 months later, I am getting a bill from ATT that I owe for the phones that were switched over, over $1000.00!  I kept calling Gabby and she kept saying she would look into it.  After several months, now I am in collections and my credit that I worked so hard to get back up, is ruined.  Apparently, Gabby, keep in mind she is a manager, had the wrong information.  Because I was on a payment plan, the phones were not eligible for this program!  Shouldn't a manger know this?  After all the back and forth, and finally finding this out, btw, noone knew this info up front, I attempted to call Gabby again, but this time, no response.  Why?  Because she was wrong, made a mistake and she couldn't fix it.  First of all, if you are a manager, you should know the policy and how the programs work.  Then, when you made the mistake, you fix it one way or another!  It didn't matter to her, she made her money and I am in collections ruining my good credit!  This shouldn't be allowed.  I was a nurse and if I gave someone the wrong info, guess what, people could lose their lives.  Obviously not the same thing, but the main point is, is that if you have a job, you do it, you do it well, you do it right or you get fired or you are screwing someone else's finances or lives or what not.  DO NOT go to tmobile, they dont have the correct information or everyone isn't on the same page!  All they care about is making their profit.  This shouldn't be allowed.  There is NO excuse!!!! A manager like this does not deserve to be a manager!  I will be cancelling my account, they don't even care to lose a customer.  Oh well, maybe that's why the store that I originally went to closed, they SUCK.  Have all the information, paperwork, etc you need when you open account with anyone.  Because when you get screwed in the end, you better have your ducks in a row because they change up their story to cover their asses.  I know she will get this review and I hope her manager fires her for the crappy manager she is!",0
"In my opinion, T-Mobile is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Sprint was transferred to Tmobile. I’ve noticed that anytime I call it’s always a 2 to 3 hour ordeal to get anything fixed, that’s if they fix it at all.My advice to anyone switching to a different plan is be prepared to pay quite a bit of money because they do not keep track of the account that you’re transferring your plan from. They don’t even know how to look it up. We switched from our business account to a 55+ account and without our knowledge they put it into a plus premium which charged us $60 more a month. Took hours to get that fixed. Also, after switching the account to the 55+ plan I paid it immediately but little to my knowledge did I know that the previous plan we were on had also billed us  Which is OK but they did not tell us about it and I found out that it was going to be turned over to collection. Tmobile needs to put all their billing access together rather than separately. When switching over the account, they did not tell us that we still owed money on our pre-contracted phones, which caused my phone to be locked so I could not even transfer to a different service without going through all the hassle of calling over and over. When I found out that we owed money for our contract phones, I immediately paid that and it still took hours and hours and hours of calling to get my phone unlocked, I am no longer a T-Mobile customer, but I would say that is the worst customer service that I have ever had to deal with. I would not recommend TMobile to anyone.",0
"I have two choices for internet where I live. The only other service is constantly broken, and does not provide even the 'guaranteed' 20Mb/s they promise. T-Mobile REFUSES TO HONOR any Affordable Connectivity Program (federal) discounts. They do not tell you this upfront, and they do not offer any other options. You cannot even lodge an official complaint with anyone. If you are disabled, and every dollar counts, DO NOT SWITCH TO T-Mobile. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.",0
"5G wireless for $50 sounds great, right? And guaranteed services! T-mobile wifi drops every time a fighter jet or plain flying over my house! Every day at random times their router would turn off and reboot constantly. After seeking T-mobile assistance for weeks they ""had no idea why their router"" kept messing up. Everyone from the services department kept saying how amazing the speed was???  Again the speed was not an issue. Not having an internet connection that they guaranteed was the problem. How is the router dropping off and on all day long when they had two 5G towers in front and back of our house? T-Mobile did NOT account for the most extensive Air Force Base, and their air runways are directly over us. Hello, the Air Force Fighter Jets have the equipment to block radio waves/5G! We never had a single person from T-Mobile help. Their guaranteed wifi was a lie. We paid them for months with their guarantees they could solve this issue; ⚠️ We Kept getting the runaround. I was distraught and never refunded anything even though I was guaranteed service🤬 Do NOT get their 5G!!!",0
"ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE! T-Mobile uses Assurant Insurance, which has their customer service department in the Phillipines. They do not speak English well. They are super disorganized. I spent more than 5 HOURS ON THE PHONE trying to process a damaged PHONE CLAIM. Even the supervisors would hang up on me and not call me back. They even shipped me a label that was inactive so I was informed by the USPS that because the Assurant shipping label did not work I had to pay to ship the device. I contacted Assurant and they said that they would not reimburse me. The agent said that they do not have a Tax ID number. This has to be the MOST INCOMPETENT COMPANY that I have ever come across. Choose a cel phone carrier that does not use Assurant Insurance. It is extremely stressful and time consuming to process claims with them.",0
"T-mobile is so bad that literally every other email I send from my phone will not go through and I have to re-create the email and resend it.  And it is not anything to do with the email server because I have four email accounts and it happens on all of them with T-Mobile. The only reason I keep them is because their service actually works really well overseas but God help you if you want to send an email in the United States from your phone.  If you are not a world traveler, get a different cell phone company.",0
"Where do I start?  First of all T-Mobile ""free phones"" is crap they are obselete phones that stopped being produced in 2021.  I went thru 3 one plus nord in 6 months.  For a whole week I had no phone bc this garbage freezes Everytime I open an app.  One rep will state one thing and when you call back there is a completely different story.  But they do ""apologize for the inconvenience"". If I hear that one more time I'm gonna spit.  So instead of giving a different phone that like you know works.  They wanted to give me a fourth one plus nord.  And nothing is free with T-Mobile. You can't upgrade for one year bc they give you a $11.75 ""credit"" so is it really free. No you pay for it in the long run.  And their customer service is the worst I have ever seen in any company.  Maybe Humana could stop by and do some training.  Any training would be better than what they are dishing out now for $75/line.  It's garbage nothing but garbage.  This is just another bad review.  Keep reading there are thousands of these.",0
"I recently went to a T-Mobile store to get New phones ,I asked if there were any  promotions available  they said yes, So they came up with 2 Samsung Galaxy Phones And two, Samsung Galaxy, Watches, they said it was all promotions, OK By the time I left the store. I paid out $295. I also got there home internet.So I inquired later on how much I would be paying monthly for all this good stuff.I was told.  $256 a month. I asked why show much.I was not informed by the store how much so they told me. 8 lines you're paying for I said. I only have 2 phones And 2 watches They said I had 8 lines . I got screwed by the people at the store and person I talk to on the phone. The guy I said I was getting a good deal. Cost each phone, Was $800.But I got it for free. That's a bunch of Bull c***.",0
"Approximately 4 years ago I purchased a 2 galaxy watches with T-Mobile. one of the watches was damaged and T-Mobile exchanged it for another watch and that required opening another account. The store clerk assured me that the first account would be canceled., After receiving my first bill I noticed I was now being charged for the 3 watches they are under wearables in the T-Mobile bill statement. I called again to explained that I only had 2 watches and the extra line they charged for was no longer owned by me. They said they would refund me and cancel. I trusted T-Mobile with that. So today October 31, 2023 I decided to check my bill and noticed T-Mobile was still charging me for that 3rd line (wearable). I reached out to customer service and they said they have canceled it and that they would only refund me $30. I brought up the fact that they owe me about 4 years worth, so they flipped it on me saying I should have checked my bill monthly and called them and they cant go back that far. Why after multiple attempts to cancel and being told it was taking care of I should have to keep calling about the same issue. I trusted the problem to be solved. I been a customer for about 20 years. I'm so disappointed in T-Mobile. I added a line about a a few months ago and was told I get a free phone and then they said no free phone because of my plan. T-Mobile you treating your faithful customers that been with you for over 10 years like crap. I should be refunded for the watch.",0
T-Mobile's service is literally so bad that every time I send an email from my phone I can count on 1 or 2 not going thru and having to recompose and resend. Just garbage reception and customer service,0
"All I can honestly say is, they are not an honest company and you would be better to pay off any equipment that you have, albeit expensive in the time, but worth it in the end. Go, matter of fact, run to a different company. They are not an honest company. Nor do they care.",0
"I recently signed up for TMobile service because the rep at Walmart lured me in with a deal on the phone.  Never again!  I have tried to deal with customer service, and it is horrible.  Long massive wait times on hold speaking with people from the other side of the world who do not know what they're doing.  This is the first and LAST month of service I use with them.  They need to fix their staffing problems and stop abusing customers with long hold times with incompetent people who do not know how to solve issues.",0
"I been charge on my bank account 279 for not returning box when I did it so it’s been 3 months since then keep charge and when I call them says they will gimme a credit for it an this mont my bill it’s again almost 300 hundred dollars, ever time I call I have to explain why they shouldn’t charge me that money cuz I already send the box and tell them the route number and they gimme the confirmation that they get the box it’s been frustrated, why every time I call I have to spend 30 minutes explaining that they overcharge me.",0
"Waited on hold for over two hours for a supervisor only to keep it in transferred to a different customer service rep disconnected by representative twice. Very rude and unprofessional, promised follow up which did not happen. Over all very appalling conversations and no resolution.",0
"They deserve  a negative, they say keep and switch. It is totally  bait and switch. Lied about everything. 3 of us changed to t mobile. And it has been completely  horrible since the start.  Pay off your phone/ good luck on that. Took 6 months of countless emails and calls to get them to pay off my phone.  Said $240 each on costco gift cards. We got 2 for $75.  Our service  area has went from bad with Verizon  to horrible with Tmobile.     Will tell you your not an authorized  customer. How can you not be an authorized  customer  when you have an account with them????  I now tell everyone to stay completely  away from T mobile  it is that horrible!!!!!",0
The worst customer service ever. Sprint was much better.,0
"I have had a very bad experience with T-Mobile right from the get-go. They're employed lied to me and I have been lied to for the last 2 weeks. They have my phone I have no refund. I'm disabled on disability, they basically ripped me off. When An employee tells you that your refund will be on your card by Monday, and you talk to somebody else on monday. And they say he shouldn't ever said that. Aren't they supposed to honor what they say? But any business that Hires other people from a different country. And doesn't keep our money in our country shame on you.",0
I upgraded with T-Mobile and did not receive the device.  Multiple people callled me to wait an entire day for delivery - it never came they put me on hold for more than 30 minutes and asked me to pay deposit again and then wanted to charge me again.  Worst service in th world,0
I'd give a zero if I could. there accounting is all messed up their phone serve ice is shotty and drops. I get a collection letter then the rep says ignore the collection letter but there is a balance owed different form the collection letter. this is after they send me a final bill to close out the account of a different amount.,0
"Our old phone carrier shut down so we were forced to change carriers. I went to a T-Mobile store in Maize, KS and Maria, the lady that helped me, told me we would definitely have 5G coverage where we live. I questioned her about that several times during our interaction because my husband and I live very rural and when I looked at the coverage map before heading into the store, coverage looked spotty. She kept telling me we would FOR SURE have 5G coverage. I didn't purchase a new phone until I knew it would work at our house. After a couple weeks, I decided to purchase a new device with them because we at least had 4G coverage. Then, shortly after the 14 day return period expired, our service is almost nonexistent. I called customer service and the guy I spoke to informed me that he would have never sold us a plan and phones because his map showed almost no coverage where we live. He told me that we basically get ""left over"" signals from a tower that is very far away from us and the reason we don't have service now is because they were having problems with said tower. I asked when the tower was going to be up and he said he didn't know. Now, we don't get service, thank goodness we have wifi or my new expensive phone (that they won't let me pay off early or return) would be a paper weight. The only way out from under them now is to pay off mine and my husband's devices at full retail pricing, not just the sale pricing. My husband's phone hasn't even left the box, but we can't return it. I asked the customer service guy if there's anything we can do since we don't have service and he said, ""No, nothing."" So basically we have to pay ridiculous prices to them but our phones only work on wifi, that we also have to pay for. I'm extremely disappointed with T-Mobile. We'll be switching to Verizon as soon as we're able to.",0
"T-Mobile Money are Employees are a compulsive liars, habitual liars, pathological liars, scammers, Ponzi schemers. They are very inconsiderate. They were close customers are pills for no reason. You file disputes, they think your threat for filing disputes and/or too many disputes. Because they figured out that someone was stealing your identity and stealing your money from the card. So then they came to a decision to close your account. I don’t recommend T-Mobile Money. Stay away from these careless morons",0
"Very upset with T mobile now. Got a text saying my service was going to be disconnected for no payment. Not sure how that can be considering I am on autopay. They are saying a payment from July 27, 2023 was returned. Why did it take over three months for them to contact me and now they will not let me pay my bill with a credit card, has to be a checking account and I do not give anyone my banking info. So in morning go phone shopping (mostl likely xfinity). Obviously over 15 years of service with Sprint don't mean anything to Tmobile.1mReply",0
HorribleWe haven’t even been with them a month & I want to leave which I would if it wouldn’t effect credit. I will only list a few things 1st they lied in store we switched over from our another company which we liked only reason we switched was due to the in store customer service at location near us. ((I regret leaving now) they offered us a great deal on phones watches etc the one watch they did not have at the moment gentlemen helping us said come back Thursday(was Tuesday we were there) offer will still be good we can override the fee u will get watch for same price which was $26 so we got the one went back Thursday get to the second watch all of a sudden things changed can’t do it wanted well over $100 which I would of if they said that but I was pissed and they should of honored it like they said so I left annoyed.So that was that then they still set watch up and had linked to our phone yet never received watch was a biotch to get that corrected couldn’t do it in the store(of course) and customer service kept telling us it was in the mail was not understanding we didn’t get the watch it was not being sent etc. u can tell they r reading a script and have no real knowledge of anything majority of the time. so I should of known that the bad taste was going to continue to linger. I feel the service is horrible got new iphone 1/2 stuff don’t work can’t connect. I had a refurbished older version iPhone and had way better connection before . I would not recommend this company to anyone I heard so many bad things since this company has been out I stayed away due to that reason for many years. We decided give it a try plus they lured us in with the great deal should of stayed away big mistake. Like I said hasn’t even been a full month and on top of all this I’m paying almost $200 a month more to be miserable and in happy with service and not being able to use all the functions cause connection blows. If thinking about switching please do yourself a favor don’t. I never write reviews ever but I had to if this helps even 1 person. Don’t make same mistake cause I’m stuck now. I wish I could give it a positive one i at the moment have not one positive thing to say except they are good liars.,0
"One might guess that the Customer ""Service"" folks at T-Mobile CHAT....or the phone employees...are taught to LIE and make promises that none of them follow thru on.",0
I think T-Mobile customer service is wonderful I've never had any problem with them for the last 21 years period however T-Mobile has decided to block me from customer service. I can't call there if I call there I get put on eternal hole. Most of the time I can't get into my T-Mobile or T-Mobile to see the billing or to try and chat with someone. If I call from another phone I can get through or I did get through now they've caught that and it started blocki.ng me using someone else's phone. Oh well I forgot to mention T-Mobile's billing I thought was perfect for every charge there is a date and an explanation I have been having two charges with no explanation of what it's for. And the problem with accessing my my T-Mobile or T-Mobile so that I can watch the account during the month is a problem for me so I will be saying goodbye and I hope that just that this does not happen to anyone else,0
My sister had just got out of high school in 2019 and  went with T- mobile and she was happy with them. I meant her for lunch then went to T- mobile in October 2021 to upgrade her phone. She talked me into switching fromAT&T to T- Mobile I finally agreed. I told the rep I would pay in full for my new phone. He then suggested i trade in my current phone for ($400) iPhone 8 Plus I said okay what’s my balance? He told me I would have to wait 60 days before my old phone would post on my account. What he didn’t tell me was they pro- rate that amount over two years 90 days in I try to pay the balance off and they had only applied $40 dollars to my account. I was so mad that I called them up and asked for my phone back and told them I would pay that 40 dollars but they said they couldn’t do that. I paid the bill for the next 20 months on time in full . I called them to ask my balance because I was moving to somewhere else. They fail to tell me that I had a $ 40 credit before I ported my number over and sent me a bill after that and told me they didn’t have to give me that  credit. So please be careful when trading in your phones when you take good care of them like I do …,0
"I've been a TMobile customer for over 20 years, since it was Aerial, back in 1997.For more than 6 months, I've been paying late fees because my payment due date was originally the 13th of each month and I usually make my payment when I get paid on the 15th of each month. In August, I contacted TMobile Customer Service  to request my payment due date to be changed to at least the 15th of each month. For my surprise, after I was informed that the change was made, the following bill (September) was still reflecting the 10th as the due date for the payments. I patiently contacted TMobile Customer Service once again and supposedly, the issue was resolved, but I still had to pay the late charges. When I received the notification for the October payment, once again, the due date reflected is the 10th. I contacted TMobile again and I was given a credit so ok. I was also explained that I could schedule a payment on October 15th or 16th, as a payment arrangement, and that the November payment was to be due as requested, on or after the 15th of each month. For my surprise, and once again, I just received the notification about my bill with a due date of 11/10th and this time the total amount due is $20 higher than the last amount paid.I contacted customer service once again, this time yelling and screaming to whom identified himself as a Supervisor, Brandon, who stated that he was able to change the due date but I will still be responsible to pay the November bill on the 10th. He offered a $20 credit (A JOKE, AN INSULT) as damage control. Ridiculous.I'm not asking for $20.  I'm asking to get the due date fixed. I feel it is unfair that after over 20 years of paying on time, I need to keep paying late fees due to the incompetency of the TMobile's staff, where nobody seems to be able to make a simple change to an account. As a mortgage loan processor, I know the importance of paying on time; however, looks like TMobile is unwilling to help in order to keep collecting late fees.",0

After reiterating the story multiple times with agents and a supervisor I was assured (with confirmations) the refund would arrive. It Never came. Request began in August.

"On October 7, 2023 I went to a T-Mobile store located at 100 Viewmont Mall 842, Scranton, PA 18508. I went into the store and HUNTER helped me. Hunter told me about a promotion and a trade in value. Hunter asserted to me and multiple other people including the account owner that the promotion they were running was for $350.00 PLUS IN ADDITION the trade in value of the old phone which was valued at $260.00 for a total of $610.00 being applied to the new phone making the installment payments a total of $24.58 monthly. On October 12, 2023 the phone was received and I was to do the deferred trade in for the old phone. Went to a T-mobile store near home and was told that the information I had was inaccurate and I should call the store that provided that information. On October 14, 2023, I spoke to a representative named Jennifer over the phone (recorded calls) and explained the situation, she promised me a call back Monday October 16, 2023. THIS CALL NEVER OCCURRED BECAUSE SHE NEVER CALLED ME On October 16, 2023 after failure by Jennifer to call me back I called again and was transferred to Nadia another rep. I explained the situation to her and because of the situation she sent me to her Supervisor Danielle. Danielle said that there was nothing they could do to honor the price the EMPLOYEE gave me on October 7, 2023. T-mobile's employee misrepresented the terms of the promotion to MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN RELIANCE THE MISREPRESENTED TERMS THE AGREEMENT WAS AGREED TO TMOBILE DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THERE OWN EMPLOYEE'S ERRORS. To put into context, there was misinformation provided by TMOBILE'S EMPLOYEE who they TRAIN and who they are RESPONSIBLE FOR. As a result of the inaccurate information my payments are higher for the new phone then what was represented to me on October 7, 2023. I tried to speak with TMOBILE and they refuse to rectify the situation saying they cannot do anything about it. After 13 years I believe it is time to leave.",0
"We had T-Mobile internet service for 19 months.  The T-Mobile service at the beginning was pretty good, with the service freezing needing a restart only about once a week. However, the towards the end in August of 2023, the gateway(modem) needed to be restarted several times a day in order to function. Around the same time T-Mobile removed the $5 discount for auto pay if you were using a credit card. Something they had allowed for over a year. On Aug 23rd we ordered Xfinity. The Xfinity gateway would be delivered in several days. On Aug 24th, 2023 I called customer service and told them I wished to cancel. However, customer service said I needed to try a new gateway first to see if that would correct the problem. I figured I would compare them both. T-Mobile sent a replacement quickly, but it did not do much better with Mbps download of 44.  The Xfinity gateway came a few days later with Mbps in the 400's for downloads without any problems. I canceled T-Mobile service on Sept 2, 23 through their customer service. When canceling they requested the 6 digit number that I gave them when I signed up 19 months earlier.  I gave them the number I had written down in my T-Mobile file. The customer service rep said it was the wrong number. I said that is the one I uses. They said it was imperative that I give them the 6-digit code.  I asked if they could use my soc sec number or email me a reset and they said no. They said that I would have to physically go to a T-Mobile store and request my 6-digit number after they verified my identity.  I drove to the nearest store located at 2024 IL-50 Ste A1, Bourbonnais IL 60914 and spoke with a rep named Michael.  He said he could not give me the 6-digit number and told me to call customer service back and tell them so. I went home and called and told them what he said, and they said okay and that they would email a return label for the gateway.  I received the email with the label on September 2nd, 2023 and returned the gateway to UPS. T-Mobile received the gateway on Sept 11 23.  I received a letter stating that ""They received the gateway, and no further action is needed on your part."" Then on Sept 19, 23 T-Mobile collected an auto pay of $55 from my credit card on file.  I called my credit card to dispute the charge.  T-Mobile sent me a new bill asking for the $55, plus $25 for a chargeback, Plus the next months $55 for a total of $135.  I called customer service on Oct 7, 23, and they said I needed to go to an actual store because they could not help me again because of the 6-digit pin saying the one I gave them was incorrect. I went to the store in Bradley Il and they told me that the account had never been canceled, even though customer service sent the return label and had received the gateway. The store contacted T-mobile customer service from their store and eventually a very rude corporate manager named Patrick said that they insisted I pay the full $135.  I explained I had cancelled the service on Sept 2, 23 and returned the gateway.  He said it was T-Mobiles' policy to have you also physically come to the store to cancel and that it wasn't officially canceled until that day which was over a month later. I told him I physically went to the T-Mobile store but Michael would not give me the pin.  He scolded me saying I should have used the phrase ""I wish to have you cancel my account"" I explained that I had already done that with customer service rep on the phone and that I had told Michael that I needed the pin number for them to cancel it. Patrick from Corporate says that I am repeating myself and it was my fault for not saying that I wanted Michael to cancel the account.  He then said that he would offer me a one-time deal that he would forgive the last months charge and that he was being very gracious in doing so.  I again told him I didn't even have a gateway to use the service and that T-Mobile had it after sending me the return email and label. He again said it was never fully canceled to their satisfaction whatever that means.  We went round and round until I said I would pay $55 for the month I disputed even though I had canceled the service just to end the madness. He said he also insisted on the $25. I said no and that I wanted to only pay $55 only on that day.  He said it would cost an additional $10 to have an operator take my payment.  I asked if I could do it online without a charge and he said yes but it would not give me a confirmation.  Because he was not helpful at all we ended the call.  I went home and paid $55 online and still received a confirmation number. It seemed that Patrick was trying to squeeze even more money from me. The amount of time and effort I have put into resolving this is ridicules. There appears to be no training for customer service either at the store level or at corporate.Update 10/15/23  T-Mobile reached out and we reached a mutual understanding.",0
for starters they suspended my account and when i contacted them they said it was “accidental” and unsuspended it. not to bad but then i couldn’t change my plan or view any other plans in app. i opened a triuble ticket and nothing happened so i was stuck with my call/text unlimited only. NO DATA and then the next month i got charged 466 dollars for data roaming and using excessive data when i had NO DATA and 0 BYTES USED. contacted customer support and got told nothing they could do and then they recommended upgrading my plan and getting their home internet. this company is terrible and a scam. don’t recommend,0
"I was trying to purchase one of there Military Plans and was quoted a specific rate including trade in for 3 phone at no cost. A glitch in getting me a docusign agreement to sign was the beginning of my problems. The original rep who was going to fix it never called back. The next rep was going to check but never called back. The next rep sent me to a local store that was unable to help me. The next rep said they could fix it but it would take 24 hours and someone would call me, which they did. That rep however advised me that the plan I was quoted (and verified with each rep along the way did not exist and i would have to pay an additional $30 per month to get the phones i wanted. I then spoke to a supervisor who told me the same thing. So, multiple hours over 4 days wasted.",0
"Ranks at the very bottom of my experiences over the past 55 years with companies.  Three weeks ago, we contacted T-Mobile about upgrading our cell phones to newer models.  We currently have 7 lines with T-Mobile and all but one of our cell phones is paid off.  I cannot get a quote or straight answer, despite spending more than 4 hours and 5 different reps.  We're ready to switch to AT&T or Verizon!",0
"I have had T-mobile for seven years and never had a problem other than the service sucks in a lot of areas. But now they have outsourced thier customer service to another country and they can't even help you, I am not even sure you can get someone in America any more , I will be switching to spectrum",0
Just junk reception. Literally 15-18 emails come thru at once a lot of the time because of poor reception.,0
"T-Mobile will increase your bill after you sign a contract. Then they won't credit your account because their hands are tied. If you have any other options for phone service, use them first.",0
Very unethical business practices. As a 20 year customer (Sprint/TMobile)  Made a payment arrangement. Employee failed to note. Phone was turned off causing numerous problems. Management refused to own employees mistake. Don’t trust this company. I don’t feel they care about the customer.,0
One hour holds. Not helping customers with their issues. This is the T-Mobile way.,0
"I have been with T-Mobile seven years and I always have a payment arrangement every month because I’m a senior citizen on a fixed income .I was not able to keep the payment arrangement and only needed it to be extended by one day, which is  24 hours and they weren’t willing to accommodate me at all after seven years this is the first time they’ve ever denied me an extension!! I guess because they’ve gotten the monopoly on cell phone companies  now and all they are concerned with is making money. Thank God I don’t have a contract with them and I will never get another contract with them and as far as purchasing iPhone 15’s I will definitely be purchasing them through another company . This company offers No empathy at all,  no care or concern, and the managers are the worst.",0
I was told that my account was canceled multiple times and it wasn't. They continue to demand payment and refuse to work with me. It takes a lot of time to get a hold of a customer service rep. When I do they contradict each other and are pretty much completely unhelpful. A total nightmare to deal with. Just go with a different provider.,0
"I just got mobile service and continue to drop calls. My internet box never worked. My phone was hacked first month and I had 4 gran taken out of my bank acct. Viruses, they nickel and dine u, only want to help u if u buying something.",0
TMobile Customer Service Stinks.  I was on hold over hour and a half which is totally unacceptable.  I am going to consider changing my service because customer service is as much important.  They treat you as though once your a customer its ok to slack in other areas but so not the case.,0
"I have been with Sprint for 20+ years now T-Mobile. I was shopping to see if I should switch to ATT with my wife's legacy plan or have her move with me on my Sprint legacy plan. I called the T-Mobile customer services line as I was shopping for rates they told me that I would get a 20% discount if I went to a different plan and I could add my wife. They send me a link I fill out the information. T-Mobile sent me an email to call they confirmed it's 15%. As I was ready to switch the contract, I double-checked I called the number again 877-384-0296, and yet again they said yes it's 15% and I am eligible for it. After they switched me to a more expensive plan there was no 15% discount, I called them and they said they apologized but I am not eligible for the 15% discount. I have spent hours on the phone they refused to pull the recording and listen to it to honor what they told me twice. I am currently looking to leave T-Mobile as it has been a nightmare for me since they bought Sprint. I highly recommend you do not do business with companies that do not honor their words especially when you have been with them for 20 years. I am looking to exit my contract with them and sign up with a different carrier. Haresh P.",0
"T-MOBILE  isn't a the phone company you will want to us. While we used them we had nothing but issues and costumer service couldn't ever fix the problem. Once we canceled with them we found out they had been charging us for an additional line the whole time. It's now been 3 month after closing our account and they again took money from our account. We spoke to two different managers and one says we still owed money (which we dont) and the other says ""I see everything is paid in full and I'm not sure why we took another payment. We can reimburse you, however, it's going to take about 60 days.""We will never use T-MOBILE  again!",0
"THEY ARE NOTHING BUT LIARS! Their advertising is false, they DETEST THE MILITARY, they do not stand by their products, & their customer service, especially Shane, will lie from the first word out of their mouths! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BUSINESS!!! Oh & the read from a scripts & just keep at it. Liars, all of them!",0
"Customer service is in a different country than where I'm at, U.S. They don't know the US and they couldn't find my address in Vermont. And it took them 40 minutes on hold to find the nearest T-MOBILE store in Burlington (after I gave them the location). I found it on Google maps in 3 minutes but stayed on hold until they found it. So bad.",0
T-Mobile is a fraud and criminals. I traded in my new phone and they didn’t meet the deal they promised. They cancelled the contract and I had to call every month to get a credit. They stole my phone and then wouldn’t give me my monthly credit. I ended up having to pay for the phone outright and move to Verizon. Do not ever use Tmobile services!,0
First Time Dealing With Customer Service Where The Employees Seemed To Not Have A Solution To Anything Or They Was Just Guessing At It But It Started From Me Trying To File A Claim On My Phone Because I Couldn’t Call My Girlfriend Unless We Was Connected To The Same Wi-Fi And They Ran Test And It Was Something To Do With The Phone So I Went Through With The Claim People And The Man Told Me All I Had To Do Was Take The Phone In Store He Already Sent My Info And They Would Switch It Out Which Wasn’t The Case At All And On Top Of That I Had Sent My Black Iphone Back Still New Damn Near No Scratches Nothing Never Drop Water Damage Nothing I Get To The Store To Pick Up My New Phone And It’s White Which They Didn’t Tell Me Before Hand So The Woman Ask If I Wnated To Wait I Could Return This One And I’m Literally Done With Them At This Point Before Hand To Even Get The Clain The Customer Service Calls Getting Nothing But Disappointment Because The First Rep Told Me They Noted Everything Down So If The Steps Didn’t Work If I Had To Call Back It Would Already Show We Did All The Trouble Shooting And Just To Send Me To The Claims Department Just To Find Out Nothing Was Noted So I’m Trying To Explain To The Man I Just Want To Take Out The Claim I’ve Already Did All The Steps Which I Get Hung Up On After Him Saying He Was Going To Transfer For The Line And To Make A Long Story Short It Seemed That They Hired The First People They Step Out Side And Seen Like It Was Horrible I’ve Never Felt Disrespected By A Company As Much As I Did By Them It Was Like No Concern About My Issue At All But I Ended Up Suing Them And Not Even Getting What Was Agreed By Choice Because It Wasn’t More So About The Money With Me But The Lack Of Service That Many People Pay For That Wasn't Met if Your Going To Run A Billion Dollar Company At least Pay For Some Employees That’s Going To Keep A Business Looking Good Not Ones That’s Going To Get You A Lawsuit,0
"Tmobile did not have my correct email address om file and when I had fraud detected from my bank account my automatic payments were no longer going thru to Tmobile, however they sent the alerts only to a bad email address and waited 3 months before my service was shut ff which alerted me to the need to update my auto payment. I have since paid over $500 per month due to all of the reconnect fees that my bill is consistently over $1000 a month regardless if I contact them prior to the phones being shut off and then I am promised that no fees will be assessed buy then the next person I talk to tells me the reason it is so high is due to the fees and then they promise me to not chargeE but do anyways. And then proceed to shut my phone service off again 2 weeks after I've just paid them over $500!!!In addition I had insurance on each line because 2 of them are for children.  My 10 year old first lost his phone and thr claim was denied for fraud and I could not speak to anyone with the knowledge of how or why my claim was fraud. I then got him another phone I paid for out of pocket and then he broke the screen amd again insurance said it was fraud and would not replace it. I requested tmobike to cancel my insurance on every line and to reimburse me of each month I have paid for insurance ewhen I have been denied my coverage.And now my phone is shut off every two weeks without fail regardless that I am paying about $500 every 2 weeks for 4 phone lines!!DO NOT GO THROUGH TMOBILE!! THEY ARE LIARS AND WILL NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH PROGRAMS SUCJ AS INSURANCE THAT HOU PAY MONTHLY FOR BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE NOR EVEN GET AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IT IS SUPPOSEDLY FRAUD!WILL NEVER RECCOMMENE TMOBILE THEY ARE A SCAM AND A HORRIBLE COMPANY WHO WILL CONTINUOISLY ROB PEOPLE BLIND AND SMILE WHILE THEY DO IT!!",0

The device is locked and cripples the  dual sim feature especially when traveling. The customer support advised to get another phone for travel. So sad!,0
"The customer service aspect of t-mobile is not any better than it was 5 years ago.For those considering a switch to T-Mobile internet, you may want to give it caredul thought.The service may be shutting down orpossibly throttled late in the evening. However, I can not identify if it is the internwt service, a third party service platform ir a particular program.T-Mobile offers the ""perk"" of Paramount+ Showtime. The perk part of it is only the convenience of billing through T-Mobile. I am thinking the benefit runs to T- Mobile rather than the customer.Paramount promises local channels. For CBS, I can access TX, CA, GA,BOS, PA, MO, FL and many other stations but not CBS in Tucson. I spent hours on the phone with Paramount+ but one is not allowed to speaj to tech support. It goes on from their. It does not seem that Paramount+ is interested in fulfilling its obligations.",0
I have been with sprint / t mobile for 17 years never ever had a problem with sprint but tmobile I was late on my bill one time in 17 years and they want to charge 160 for a reconnect fee on top of my 190 bill I am beyond mad I might go to Verizon,0
Same thing bait and switch. Said credit for phone then never mentioned I would have to pay for the phone for two. My bad for not reading the fine print but the store made it sound like the phone was paid off and the contract was for two years.,0

"Absolute horror story beginning to end. Wrong trade in phone written on the order, had to return brand new phone and completely start over after hours in the store and three days waiting for the phone. Then SIM card they installed in the old phone wasn’t  activated, was told it was xfinity’s fault and wasted hours trying to get it resolved only to find out it was TMobile all along. Another week of no service. Then phone couldn’t be activated after 4.5 hours, was told it was their connection but it didn’t work at our home either. Finally got issue resolved after multiple days, one hour trips each way and several hours in the store, calls, texts, etc. Then received notification our checking account was debited, wanted to use a credit card from the beginning, wasn’t told it would be an additional $20 per month. Was told we received a credit for trade in phone against out of pocket costs, which never happened. Several calls to customer service later our service is more expensive than we were told, there’s an additional charge for a phone and the credit doesn’t offset it, and no one seems able to understand the simple math that $120 credit against $120 charges equals $0. What a mistake.",0
"T Mobile SUCKS. Worst thing I ever did switching. Dropped calls when in 5 bar service area, texts that never get delivered or people tell me they sent a text and I never get them. It's not random either, poor service all the time.",0
"About a year ago I decided to switch  from Verizon after 38 years to T Mobile since they were offering big deals to switch. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!!Their customer service is awful, their deals are not what they promise and they cannot fix their issues.After 6 days I went back to Verizon. This experience Cost me about $100 and a lot of headaches!!!!!Think twice before you change your service!!!!",0
The area I live in suppose to be compatible with T mobile. I live in Apex NC. T mobile is the worst phone carrier I ever had. Every month a tower is down and I’m unable to use my phone not to mention my dumb ass got there internet to so when my phone is down I can’t even use my internet. Then they tell me o we will credit ur account lies they tell. This happens to me at least three to four times a month. I’m am over there trash ass service. You’re not compatible in my area stop your lies t mobile. Once I pay my last phone off I’m switching my service.,0

"Switching tmobile has been nothing but a nightmare,I came from spectrum mobile on the Verizon network , never had any issues using data in my home ,  my data speed on the 4g lte network was around 140 megabit per second download but verizon has no 5g network I'm my area so I came to tmobile there 5g speed is abouy 50 megabits Now I have no data connection in my home I have towers everywhere around me there is no excuse. 1 week in to the plan data just disappears in and out constantly,   I got mixed reasons chat says tower upgrade then chat again says no tower upgrade and phone support says tower upgrade ,  don't they let customers know their services will be interrupted?Trade your device with T-MOBILE is far from trade ins.  When you take your car for a trade in the trade value gets deducted from the new car sale .. not as a credit..smh but here it's we buy your device and just give you credit on your account so you can buy more tmobile products with your creditIt's not a trade inNow I'm looking to go back to my old carrier",0
"In November 2021, I traded-in 3 phones (family plan) for a total trade-in value of $2400 ($800 each) at T-mobile. T-mobile promised to return the $2400 in the form of a one time credit and further credits spread over 30 months. However, I have had to call in dozens of time spending close to 50 hours on the phone with them to get the credits. Each time, I'm promised a refund only to see a small partial credit. Each time, I argue with the company to honor the contract, I'm assured a refund of the payments due.After I filed a on the phone  complaint with the FCC, t-mobile now tells me they will honor the trade in credit but start the 30 month cycle 13 months after the original contract date. They are not willing to give in writing Tbey abrogated the contract.Given this is affecting thousands of customers, it is possible T-mobile swindles customers of a couple of billion $ every year.If we get more than 40 customers willing to go to court, we could file a class action lawsuit against T-mobile?",0
"If this service had 0 stars I would give zero stars to T Mobile Sales and Billing. I am not sure that the promises made by Telesales are real. So far, there is a discrepancy between the Tele-sales offer and the billing. I agreed to transfer five lines from ATT. I have the pdf file with the chat with Tmobile sales. The deal was for $176 per month including taxes and fees after some 20% insider code promo—also, four ""free"" iPhones 14s with no trade-in. I signed a contract for the New four phones 14s for $129 per month but  I was told the promo for moving from att would give me an equal credit of $129 every month for 24 months. When I called the billing they told me my monthly will be $280 per month and only two phones are ""free"" the other two  I have to pay for. If I complete the Port  from ATT to T mobile I would pay $80 more per month and have to pay for the iPhone 14s. The customer service is hard to understand and there is a lot of background noise. Some call centers overseas. The last person helping finally told me verbally that indeed I was going to get what I was promised but it could not be put in writing. (leap of faith?) I am tempted to return the unopened four iPhone 14s to T mobile and keep ATT, I have only transferred one line with a phone I own.  I have not ported the other four lines because I suspect it will be a billing nightmare. I have spent close to 5 hours dealing with billing so they can not guarantee my bills to reflect what TElesales sold me on. Legally, they made me sign an installment purchase for the phones but all the promotions are verbal statements or in the chat.  No one seems to care about the chat transcripts. They also, indicate to pay the wrong bills and that they are corrected eventually. In other words once I am stuck with the phones they own me and they can bill whatever they want. How can this company be gaining so many new customers with the BAIT and Switched strategy? These people need to be accountable.",0

"I was told I was getting a free phone. Unfortunately, I was on automatic payment so I didn't see my bill. They not only charged me for the ""free"" phone, they charged me for insurance.

"I would prefer to give them zero stars.t-mobile ported my phone number without being able to activate my phone. They keep saying I need to come in to a store to activate so I keep reminding them I am out of the US. Now I have no access to my US phone number. I cannot even get out of t-mobile and back to my previous carrier because they cannot send me a text to confirm my number because I have no service. I have wasted literally hours on the phone and many dollars of international phone time trying to get them to fix this and they are incapable of even releasing my phone number to me. I've tried emailing or using their chat feature to avoid the expense of international calling, but I cannot login because my phone isn't working and they do not allow anyone to email or chat without first logging in. I am beyond angry with them. I responded to a request for feedback 3 weeks ago and checked their box requesting follow up contact from a manager, but have heard nothing. They are horrible.Follow-up: Back in the US, still can't cancel because now they say my account is suspended and I somehow owe them almost $200. I still have not had service from them, never received any bills, and have spend more hours on the phone with customer service people who cannot help.

"I've been with the company for 23 years.  I was going to switch carriers, but was offered a new phone to stay while maintaining my current bill, which according to the agent ""would have to be adjusted manually each month"",but promised that it would be taken care of.  Subsequently each month it has not been taken care of and I have to call and ask for an adjustment each month.  A supervisor even went back and reviewed the phone call of the original agreement and credited my account and apologized and informed me that it would be adjusted,  but yet after 5 months I'm still dealing with it.  Today, I was told that it could no longer be adjusted and I'm stuck with a higher bill an extra phone line that I don't want or need.....and if I cancel it, I have to pay the full price of my new phone.  Deceptive and frustrating.",0
"I've been a customer for 16 years. I recently switched companies. I canceled my service 3 days before the start of my billing cycle in July. In August, I noticed a charge to my bank account for a full month's service, which was canceled over a month prior. I was told that even though the number had been switched over for 3 days, the account was closed the day that the billing cycle started. How convenient! After spending over 1.5 hours talking to reps, telling me I need to go into a physical location (more inconvenience) for me, they acknowledged that if anything, I should have been billed at a pro-rated rate of just one day.  I disagreed and the supervisor rep finally told me they would credit my account the full payment amount, not even pro-rated. I called my bank and had them halt the payment of the charge because T-Mobile was able to take my money in a day but it would take up to 10 business days to return my money.Fast-forward to a few weeks later, and we get a bill in the mail for the full-amount, plus an additional $30 fee. We called T-Mobile again and had another supervisor waive the entire fee, which was supposed to have been waived a few weeks prior. This time we recorded the call at least.Fast-forward to last night and we got yet another bill in the mail from T-Mobile. Called and they said we had a $0 balance and all was resolved. We chalked it up to the previous call being made after that last bill was sent to us.Today we received a letter from a collections agency from T-Mobile. So in a month and a half of the bill being ""late"" (even though they admitted 2 times being in the wrong), they sent us to collections.I've had perfect credit my entire life, and T-Mobile is trying to do what they can to change that over their mistake. This is how they treated a long-time loyal customer. Disgusting company.",0

"Tried to switch services with T-Mobile, Service and signal from them on my phone was not good.. tried their service for 1 week They had one excuse after another not to give me a refund back of what they had charged me for, They somehow took a payment out of my account that prepay had been canceled from. They gave me a run around of probably two weeks different people then tried to charge me more than next month so they charged me $16.15 for a trial period of maybe 7 days Not a company company to deal with. all the way around they're not honest I spent 45 minutes on the phone with someone trying to straighten this out She acted like she knew what she was doing and was going to give me full credit back  Then by the time the conversation was ending her dollar amount changed!!

Im so disappointed I have excellent credit I switched 4 lines to T-Mobile from att. I wasnt to upgrade my 2 lines and they want me to pay high down payments on phones they lied to me over and over on at customer service that they would fix it but they didn’t after 4 calls still got the run around how they care I will leave reviews everywhere how they lied to me. I even asked about upgrades when I got the new service. They said Every customer is different that you get a spending limit. I have a 795 credit score and it’s just not right I will go back to att where I can get anything I want and just pay taxes. I would have never switched to save 30 bucks a month.,0
It sucks and I have plenty of towers around me. It's not consistent. I lose signal and get buffering all the time watching tv. Many times it interferes with downloading. I will move gateway around the house constantly. Customer service is a joke. Was promised a local team but many times outsourced far away. The last thing they pulled is no longer allowing credit cards for auto pay. They had a data breach just last year (UPDATE) and another one just this week. I refuse to hand over the keys to my bank account to appease this mega rich corporation who cares less about my money. I am done with them.,0
"If I could give 0 star or negative, I would.Customer Service sucks. Signal sucks. Overpriced service.I paid my phone in full but I could not get my phone unlocked. And it has been more than 7 days.

But nothing has resolved.Who gives Tmobile the right to hold my phone hostage for weeks while I have paid my phone in full?Boycott the company!",0

We were quoted a plan price (written down by sales salesperson).  We got a text saying sign up for automatic payments and you will get another $5 discount per line.  Come to find out, if we did not sign up for auto-payment it would cost more. No discount there. Bait and Switch.2. One line could not be activated the first day we purchased the other two phones.  Based on sales rep advice, we activated the line and they would roll the activated number to an actual new phone the following weekend.  We were charged for 2 activation fees.3.  The quoted price for the phones we traded in was inaccurate - to the tune of $400 less than quoted.4.  The customer service rep was very rude when we tried to understand what was going on and he basically said we should have known what the phone was worth and that when the phone was sent in, someone made the decision.  (We can understand if it was broken or water damaged of course the value should be reduced, but really if your employees do not know the value of a phone or mislead, or lie about the value, isn't that on the company??5.  Coverage across rural SD and MN is not good.  Dropped calls several times over the miles.6.  So after month 2 bill, the cost is much higher than expected.  Oh yes and be sure your tech skills are strong as you will have to navigate their website and the app.",0
Charged me for a closed account and then said they cannot access the information to credit the $115.,0
