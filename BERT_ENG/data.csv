"At my request, T-Mobile processed a suspension of my T-mobile home internet service and promised the monthly fee would be reduced from $50 to $10. As agreed, the service got suspended immediately but T-mobile continued to charge the full subscription amount of $50. When I called in again, the agent just said, sorry there was an update to our terms (= fineprint) and now when we suspend we continue to charge the full amount. Of course, this makes no sense whatsoever. Why even offer a suspension when you get charged no matter what. And not living up to the agreement is just fraudulent. Took me a lot of headaches and escalation to get the charge refunded and I just canceled my line. Goodbye T-Mobile. Never again! Current management seems to be on a mission to destroy all customer trust they once had.",0
Tried talking to customer service and am able to get anyone. Was talking to a Jay and he transferred me and no one ever came back on.  Very poor customer service I recommend do not sign up for the service as they do not stand behind anything once you sign up.  Impossible to speak with a human unless you go to a store hopefully you have 1 closer than 50 miles away.,0
"Representative MARTASHA from T-mobile lie to us so we could switch companies, she bribe us by telling us we will get new iPhones if we trade our phones, but that was a lie. We were considering switching to T-mobile, but every single representative we spoke to had lie to us and everyone said different information. We returned all the equipment they sent to us, and now they want to charge a restocking fee, even after having proof on writing what the representative offered was a lie just to get us to signed. They were so many hidden fees that doesn’t make sense, she said we will pay a certain amount a month, and ended up being wayyy more money that she told us. I should have listened to the reviews, this company has to be shut down!! What a nightmare they are.",0
Lies lies lies lies. Anything that comes out of their mouth is a lie and hidden fee you won't know about. Was due for an upgrade got a new phone and was told that it was paid off and time for upgrade so I did months later being hit with double charges for my monthly bill and come to find out they're charging me for both phones still that's crazy. Bill was 280 for no reason other then being misinformed,0
"Highly, highly highly recommend a HARD pass on Tmobile.  Their support is atrocious.  When it comes time to leave they make it brutal to reach them and do it and then they bill you for another couple of months and claim you didn't cancel.  Service is lousy. Go elsewhere - Dealt with Sam #4973207 and he truly had no ability to answer or resolve anything. Spent 2 hours the night before dealing with support person that was even less competent. There's a lot better and/or more affordable options.",0
"You can tell the people they hired are paid by the hour. The last several interactions I've had are outsourced so you can not even understand half of what is being said (and I'm in customer service and normally can) then simple what should be 5 minutes calls are put on hold for things the ""expert"" should know like 14 minutes to see how many gigs of data I used last month. Another 17 minutes on hold to tell me that I can upgrade my plan for one month for my vacation to get extra gigs. SERIOUSLY? 49 minutes for this convo- I'm traveling to mexico next week- wanted to make sure my plan covers international travel.  Her you only have 5gigs of data- me- can I buy more data?  That was the extent in entirety for 49 minutes! Not including the hour wait to talk to a tech. The people answering the phones there are just milking the clock. Or just not familiar in the slightest with where they work.",0
"They charged me for a year, 2 phone lines while I didn't have a single one! When I looked at the account, there's a random number I've never had! You'd think they'd apologize and refund me, but instead, they told me I should've checked my account! Pathetic! T-Mobile = Scammers",0
"They are a ridiculous and lying company! I made a cell phone plan and paid $127 every month for the plan, when the iPhone 16 was released they said that I could exchange the old device for the new one and I paid off the old device and got the new one and I would pay $127 dollars so I did I sent the device to them in the box that they sent me! I received 2 messages on the app saying that I had not yet sent the device and that my promotion would be canceled I called them and they informed me that it was already said that the device had already been received and that I did not need to worry 4 months would pass, I woke up my bill was $165 dollars. I went to the store to find out why, and the girl at the store told me it was because I hadn't sent the old device, so I had to cancel my contract. I had to pay $1,099 up front to keep my device, and I also lost my old device, which I had paid off because I sent it to them. People, don't sign a plan with T-Mobile, they don't honor the contract and in the end you'll lose. Look for another company. I looked and I'm satisfied with Verizon's service.",0
"Do not use these people! They of all cellular companies are the worst by far! The give you a billing date that means nothing to them if you have autopay. They claim autopay gives them the right to debit the payment 3-5 days before the due date . Why have a due date? Why not 3-5 days after the due date? They are desperate people . They will even charge you 10.00 to take the payment over the phone a day early! Their contract and word is worth nothing , just a company run by losers.",0
"This provider is a scam, cheat and a Lier.I have been with T-Mobile for several years with 3 lines, paying $105 a month which includes unlimited data.Last year they changed my plan without telling me and said it was a special offer, I ended up paying more and had to call them to revert to my original plan.I  have been in the UK for a while now, they blocked my unlimited data and roaming service, they said I was using too much data! I called them they were rude and would not restore my data and roaming service. I would give them a BIG 0 STAR if I could. I will be looking for another provider when I go back. What a big SCAM company.",0
"Representative at T'mobil made a bad mistake on 01/10/25 it was caught immediately. I called to speak to a manager,both were rude, and not helpful, I been a customer for 20 years thankfully no problems until now. The Rep was wrong, made an error, the managers admitted that but was still so rude and unprofessional.I am seeking another phone carrier.",0
"I would have to agree with the reviews that accuse T-mobile of being scammers. I found out My 83 year old MIL was being charged for T-Mobile $130/month for half a year for a phone she had cancelled. I tried multiple times to stop the withdrawals from her bank account but they refused to stop billing her because she “couldn’t remember her passcode.” The bank claimed they cannot cancel those monthly debits direct from account. They said we’d need to contact the debitor and disturbingly said that T-mobile wasn’t good about complying, I.e. they are scammers. T mobile eventually said she could cancel by going into the store. By the time I saw my MIL over holidays and took her to store to cancel, she was prob out $600 which they wouldn’t refund. What a bull$&@t company.",0
"Very very bad company! They sent me a device and when I returned it in same condition they charged me money for it saying that I damaged it! Despite the fact that it already arrived non working and damaged. And they use the fact that I cannot prove it because I took no pictures of it! Also they changed my plan without my knowledge and increased my monthly payment. Also one day I lost my internet driving in the middle of nowhere and lost my map. When I called them, they said that driver was disconnected?!!! What? So it was working before and someone disconnected it on purpose. When I asked for explanation, they couldn’t give one. But the last drop happened today. When I called the company and asked them to unlock my phone because I’m going to relatives funeral in Kiev, Ukraine, they said they would not do it because I’m on contract and it’s not up yet!! And on top of it they tried to sell me more international plans?!!! OMG. These people make money off of your pain!! STAY AWAY!",0
Negative 5 star review.   Was sold insurance and told at time of purchase of free phone replacement 4years later 20 amonth and a surprise 300 dollar for the free replacement phone.   Or I can upgrade from 300 for a worse model or 700.  Terrible scam,0
"TMobile is a scam company.  How do I know having never had an account with them?  They put a charge on my credit that I filed a fraud dispute over, but TMobile (And Transunion) refuse to examine the documents or give me the time of day.  I have 8 fraudulent bills in my file from TMobile, sent to MY house, meanwhile with the names of 7 other people on the bills.. My address.. another name.  I have sought to have Transunion consider these documents to no avail.  They are in cahoots one with the other.",0
Absolutely the worst customer service. I had a problem with my billing so I called the customer service and the woman said yes she can see there's a problem but you can't do anything with it right now. She tells me she will call me back today at 5:00 p.m. so I wait all day at home and she never calls. All they do is lie to you. They don't care if you have to pay more and all I did because I had the Netflix with ads and for $8.50 it said I could have it without the commercials so I go ahead and do it. Big mistake charges me almost $15 instead of the $8.50. So what do I do I just have to go to another phone company and get rid of T-Mobile because they don't care about that they outsource their customer service overseas where they just don't care there. They try to act nice but all you hear is noise in the background because they're all laughing having a good time. They promise you the world but when you have to make it change your account you have to go to an account specialist so you get passed on another 10-15 minutes and then they lie to you.,0
"Previously, I was prepaid only, as I didn't see the use of spending 60-90 for phone service. I needed internet, and options were limited in my area. They offered me $40 for my phone and $40 for internet. This was a lie. My bill is $120, not $80, with all of the additional fees. On top of this, I brought a perfectly unlocked phone to them, and they had the audacity to lock my phone and refuse to unlock it when I wanted to go elsewhere. Had I known they would do this, I would of never gone with them to begin with. I will be going right back to my prepaid service and use someone else for internet. These companies think they can do whatever they want to you. What right do you have to lock a phone that isn't your's? It was fully paid off. We as consumers need to stand up or continue to be controlled by these big corporations. We let them do anything to us..",0
"10,000 ZEROS! I have never, ever been more angry than I am right now. T-Mobile bills change without warning. They changed my services and added extras. I had to call them at least 10 times before I could find anyone that could or would even attempt to understand me.Hours spent talking to human robots that do not do anything to resolve problems by design. The lack of service is unecessarily abusive.They should greet you with: ""Welcome to T-Mobiles foreign-based customer torture chamber; how can we make your day more miserable? Do you enjoy repeating the same words over-and-over-and-over to barely English speaking people? Do you like being stuck in clown world vaccuum where nobody could hear you screaming? If so; T-Mobile is the place to be.That said; globalism reeks and so does T-Mobile.",0
"only put 1 star cause you have to!!  I went in to their store in Waterville to do a free up grade, granted it was time to pay my regular bill, so i expected to walk out 55$ less! We decide on the phone do all the work the whole time telling me nothing about fee's, last I knew FREE was FREE, suddenly he writes down $84 circles it and says this is what we'll pay today with tax n service, i said thats kind of high isnt it, oh wait is that including my $55 current owed, he jumped on it, and reassured me yes yes thats it! look at my bank account today and to my surprise 2 charges $55 and $84. Went back in to speak to someone they were no help jus basically told me it was fee's and taxes plus a walk in service charge, even though the phone rep told me I had to go do it at a store. So no resolve I'm no happy and will be shopping for a better place!! been dealing with them 2/3 years, no late, no complaint!!",0
"I ordered T-Mobile's home internet on October 17, 2024. Big mistake! No matter where I placed the gateway in our home, the gateway only showed one bar. What a joke! It wouldn't  provide a strong enough signal for even one of our smart TVs. Constant picture and sound lag. So I reinstated Spectrum internet. On Dec 26, I called and cancelled T-mobile. I was told the cancelation would not take effect until January 16, 2025. I argued that cancelation should take immediate effect, but to no avail. What a scam! This is their way of getting another full month of paid service despite the fact that I won't be using it from Dec 26th to when the cancelation takes effect on January 16th. This is no way for a company to earn consumer's trust and respect. Ipredict that T-Mobile's sketchy business practices will soon lead to its demise. A company just can't intentionally screw consumer's over and expect to remain in business.",0
T-Mobile Home Internet has been averaging 6-7 disconnects per day.  Calling or chatting with Support is always fun and interesting but they never have an answer other than resetting the equipment.Go with anyone else selling internet service except T-Mobile.,0
"I had Home Gateway that quit <9 mos old. Took it to T-Mobile store. It took 2 hours. They tried to give me new one as free exchange, however it would not work. So they pulled second one from back but told me it would ""cost me $11.04 because we already gave you one for free and we can't do it again"" I never had 1st new one in my hands or left store! Then they said, ""If you don't pay $11.04 then we can't give you Gateway. However, you can call T-mobile and order one for free that will come in 5 days."" I called Customer Svc in front of them and they told store ""you made a mistake and should not charge customer for second Gateway. There is a way to give it to him no-charge"" Store refused and charged me. Customer svc said they could not refund charge because of way store charged me. I called Manager who came to store. He said he would "" get refund to you in next 24 hours"". He never did. I disputed charge on my credit card. Therefore, T-Mobile added to my monthly bill, charged $15 late fee, and did not give me my autopay discount for the month. Therefore, my money bill is $40 higher this month than normal. T-Mobile is just as BAD, if not worse than Verizon, ATT, etc!!!",0
Hidden Fees for watch reactivations. And when you cancel they don't tell you they'll send you a final bill that doesn't come till a month later and they tack on more fees. I was forced to pay my bill late. Terrible service and hard to cancel.11558051198,0
"I have been a loyal customer with T-Mobile for over eight years always paid on time never had an issue with their billing. I tried to pay off a phone. The customer service representative told me the amount that I needed to close the account which never happened the phone remained locked, which I had already paid for And they charged me for two more months of service which they could see that I hadn’t used one minute of that service I called three separate times to be lied to to say it was taken care of and then I get a collection letter. I have a credit rating That is more important to me than paying them off.. And there’s no way I’m gonna let a hack job like T-Mobile screw it up so I paid them off again, but believe me I’m leaving bad reviews on every site that I see.It’s not worth your time your money and your sanity to join this cell phone company. Their service sucks and I’m talking about cell service too.",0
This is the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.  They sold me internet that never worked and never told me any time during a full month of tech calls and hours of my time that what they sold me would never work.  No internet for a month and gipted me out of a $200 rebate.  I warn anyone considering using T-Mobile internet to steer away.,0
"Tried to cancel internet before they sent me the modem. Told me I had to wait 24 hours but it would be cancelled and ""rest assured It would be cancelled and I wouldn't be charged"". Ended up on hold for 30mins the next day trying to make sure it's cancelled before I gave up. They sent it anyway. Now I need to figure out how to return this thing without being charged. It's ridiculous.",0
Just awful shop staff are incompetent changed my plan without telling me . Customer service the worst I have ever experienced took 9 days and close to 10hrs to restore my plan  plus charged me more than double the original plan cost !Phone service was great store  staff the worst and customer service the worst,0
"Review of T-Mobile Home Internet 15-Day Test DriveService Start: I began the 15-day trial with T-Mobile Home Internet in November. Initially, the service was poor, but after some adjustments, it significantly improved. I was impressed with the speed and quality of the service, to the point where I considered switching my lines from Xfinity to T-Mobile. However, due to the complexity of the process, I decided to cancel.Cancellation Process: I spoke with customer service, and they recommended canceling within the 15-day period, which I did. I received a return label for the equipment and sent it back before the deadline.Subsequent Issues: On November 29, I received a letter from the collections department for $55 with no explanation. I never received a bill from T-Mobile for this amount. Then, on December 9, 2024, I received another letter from a collection agency in PA for the same $55. Finally, on December 14, I received a bill for $32.66 for internet usage, despite having returned the equipment on time.Reflection: I am referring this case to the consumer protection department in the state of Oregon for review. It is concerning that a large company like T-Mobile uses tactics like these without following proper procedures. I hope that with advances in artificial intelligence, new companies with better services and more transparent practices will emerge, eliminating the need to deal with situations like this.",0
"We have had nothing but problems- dropping connectivity- had extra mesh installed, can't use or upload photos for work. The customer support is foreign and appears to read from a script/ is not a help. Multiple calls to customer support where they have an attitude. They ask the same questions over and over without logging the information or history. Cannot play video games etc- we lose internet continuously. After about a month , a different customer support said they would have continuous connectivity with our tower ( shouldn't it be already?) They say the same thing about the towers...And still the same issues again and again. Every time we call they ask the same questions wasting 20 or 30 minutes at a time like, our address, phone numbers etc...we have gotten hung up on or dropped from calls just to do it again. Once we have the opportunity we are changing our service to another company.After our call just today 3 January 2025 the lady finally admitted we were too far from our tower- so everyone else before knew that and kept taking our money. We only got one 1/2 of a month refund after complaining our faces off and now we finally know what the real issue is after 3 months! Apparently we are supposed to ""call back if we have continuous problems from here further"" Ridiculous and dishonest for them to obviously k own we wouldn't have connectivity where we are yet they allowed us to sign up. Total waste of time.",0
Got scammed. Internet did not work. Customer service is extremely lame. Store employees do not have authority,0
Thank you so much to all of you who took the time to share your negative experiences with us I appreciate it.  Because of the reviews and not one response from TMobile I have decided to go with another carrier.  So many reasons why I couldn't trust them ever I would say.  Happy Holidays.  Best.,0
"T mobile service is 💯 Horrible in my location ,, they promised last 4 years no worry we will have your service back working ,, unstable connection means never completely connecting to internet thus sucking data non stop.... they changed my contract from 100 gb to 50 but tells me it was always 50gb....what a big lie...",0
"I would give ""0"" if I could.  I am not complaining about the service across the country, although much improvement is necessary even on Interstates Freeways.  Instead, I am complaining about false advertisements for deals and rates.  As a senior citizen I chose to go with T-Mobile for its over 55 rates and I also chose to upgrade our phones because we were long overdue for new phones.  We went through Costco because not only were they giving $400 dollars per trade-in for each of our phones, but a Costco gift card on top of that (which they did). One year and seven months later, we are still paying for the phones, and it turns out to be FULL PRICE without the $400 trade-in. Their Customer Service is useless because I called about the bill within the first six months, and they said that our bills would reflect the $800 for the two trade-ins in due time.  Well, the bills continue at full rate. How dare they take advantage of seniors.",0
I have been LOYAL customer for close to 20 that is twenty years and lately they have chosen me my account to be slowest internet speed 4.12 down load speed and upload of 1.32 that is a disgrace for your service of $55 dollars a month,0
"I was with Tmobile for over 10 years, but it really went downhill. Poor customer service and price kept hiking every year. No quality service or benefits (upgrades, discounts, promotions) staying with them. I tried to keep my number, but they wouldn't let me when I switched carriers. All customer support people I talked too were from India or Philippines and they weren't that helpful.",0
I have been a customer of T-Mobile‘s for nine years. I went into the store today after being told I had a $3000 credit limit to upgrade my iPhone 12 to iPhone 16 Pro Max and was told essentially because although I make my payment on time every month I split the payments up into two payments. I’m being judged and now they want me to pay a total of $900 for two phones so I will be leaving T-Mobile.,0
"so here it is tmobile is over charging customers, here it is I have paid 1780 in fees and for services for the last 3 months to owe tmobile 1726 for services and fees to now being threaten to turn off my services for 200 dollars on a over payment they got in November and made adjustment on my billed to still charge it and get a message stating I have a past due for December 16 of 212 dollars to pay 300 on that 212.00 to owe them now 600 dollars! That’s a rip off! The supervisor said it well the 212 was past due but it was incorrect! How? How can a company say you owe them 212 in past due fees on the 16 of December to get a payment of 300 on the 23rd of December to now owe you 600 on the 25  and they turning my services off! Sad Tmobile, so the supervisor stated to now having to pay us more to get your phone back on to over charge again! this is not right!!",0
horrible company. piss poor coverage and rude personnel. when i paid them a year in advance they accused me of fraud. they are now dragging out mf refund. horrible company,0
Over the last year or so T mobile service in Denver has become near non existent. I can barely make calls and if I am able to make one they drop almost immediately. My texts don’t go through and I never have internet unless I’m connected to WiFi. It doesn’t matter where I am in Denver or Colorado. I’ve been unable to contact family during emergencies and unable to carry out payments with my phone when there isn’t WiFi. I can’t imagine worse coverage. I just paid off my phone so that I could unlock it and switch. I cannot recommend enough that you do not switch to T mobile under any circumstances.,0
"Very likely the worst customer service amongst telecom companies. Lost my phone while traveling in Europe, and tried to get a new SIM card to install in a temporary phone one of my family members gave me. Spent €180 in phone calls with them, in which I was told that the first SIM i was sent was not the correct one because it had a protection feature that could not be removed; and after the supposedly “correct” second SIM was received, ran into exactly the same problem. The reps on the phone don’t seem to know anything that has to do with international travel situations, and they refuse to let you talk to supervisors and managers. It’s a total disaster…",0
"In December, I upgraded my phone but decided to return it under their policy and purchased a different one. My trade-in had already been processed, but after extensive conversations in-store and online, I was assured by multiple T-Mobile representatives that the bill credits from the first purchase would transfer to the second.Fast forward a year, and I’ve discovered that wasn’t true. I didn’t notice the missing credits sooner because my bill is already higher than other providers. When I reached out, T-Mobile apologized (Chat Reference ID: 2cd9bf0e-5733-44bc-aae8-ceeffd5fa014) and offered to start issuing the credits now—spread over the next two years until December 2026. But this doesn’t address the almost $500 already stolen from me because multiple people lied to me about transferring the trade in device credits.Under the original agreement, my phone would have been paid off by December 2025, and my bill would have been $40–50 cheaper per month. Instead, I’m stuck paying for their mistake.T-Mobile, I want a refund for the money you owe me, not just future credits. This is unacceptable.",0
"Worst phone carrier ever, do not waste your time. I switched from Verizon for 8 days, had the most horrible phone service I’ve ever experienced, called in to switch back and was told my four lines were closed out and no balance on the account. A month later I receive a phone call from T-Mobile saying I owe $246, as I’ve called in and spoke to someone and their manager they refuse to make it right and because it wasn’t closed out properly (somehow that’s my fault) they are leaving a balance on the account until I pay it. I will never be using T-Mobile for the rest of my life and I don’t recommend it for anyone.",0
611 customer care has a glitch in it where it wont complete transaction. Then it will put you on hold for an hour!!!,0
"I bought an iPhone for the first time. It was carrier locked through T-Mobile so I called the customer service and the snarky lady on the other end kept asking for an account number though I explained twice that I didn’t have service with them and didn’t understand why they could not use the iMei like every other company I had gone through to look into the issue. The woman was rude and didn’t provide any other info as to what I could do.Needless to say I have a phone I can’t use and I wouldn’t use T-Mobile if they were the last company on earth, I’d write letters and mail them first. Thanks for nothing T-Mobile.",0
"I was quoted a price of $150/month for a new cellphone plan (including two new phones) in-store (3315 Westpark Dr, Houston, TX 77005) and the price I’m actually paying is $90/month higher than what they quoted me. I’ve called customer service and the store multiple times and no one has solved my issue. This is outrageous. It was deceptive. It was a total bait-n-switch. They need to be held accountable for what they promise.",0
"It's unbelievable how difficult it is to get it is to get anything done with their customer service. I signed up for 2 business internet lines, 2 business phone lines with trade-ins. I have spent collectively 7 hours on the phone with sales and various customer service departments just trying to get the lines set up, phones traded in, and business internet set up.",0
"Just found out that they changed their policy, when the account is suspended they still charge the full amount.  Last year it was a not so reasonable $10/month, now it is just a ripoff!   Will return the gateway modem from now on, and need it will go pick up a new one....",0
"The people at my local store, refused to help me carry two small boxes inside, from my car. I told them I was physically disabled and all three said no. I had to struggle getting the boxes in.

"Won't go into big story, this company is a money making scamming franchise. I know of a few law suits on them now. The bad thing is the fcc, the US government and others choose to ignore and let them do what they do. This is why we have bad things going on in this world today. Yes some folks are allowed free reign ,however Don't let a no one like me try to some illegal crap, I'll sit in jail until I rot. TMobile is a bunch of crooks and scammers. But their day is coming!!!!😁",0
Terrible customer service I upgraded router to the new one and sent the old one back with ups  now they saying that the was damage because the little paper sticker in the back is scratched and they charged me  79.00 dollars for it . Impossible to resolve issue. Supervisors are useless  and uncaring . I'm ready to drop the whole service . Feels like scam,0
"In July, I signed up for internet service but then learned their speed was inadequate for my needs. I cancelled within 48 hours but was told that the contract gave them 60 days to make the cancellation effective during which time they would bill my card. Customer service assured me that after those 2 months all payments would be refunded to my card. It is now December- 5 months later - and no refund. I called and was told that they will now process the refund. I asked why it had taken so long and was told that they don’t ever make the refund until the customer calls and asks for it. These people are snakes. I will never do business with them again.",0
"F-n HATE this company. I had Sprint since Sprint was Nextel. Then T-Mobile bought Sprint and promised that Sprint customers would go to TMobile towers - LIE #1. They used the same old nonworking Sprint towers. I couldn't even get cell service inside or outside my own condo. And that's a problem as a First Responder in FL, esp during the pandemic and hurricane season when I'm on call. Thankfully I had a separate work phone (Verizon) that worked. As for my responder discount, I've been trying since Nov 2024 (it is now Dec 2024) to verify it using the whackass busted app called T-Life and I'm even on the phone trying to get a person for an hour. Also, upgrades were supposed to come with Costco bucks, but I ain't seen mine yet. Two tin cups with a string would work better than this. Everything about this company is broke, busted and utter crap. GO ELSEWHERE.",0
"I chose T-mobile after being treated like garbage by AT&T.  I chose T-mobile primary because they U.S. based support.

I've had to listen to it > 2 than a minute of canned frustrating announcements before it would put me into a queue for a human representative.  If you're lucky enough to get an American representative, they're still great; it's the greedy executive decisions to put up roadblocks to you talking to anyone.",0

Your company sucks with lazy minds, and I will tell the world why I feel this way!",0
"I wish I could give 0 , MISS information just to make more money , when they do get the money the response is “ we can’t do anything about it” bought a new phone “on them” and now they want me to pay it off in order to use it internationally when they told me I won’t have to ! Fkn Ridiculous",0
"The WORST service that I’m absolutely dumbfounded. Called to get a receipt for a temporary eSIM. A receipt. 1 hour goes by and they still can’t resolve the issue, I ask to speak to the supervisor who turns out to be the absolute worst person for the job imaginable. The person’s name was AJ. After explaining my situation to him and that I’ve been on the call with them for an hour, AJ had zero apologies but instead began to argue with me over their incompetence 😂 said that their security is just SO good that they can’t access my account by any means. When I said that this experience was disappointing, he has the nerve to argue and say “no it is not” after which I hung up. So AJ if you’re reading this, hope you get fired and work someplace FAR from customers.",0
"Closing this account has been a nightmare.  I have been to the store three times to request that the account be closed, with each time getting a verbal confirmation, yet each month they continue to bill my account.  I have spent countless hours on the phone as well.  I finally had to close our bank account to prevent further charges.  After over $1000 of fraudulent charges, T-Mobile still refuses to provide documentation that the account has been closed, or to refund the charges.  I'm now exploring what to do in response to this fraudulent interaction.",0
I called to get my balance. The representative barely spoke English. He said he couldn't verify me and will not give me any information on my account. I've had the same number for 20 years. I DID understand the part where when I asked he said he was in the Philippines.Shame on you T-Mobile that yououtsource for the sacrifice of quality customer service. I'm looking into another carrier tomorrow!,0
"I would give 0 Star if I could.  We purchased a Home Internet system - Home Internet Plus.  When we were done, they gave us 3 trackers for ""FREE"".  Two days later (including Thanksgiving"", we went to the store to return the trackers as we didn't think we would use them.  We were told that we had to pay $20/each restock fee to return them.  Nobody even asked us if we wanted them when we purchased the system.  They just put in the bag with the  internet package, without explaining any extra possible charges, such as if we lost one and others..  We feel that it was a scam designed by the company or the sales representatives working there were not honest.",0
Would give them a zero!!   Tried to return because internet didn’t work in my house.  Argued for 1 hour with customer service over 1.83.  Was so tempted to just pay it.  The support representative kept telling me it was a legitimate charge but I canceled in the allotted amount of time.   Finally asked for a manager  and they were able to take the charge off.  This is a very bad way to treat customers!!,0
Companies a THIEF helping themselves with other people's bank accounts after REFUSING to issue a confirmation number.. after I've been a customer for 15 years..spend your money elsewhere.. would NEVER recommend..,0
"T-Mobile cheats me when I went to the store on Black Friday at 8:00AM. The saleman told me about T-Mobile Internet and asked me to try out for two weeks free.  I agreed and took the brand new modem home.  By 6:45PM, I returned to the store and returned the new modem back without opening the box.  I told him I'm not interested.  So, I did a paper work and printed me a receipt.Now T-mobile charged me $218.20 including $160 monthly phone service. Don't ever try out with their offer.T-Mobile advertised I can get discount for my old Iphone trade-in for $150. After all transactions, I received an email I only got $45 and I need to get another $90 from Apple.  I canceled my order.Don't buy Iphone from T-Mobile or Phone Service provider. Buy directly from Apple store.  The store does not have what you need and they need to order anyway.",0
"STAY AWAY. A SCAM. In the USA:  I switched to them, found out within two days that I couldn't get coverage at my home or office so closed account.  For SIX months, I've been trying to get a refund for the money I paid since the coverage didn't work. NONE.  Been working on this, they never call you back.  Today, just found out despite escalation there is a clause that says even if you don't use the service you owe that amount.  I switched because I have several friends that have used them for decades all over the world without any problems. DON'T BE TEMPTED.  STAY AWAY.  THEY WILL NEVER HELP YOU.",0
Tmobile sucks and it keeps disconnecting don’t use tmobile if you want to have good connection,0
"I paid off my phone and I switched my service to a new company. I asked T Moblie to unlock my phone multiple times but it is locked for the second week. First time I called I spent 40 minutes on the phone with the T Mobile they told me that the phone is not purchased via T-Mobile so they would not unlock it. I explained that T-Mobile sold me the phone and I used to pay monthly to T Mobile for this phone. She replied that since the phone is not from T-Moble she cannot help me to unlock it. I had to explain again that I have all the paperwork in front of me showing that it was purchased from T-Mobile and in each bill it is stated that I paid for the phone with a final balance to be paid. She asked me to do some resetting and try to unlock it but with no result. Finally  I was informed that I would get an email, and the matter would be taken care of by the technical department and the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. I did not get any email and after 4 days the phone was not unlocked.Next time I called I spent 80 minutes on the line with T Mobile going through settings on my phone and mostly waiting on line. The lady told me that the phone was not used so it cannot be unlocked. I explained that I have been using the phone for a year. She replied: “since the phone was not used the phone cannot be unlocked”  I had to repeat that I just said that I was using the phone for a year. And so on, and so on. Finally she said that the phone will be unlocked for sure this time in 24 hours. But nothing happened. We talked 2 days later and went thru the settings and I was told that the phone will be unlocked in 24 hours. It wasn't. I called 2 days later and I spent 2 hours on the phone with one lady and next another gentleman. Finally he asked me to go to the T-Mobile store. I explained that I already did go to the store but they said they don’t handle unlocking the phones and I have to call T-Mobile. But he explained that I need to go to another location so I did go to find the same reply, “we don’t handle the unlocking of phones, please call T-Mobile.",0
"T Mobile updated their Voice Mail application, and it is no longer accessible.  Called the help desk, and they didn’t know what to do either.  The T Mobile new voice mail application used to work fine, however the new application is broken, and their folks do not know how to fix it yet.",0
Left T-Mobile because they did the bait and switch regarding free Netflix. Now I have a credit balance for $(6.79) and they say they can't access my account without a pin to issue me a refund check. Instead I keep getting monthly statements saying my credit will be applied to next months bill. Worst customer service and a reminder why I left them.,0
"Stopped in a T Mobile store last week to inquire about current promotions that they had. I walked out with a deal that I couldn't say no to and they put it in writing. However a few hours later after talking with T Mobile Customer Service I found out that they performed a Bait and Switch tactic and was signed up for a plan all totally different and much more expensive then was agreed to and put in writing. They told me I was welcome to return the equipment back to the store. When I attempted to return it the next day, T Mobile told me that it is their policy to charge a restocking fee which was huge, over $100.00. I refused told them that I was going to keep their equipment until I receive a call from a higher up supervisor in the company but as of the date so far I never received a phone call after repeated attempts and I am still holding on to their equipment. Needless to say I will never do business with T Mobile ever again",0
"After 20 plus years with this company they did nothing to make things easier. After my rate kept increasing there were no deals to keep my bill at a decent rate for just one line. I switched over to Xfinity and tried to use my Google pixel (that had been paid off completely) and keep my number. I have been waiting over a week to get them to unlock my phone so I can use it with Xfinity. Ever time I call it's the same thing, ""they're waiting for business solutions"". I have been told it takes 10 minutes at the most to unlock a phone. And I have been waiting this long. T-Mobile does not care about their customers. They do nothing to help you out. I really don't agree that they would be voted best customer service.",0
No stars if allowable. They are liars and scammers. When communication with them on social media they’ll block you for leaving a negative review. They are the worst company. Charge you for bills after your number has been ported to another carrier. Reported this on my credit and refused to remove it after they agree it’s their error. I’ve already experienced adverse effects from this from long standing creditors.,0
This company's phone service is terrible. There customer service is shit. They lie to get you in. I canceled my service in August and I am here with another bill in November on hold. These people should be shut down. They are a bunch of theives,0
"I got my first cell phone in 1994, just when cell phones were becoming popular. My service then was through AT&T Wireless.  As you can imagine at that time cell towers were few and far between. My cell service then was 10 times better than it is today with T mobile.  T mobiles’ service is absolutely terrible everywhere I go!!   I’ll be loving as soon as possible and will NEVER return!",0
"Are the customer reps at T-Mobile in a competition to see who can be the rudest and least helpful overall to their clients? That is the only explanation I can fathom for the continued experience I've had with the company over these past three years. On the technical side, I do receive basically reliable phone service and I can live with the bill. While all my devices are eligible for upgrade, and I want to upgrade all of our devices; T-Mobile doesn't want to reach across the aisle with any enticing offers. They are beyond greedy and show no respect for long time loyal customers.",0
"Unbelievable, I had to return a cell phone to T-Mobile and an IPad that was under warranty. The phone is fine but they sent me a different color ipad that was damaged with dents ans scratches. The representative assured me she would call me back to see if I should keep my iPad and return theirs or vice versa, she called me and said hold the iPads I am waiting for an answer but never called back now despite giving them the tracking numbers for both devices being returned they are billing me $1600 !!! Time to leave Tmobile no one can clarify the bill, a new rep is in contact with me who said she will have the old rep call me now the old rep calls back and says they can't take there own damaged replacement back!!!!",0
"If I could give a zero that'd be more appropriate for this review.  I'm on a family plan and was interested in staying with TMobile but wanted off the plan, stay with TMobile and get a new number.  I researched their plans and decided to go with the 55 plus plan as I will be 66 this Friday.  The person at the store was not very interested in helping me or offering any feedback.  Frustrated I  said, ""ok I'll go with AT&T"".  Want to know what he said, ""ok, good luck""  The entire time I was with him he seemed more interested in what he was doing on the computer than helping me so I left.  Went to another carrier and notified my friend who said that's disappointing the lack of interest I was given and she will process this and may follow me to the other carrier.  She's been with TMobile for years but was very disappointed in the lack of professional customer Service and may leave herself.  That's all.",0
"Last year, I was influenced by a T-Mobile ad. I went to their website and it says my rural area in middle Ga, 30 miles outside Macon Ga, was a strong signal area. I ordered their SIM card, and it gave me zero bars. Thankfully, I was refunded. I now have 1 bar (always) with an ATT SIM card.",0
They are definitely liars. Promise you one thing and do something different. It's impossible to talk to an English person let alone a manager. You can't reason with these foreigners. Best you can do is file a complaint with the FCC and Better business.,0
"I’ve been experiencing nonstop issues with T-Mobile. I no longer have service with them, yet they continue to withdraw money from my account every month. When I request them to remove my credit card information from the account, they claim that I no longer have an account, so they cannot access it to remove the information. As a result, they just keep taking money from my account. This situation is absurd and unreasonable, and when I do manage to speak with a customer service representative, the issues persist.",0
Terrible customer service. Utterly incompetent team who messed up my sim and I had to go a week without a phone service because they cancelled my sim and refused to reactivate it so that I can port out. They also took 60 dollars without my permission and without checking compatibility with my phone. It took them 2 seconds to take the money and then cancel my sim. but 5 days before anyone started on working on my issue. they also lied to me and 2 hrs per day on call with they horrible care reps,0
I was a customer for 3yrs with Crooked T-Mobile. Giving up my account for their convenience did me no good. Still”they took their payment April 4th. By the 5th my service was terminated. It was hell from that date on. The whole month they’re sending Tickets to locate the payment. By the end of the month I was drained. Moving on to another carrier was my only option. But”not with slimy T-mobile one can’t move on. They blocked my iPhone as if I owed them money I had prepaid pay as I go. And”it is now 12/23/24 those Crooks never reimburse me my $67.08. I’m on fixed income I’m not rich”I went out a bought Tshirts that reads. I was Robbed by T-Mobile. Join the movement these big companies are to powerful with our money.,0
"T-Mobile was hacked around 2023 and since thenmy phone is flooded with daily text messages askingfor donations to Trump campaign, my opinions aboutRepublican candidates, surveys and messages fromcandidates. Reporting text as junk and delete doesn’t help because random numbers continue.Only eats up my iOS memory.",0
"The instore sales people are wholly incompetent and then fall back on the signed paperwork as what is confirmed.Even if the money to tmobile is exactly the same, they won't rectify anything on their end and will fall back on the contract terms.Woefully incompetent through and through sales/customer service reps and frankly should be a class action lawsuit somewhere.",0
"Worst customer service EVER !!!!  Go to any other phone provider, run go !!!",0
"Their customer service is awful. I cancel their overpriced cell service to get a better deal with a different provider. They still took money from my account. I called and explained to them that I cancelled the service, but they insisted they were right. They were not right. They keep sending me notices that I have a credit that will be applied to my next bill. How can that be when I don't have an account. I have called multiple times to get a refund and I'm given the run around and never get the money I am owed. Today I had to jump through more hoops to finally get the promise of a prepaid card mailed to me. The money NEVER should have left my bank account! I am glad to not be a customer with this company that thinks it is okay to steal from a person's bank account and then have the audacity to make them prove that the money was wrongfully taken out of their account. If you had the correct system of accounts, you would be able to see on a closed account that the customer is owed a refund. Start taking accountability and show your customers some respect. This ordeal has been many months in the making. Glad it is over. I do not recommend this company at all!",0
"Terrible company owes me $1100, was rude; just terrible. Now dragging me along. Stay wat",0
published review 12/5/24I had T-Mobile for over 10 years and I decided to switch last April because the coverage was getting bad. After I switched I called T-Mobile customer service to unlock the phones and cancel my service. Yesterday my wife noticed they have been charging us for months and when I called to get a refund they said that I never cancelled. They have the record of me calling to unlock my phones and cancel those but they kept 1 line and charged me over $165 a month and will not refund my money. They stated that I never requested to cancel a line that I never had. When you sign up the sleazy salesman sign you up for extra lines for there promotions and do not tell you about it. My line had 9 lines and I only have 3 phones and a iPad. Run from this crappy company.,0
Don't buy any accessories through t-mobile!  I have been with them for years but the return window is so short and you can't return anything without doing a live chat.  I spent days using the app and the online system and finally decided to chat with an agent.  It took several tries to get through the automated agent and then I received no help from the live agent.,0
"They are only nice as long as your a customer, but as soon as you switch then thier attuide changes when you talk to um on the phone. They over charge you on your bill and use a phrase called a one time charge to make money after you canceled your service to charge you  7 dollars over and over again",0
NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE A CUSTOMER OF TMOBILEHorrible experience. I have been a customer of TMobile for over 7 years with 4 open accounts and paid my bills on time. I have always had insurance to protect my phones and account. My phone broke on 12/24/24 and I went to the store. They said they could not do anything and go to the insurance. We called the insurance and they sent a new phone. I was on a call to transfer the information from the old phone to the new one for more than 3 hours and TMobile could not do it. They blamed the new phone and ordered a new one to be shipped to the store. They said it would take them about 15 minutes to transfer the information. I was just at the store and TMoblie put the wrong information on the phones and I could not get it transferred. I spent another 3 hours on the phone trying to figure out at the store and the only thing can do is order me another phone that will take another 4 days to arrive. I will be without a phone for more than a week and all TMobile wants to do is to give me a free cheap phone or to upgrade and pay more for a new phone.  The supervisor on the phone did nothing but blame the store or the first customer service representative and did not provide a solution. After 7 years I will bring my business elsewhere since TMobile does not care. It is all about the money to them!,0
If I could leave a zero rating I would.  I was with them for nearly 25 years with always paying them on time.  However switching from their company to another is hell with misinformation and multiple late fees as a result.  I advise if you are starting with a new cell phone carrier to choose any other company.,0
"Switched to a much cheaper service with far superior coverage but can't stop payment at t-mobile because I can't remember the PIN I set over 2 years ago.  So just hop on the t-mobile app and reset my PIN as per their call center IVR ‐ sounds easy right?  Nope, since I'm no longer a customer, I cannot reset my PIN!  Go to the store to find out there are things on my account that don't apply to us like home internet and an iPad, we never had either.  Have we been paying for those things?  Your guess is as good as mine and theirs, they really don't know.  Without a PIN, absolutely no one can help me.  We just paid what we paid and we're still paying and there's quite literally nothing that can be done about it.  No one in the local store and no one in customer service can help me despite all of them being able to tell we canceled the service so I have to pay $40 to stop pay at the bank level.  If you're in the market, find any other company on the planet but this one.",0
"Would give 0 stars if it were an option, Tmobile has overpriced plans. I would recommend basically any other cell service company if you care about what is in your bank account. If you do have Tmobile currently, better watch the amount closely because it can and will change on you with no notice beyond just being present on your billing statement. If you're canceling your bill, you better ask if there are any additional charges because if there is, they will not inform you beyond a letter in the mail like we in the 1960s and they don't have your email address.",0
Run.......The worst customer service.  Two days trying to return a defective tablet.  Nothing but the run around and talked to some many people and a different story with each one!!!  i would NEVER EVER recommed them for tablets.,0
"STAY AWAY!!! After more than 20 years with Sprint/T-mobile, I recently switched phone service to Spectrum about a week before the end of the billing cycle. I was immediately locked out of my online T-mobile account, yet they managed to draft another full month’s payment. I called to request the final bill which took almost another month to receive. I was billed extra for closing my account mid-cycle. So instead of getting a refund, they said I still owed yet a partial payment. I still couldn’t log in to pay the balance, request a refund or anything at all because I no longer have an account. Then once again they managed to draft my bank account for the amount they say I owe. What a terrible company!  So glad I switched to Spectrum. My phone service is so much more reliable and I am paying less than half what T-mobile was charging monthly. I will never go back to them after this.",0
Deceptive.  Offer rebates and promotions that they do not honor.  There’s a class action lawsuit dated 12/8/24 for this.  I hope I can join.  There’s a reason they have 1.5 stars across the board.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with T-Mobile’s customer service and policies. My wife and I purchased a brand new iPhone 14, and after two days, we decided to return it unopened in exchange for an IPhone 15. To our shock, we were hit with a ridiculous $70 restocking fee. The store clerk had clearly told us that we had until Monday (three days after the purchase) to return the phone, especially since we were still deciding between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15.Despite this, T-Mobile refused to waive the fee. We’ve been loyal customers for years, but this experience has made us question our commitment to the company. It’s incredibly frustrating to be treated this way, especially when we followed the store’s instructions. I will seriously reconsider my options moving forward. We’ve since disputed the charge with our bank because a restocking fee is a complete gimmick designed to make more money for a multimillion-dollar company. It makes no sense to charge a restocking fee for a phone that was never opened and was returned just two days later.T-Mobile, please do better—your long-time customers deserve more respect and transparency.",0
"**""T-Mobile SCAM - Broken Promises on Promotions!""**I recently switched to T-Mobile after they called and offered me an incredible deal: $45 per line for four lines, plus four brand-new iPhone 16s if I traded in our existing phones (all newer than iPhone 12 Pro models). This promotion was the only reason I switched over.However, after I joined, T-Mobile conveniently ""couldn't honor"" the promised deal. They claimed the best they could do was $500 off each phone, despite having all the recordings of our conversation. I feel completely scammed by T-Mobile’s bait-and-switch tactics. Be wary of any promotions they promise on the phone—what you hear may not be what you get!",0
"Multiple salespeople tell you that the first two weeks are a free trial period and that you won't be charged anything if you cancel within this period. That proved untrue.Since the access speed was extremely slow, I had to cancel it within a week of activation, and the rep confirmed that I wouldn't be charged anything. I immediately sent back the device. However, after two weeks of cancellation, I received bills asking me to pay a monthly fee plus one-time charge. T-Mobile is now on my blacklist.",0
"Promised excellent coverage in the neighborhood by my house and it turned out to be dropped calls all the time.  I spent a crazy amount of time with customer service and they have done nothing except try to get me to convince the church in my neighborhood to put a t mobile tower on their roof.  Really mobile, it that my job our yours?!",0
I have been a TMobile customer for over 2 years. The prices keep going up service is not great. I have dropped calls no service in areas. Then I get hit with a free upgrade. Guess what it was not free I paid the fees then get my bill to discover I was billed $399 for the upgraded phone. I'm very  unhappy with the service. The customer service isn't much better. My prices continue to climb but I'm not getting anything else for my service. I do not recommend TMobile.  Go somewhere else.,0
T-Mobile is the absolute worst!!! I just got a bill and a debt collector statement on the same day when I canceled my service on October 20. The bill was for October 10-Nov 09. Again I canceled on Oct 20. Oh and it had a $15.50 late charge even though I never got a final statement. Keshayla rep# 1010734 explained to me that even though I only had service for 10 days I had to pay for the entire month and didn't even offer to take off the late charge because she claimed I was texted the final bill which is bull because I never received said text and they don't prorate. Paying for 2/3 of a month that I did not have any service is a ridiculous so they can forget getting my money,0
"Horrible idea for businesses. They will upsell you on promotional lines to reduce your monthly bill but then not close the lines out and continue to charge you for them when you move carriers because their reception is terrible. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
"I'm 70 years old and never have I had a company promise (voice and written) to refund money for a mistake they made, and then take it back!  When I first approached this with T-mobile, they wanted to add the overcharged amount to my account.  However, I wanted them to credit the amount to my credit card instead. After one month discussing this with four different representatives (and hours wasting my time waiting on the phone), I spoke to a manager.  She apologized for the inconvenience and trouble I had experienced with this issue.  She said she would not only refund the money to my credit card but would add another $16 and, in addition, I would not have to pay the next month's bill for $16. She also said she would send a confirmation email, and follow-up with me in one week with a phone call. Sounds good, right?  Well, she did email me the refund confirmation and they did cancel the next month's bill.  However, she never followed up with the phone call, and after a month, the refund still had not appeared on my credit card.  When I called to inquire about this, I was told the company decided to revoke the refund.  A multibillion dollar company revokes a $27.24 promised refund.  How's that for great customer service?!  I'll be quitting T-mobile and would not recommend them to anyone thinking of obtaining their service.  Their word means nothing.  Greedy with no ethical guidelines.",0
"Oh my, where to start? Just for them to install the internet (confirmation of the time and date) and for me to register my account, I had to contact them repeatedly for 2-3 days, like 10-15 times. NO support received ""in the system it seem right"", ""I cannot guarantee"", ""you have to download the APP to register an online account"", ""we don't know how to register an acoount from the browser"" etc... what even was that? never have i ever seen a company so incompetent",0
"I canceled service in October 2024. I called a few weeks later about a refund of the credit balance on my account. I was told that payment would be returned to my bank account after my final bill was generated on November 2. No refund arrived. It is now November 19 and every time I call, the story flips between ""sending it to your bank"" and ""We're sending you a gift card"". I still have no refund. Today, they told me my balance is zeroed out; there is nothing more they can do for me. No accountability and the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing.",0
I don’t have a complaint about wireless service or coverage. I do have a huge complaint about today’s customer Service.  Customer service was not this bad 1 - 2 years ago. Now you call and they don’t listen to you. It’s like they’re told to say you owe them money. I told the last representative that I wanted to talk to his manager and he didn’t want to transfer that call. He kept telling me I owe them money and there’s no need to talk to anyone else. It’s so frustrating and disappointing that T-Mobile hires unprofessional people and please T-Mobile hire people who speaks decent English. I’m done with T-Mobile!!,0
"Having a business account for over six years, biggest mistake was to leave Verizon and go to T-Mobile. I always went to the Bethpage store on Broadway this past January. I got new phones handed my old phones and nothing was ever applied to my account and the promotion was also never applied to my account. I have been calling T-Mobile since February And now we are in December. Not only the corporate office is giving me the runaround and saying I’m really sorry my hands are tied so is the store. At this Bethpage store the crew constantly changes every few months, which is very fishy. My bill has more than doubled and today I received a call From the business department because again I have a business account. She put me on hold she came back on the phone and gave me the same spiel, Which was I’m really sorry I know it’s frustrating. Go to another store. You do the running around. There’s nothing we can do. And if I can give them less than zero, I would",0
1canelle my service after being with t mobile for over 10 years and the continued to charge meIt event cost me and addition 375 dollars as the threatened my credit,0
I was offered a service for moving all my business lines over by James Robertson of T-Mobile via email. None of that agreement played out the way it was supposed to. No one in support will accept an email to adjust bill. I cancelled all service immediately after being told there was no way to get my bill to what was offered.,0
"I noticed I was billed twice in MarchI jump on webchatThe agent stuffs around for 15 minsMakes me fill in a form with personal detailsI input my pin code, forms is submittedMinutes later he says pin is wrong but can still helpMore time passesThen he tells me he can’t help without the pin!!!Ffs - all these companies using useless shitty webchat companies as a fake assistance point need to go out of business. If u can’t give us customer service then stop pretendingWasted time and frustration is the only outcome from using crappy operatorsAnd to lead the customer on for 20 mins is disgraceful. Hope T-Mobile is happy with the fake stats of their agents and the alleged enquiries they handle! More like increasing the distrust and frustration of customers who need resolutionsI should not have to waste an hour to find out why you double billed",0
"Thier customer service is a joke , these people don't know thier ass from a hole in the ground .  USELESS!!!  to the core just hand them your money that's all they're good for. They have no control over changing passwords it's all up to the app developer and that person has awful reviews. But the reps are carrying on like they know what to do and the information they give is all wrong and different every time  Do these ppl even really work there?  Or is this another BS move on americans??",0
Stay away from them.  Spent all day on phone with Customer service over a bill and told nothing they can do switched to them cause we're cheaper than Verizon but guess you get what you pay for they don't value you only how much money they can get out of you,0
"Last fall, my husband added a line to my phone, so total was 2 lines.Then T-mobile kept charging me 3 line for 12 monthes and I haD to call monthly for correct bill even they said bill fixed. So I cancelled one line at November 2024 before the bill due day. then they charge me $160.01 for one line. before was $50 per line. last month I got the refund, this month they charge me again the same extra bill. I have to call the bank to dispute. don't waste your time on this SCAM company !!!",0
"I have been charged, on my credit card, for 10 months for mobile hotspot service after leaving T-Mobile for a competitor.  They ""can't"" stop charging me over the phone.  I have to go into a retail location.  Would be easier to just shut down the credit card.",0
"Absolute worst service and company to deal with. I don't recommend them to anyone. Not only do they lie about products and billing, they don't honor anything they say. We canceled service within 2 weeks, Was told we had 30 days. T-mobile sent us a label to return and said it's within timeframe. We got a bill for $2300 and they say there is nothing they will do about it. So they took returned phones and still billed us for them. Worst customer service ever!!!",0
"Worst experience, Becareful , they are only nice when you sign in and join after no service .. whatsoeverBad connection, bad service, they are only care to charge youWorst overseas service but still they charge you fully Aldo you could barely can get service,Rude and unprofessional costumer service or better say no costumer service or help at all.When you call the don’t give a damn about you.They look for excuse to hang up on youThey do not keep their promises if you request for something.JustWorst phone company in USA",0
Total scam if you are a veteran. They promise Vets a better monthly price to lure them in. Then they offer a ridiculous trade in offer that makes the bill higher than if you don't qualify for a discount.,0
"I used their $50 a month internet service for around two years and it was constant problems.  I'd attempt to get support through the app and it would just report everything was fine and connected when it clearly wasn't.  I could never get a real person to respond.  When I switched to AT&T Fiber it took me six weeks to get my T-Mobile cancelled; they would respond to me and then stop replying when I held my ground about cancelling.  I finally had to take the box into a local store and they said THEY couldn't even help me cancel, but had to call a national number.  I showed them the screenshots of conversations showing I tried to cancel and asked if I could get a refund and they denied.  Then I got a bill showing they had sent my account immediately to collections for the month after I stopped using the service, two weeks into trying to cancel (I had turned off autopay, the one thing I COULD do).",0
I have my sons phone plan payments linked to my checking account and it’s on auto pay for the 29th of every month and evidently it did not come out due to we were homeless at the time and they went into my account on November 8 and just took out the payment without notifying me first which is illegal it’s unauthorized and its theft when I called the girl we just went round in circles and I hung up on her. She called back. I told her to give my money back or report you to authorities that she took out money Out of my account unauthorized and it’s theft!,0
"""After being a devoted T-Mobile customer for over a decade, the recent plunge in their customer service quality has been downright appalling. Each interaction with their support team has been a nightmare—issues are ignored, and the so-called 'assistance' is useless. It's like the company has forgotten that customers are the backbone of their business. Their promises of efficient support are nothing but empty words. I'm beyond disappointed and utterly frustrated. T-Mobile, you need to remember what customer service actually means. Shame on you.""Hope this does the trick!",0
"I can't understand why this company made it so big. Incompetent workers, customer service, high prices, worst company I'm switching after 12 years with them.",0
"Wish I could leave 0 stars. Worst customer service I have ever received from any company ever. From the beginning they tell you that you’ll receive this discount for such and such and so on. Lied about all of it. No discount for new line with phone purchase, no discount for watch purchase with line. Even said here try this internet for 30days free. Showed up on my bill in a week. When I called about not receiving the discounts discussed. They issued a $100  debit card and then canceled it after I received it. Finally switched service, paid my final bill and received another bill a month later. When I called it was another final bill for the watch line they didn’t cancel but charged me for. Called customer service and they said they couldn’t issue a refund but would issue a debit card. Never received it so I called to ask where it was and was told they wouldn’t be issuing one even after I asked for it to be documented. Nope. Run away!!!!!",0
"This is the the worst app I am so sorry I got involved with T-Mobile home Internet.It is constantly getting disconnected. I'm trying to watch a movie and all of a sudden it starts filtering you can't stay connected long enough to watch a full movie.Their Wi-Fi is horrible I went out today using directions I get halfway there and I'm stranded because their T-Mobile Wi-Fi just disappeared and I had nothing I didn't know where I was going they weren't even on my list of connections, they completely disappeared off my phone.I was only 10 minutes away from my home and they're saying that there wi-fi can only go so far, this is ridiculous. They are the worst worst app for internet. Like I said there's not a program I can watch fully without being disconnected.I'm trying to surf the Internet or play some word games you can't do it because it's so slow you get so frustrated you give up.",0
"Do not go for Tmobile, they literally scam you for money. I ordered for a T mobile hotspot, but I received a TCL tablet with sim card. When I called customer service, I was told that fake account with pin was already crerated, I have to go to a nearby t mobile store, I requested for cancellation of my account and autopay. I returned back the equipment within a  month. They have cancelled my account but not the autopay. I got a mail that I have to pay for TCL tablet, eventhough I returned it. Now I am being told that I have to go to near by T mobile store to open my closed account and ask for refund. This is my more than 6 times calling customer service and three times going to T mobile store in a month.",0
"Call to get a $7 late fee removed .because there was a discrepancy in the payment last month. and I have never been late been with the company for 12 years,and they would not do it I do not recommend this company at all",0
"This company does nothing but lie to customers constantly. I spent 8 months being promised working internet coverage and cell phone service at one end of town where it was non-existant. Instead of one month for them to fix the problem it took 9 months before they built another tower that actually worked. They also promised that T-Mobile had agreements with European countries so that my plan included internet coverage in Europe. That was a blatant lie. Out of 8 cities -- it only worked in Vienna. I bought trackers from them because they promised there would be no monthly fee. That was a lie. They started charging the monthly fees after the return window had closed and then refused to accept a return of the sealed boxes and unused trackers. After I finally cancelled all my services with T-Mobile they tried to charge me the full amount for the 4 trackers. When I disputed these charges and won the disputes with Citibank -- T-Mobile tried to bill me again for the full amount of the disputed charges and also threatened me with reporting the debt to credit agencies, even though they are bound by arbitration agreements to honor the dispute decisions in my favor by Citibank.",0
"I am receiving invoices on my email address, even though I never signed up for an account and do not have any relation with T-mobile. It is not possible to log in to T-mobile with the email address, or reset the password to enable login. T-mobile customer service says they will not help at all.",0
"T-Mobile used a bait and switch tactic to get me locked into their service. They talked me into trading two paid and unlocked iPhones for new iPhones 16s “at no cost” if I stayed with them. But they charged me anyway and claimed they made a mistake. As a senior citizen I filed a complaint with my states attorney general. Still, as of now, I’m on the hook for $1600. Run from this company",0
Tmobile sucks always messing things up over charging me really bad but I think all phone companies are,0
"I closed my account and they still took $70 from my bank account. The whole reason I dropped this company is because they keep raising their prices. I used to get $10 a month in discounts and they raised the price $10 so I don't actually get a discount anymore. I can't afford this much per month. I went with someone cheaper with the same coverage and service. When I tried to resolve this, they said they couldn't do anything.",0
Stay away they are absolutely horrible. They convinced me us to leave ATT with the promise of free phones and here we are paying for them. They even went back and listened to the recording and said sorry you are misinformed!! Run away it’s not worth it! Was in the phone 4 hours to get to that nothing resolved except the person they trained and listened to on the recording gave the wrong information. He even called us back the next day to close the deal. But they refuse to do anything.,0
Either there is no one working for T-Mobile that knows the promotions or they are all liars. I recently upgraded to the iPhone 16 I was told I didn’t qualify for the free upgrade to the 16 pro in store then when I called they told me I did qualify and didn’t understand why I was told in store that I didn’t. Long story short I was told that my bill would definitely stay the same and wouldn’t change at all. That was a lie along with a credit that was issued it just disappeared along with my trade in amount for my old phone. I’ve been with them for 23 plus years I’ve always had several lines but with my recent experience I will be changing companies completely after the current phone that was supposed to be free is paid off.If there is a lawsuit against this issue with them I’d like to join in what they are doing to customers is not legal at all. PLEASE DONT USE T-MOBILE.,0
There was a 30 day trial period for switching to t-mobile.  If you switched from another carrier to t-mobile and switched back within 30 days they would reimburse you 150.00.  We tied tmobile and were unsatisfied with their coverage and service.  we switched back to verizon witinin the 30 days of starting tmobile and called tmoble customer service and started a claim for the 150.00.  The customer service rep stated that we were within the 30 days and expect a check mailed to address.  If we did not get the check wining 30 days call back.  Today 10/10 i called customer service at tmobile and stated never received money they said that the claim was denied because i did not re-claim my 150 with in 30 days of initial claim.,0
"I was a customer of t mobile for proabaly a  YEAR maybe more,Every other Month my bill would be higher ,I would have to call them talk to one of their  managers and get it straighten out it didn't matter the next bill would be fine the next bill would always be higher, the last time was the last time  I just quit them as i told them I would if it kept happening Now I found a new company  but still have the phone from t mobile,I have no use for it but refuse to pay when they keep trying to over charge me my bill was $45.00 a month not $69.00.like i said every other month .I have kept records but might have thrown them away.they keep a log of all phone calls so I can prove if I have to what they were trying to do ,my son also quit them for the same reason.now I get warning letters along with a raise in what I owe for BEING LATE.I HOPE THEY DONT HOLD THEIR BREATH  THEY ARE DONE ROBBING ME",0
"If you want the too long don't want to read.  Do not use T Mobile.  They are a terrible company.  Pay the extra 10-15 a month per line for a real telecom provider.T Mobile as a company is simply not in compliane with Federal Trade Communication guidelines and generally does not adhear to business practices set by the local Chambers of Commerce for each and every region within the United States they operate.I decided to try out the service, it bare functioned.  The modem died, I tried to get it repaired.  They added to much friction to that process and actively refused to repair the T Mobile 5G modem.  Come today.  I have a $500 USD bill for services not rendered as they were keeping the account running for what appears to be 6 months even though it's a month to month contract (auto renew without consent is against several FTC guidelines and policies).  They made it very difficult if not impossible to cancel my account.  They've designed so that you have to call them and they spend 30 minutes trying to keep you as a customer.  I'm sure I cancelled the account in the past but here it is.I called today to see if they could make it right.  They made course of action except to pay the debt collection agency.  Their service was sub par and quite frankly it was a terrible experience overall.  If you operate an Authorized T-Mobile reseller or repair center.  Quite frankly I would find a more honest company.  The negative karma you're generating working for T-Mobile will come back to haunt you.A final note.  To any open source projects such as OpenStack or any other project managed by the CNCF or OpenInfra Foundation.  Please do not accept code commits from a company which does not operate ethically and within the guidelines of what I believe are pretty normal business practices.  Their customer service personal are trained to ""handle"" customers, they are not trained to resolve issues.",0
I’ve had T Mobile for about a year and half now.They made an arrangement with me to pay a bill but they made the arrangement for back to back days and I told them that I could only afford the one payment. I made the payment but they shut off my service. After discussing the matter with them I made another arrangement and they promised not to turn the service off They turned it off twice in less than two weeks. They did this after promising that they wouldn’t. The rep then lied to me even though I have the text messages from 611,0
Keep and switch is a scam. I was told by the representative when I purchased the phone that I was eligible for a promo credit. After completing the application I was denied because the information was entered incorrectly. The rep said she would reenter and to check my status again in 30 days.  Denied again.  Called customer service and they told me that it was denied due to a duplicate that said it had already been awarded. It was escalated to another team to fix and I’m still waiting. I submitted the original request on 8/15. It’s now 10/15 and TMobile can’t seem to fix this issue that is with their own system. Their customer service team just consistently apologizes but they haven’t been able to do anything. I will continue to call until this is resolved but rest assured I won’t be telling anyone to use TMobile. $750 later.  Maybe I’ll eventually get my $$$. Think twice before switching.,0
Have been with this company for a while and always paid my bill. When one of my family members who is on my account died they wouldn't even extend my due date. So that I could pay and attend the funeral. Just so they could charge me and additional 80.00 in late fees. This company is all about thier money not their customers. They simply do not care.,0
"SCAM ARTISTS AND CON ARTISTS!! I have been using tmobile home internet in our camper since 2023. I went with this option because I was told by multiple employees including the store manager that I could take it on the road to use in multiple locations as I live in my camper. For $55 a month I couldn't complain. I have been using this for over a year with NO issues and now am being told I need to pay 2.9 times more ($160 on autopay) for their new ""away plan"" for the EXACT same service I have been using. The home internet will now be geo locked to one location so you can't take it anywhere. The rich have to stay rich and they will find ways to make more money for providing the same service",0
"I can’t believe this guy from T-Mobile have the nerve to ask me when I call back. Are you calling back to join back up with T-Mobile? I said are you out of your goddamn mind I closed down my account on October 5 and I went in the store, I said I would like to pay off everything I owe so I paid $233 on October 5 a month later I receive a bill for $312 and they said this is my final bill. I know what was the last bill that I paid they’re just making up a bunch of crap we get this. My phone still has a Sim lock so I just called up today. This is six months later and even though I paid that $312 they charged interest on it I’m telling you right now stay far away from T-Mobile. They are the crook and worst company you have ever been with in your life. My company and me. I am done with Verizon Print. I feel bad that Sprint went to T-Mobile cause Sprint was decent and T-Mobile destroyed T-Mobile you guys need to go to hell you’re crooked you’re dishonest your liars and you’re the f in  tallyban this company has bin laden written all over it",0
"T Mobile has changed in the three plus years since we joined.  When we signed up, we opted for the then highest rate plan. Now that plan is not only a ""legacy"" plan, we receive fewer considerations for deals than someone with their bottom most rate plan, which is still a lower price than we pay.T mobile basically changed nothing but the name and wants to charge my family more per moth for the privilege of signing up for that.When you call customer service, they will make a deal with you, but tell you that the ""back office "" needs to approve it.  Then they will wait two weeks and finally call you to tell you that the ""back office"" has declined the deal and try to force you into the more costly new plans at no benefit to you.This is the essence of dishonest negotiations.Meanwhile, ATT is offering essentially the same service, at a lower price, and will still extend customers the trade in deals.  I think that it is only a matter of time before we change back to ATT.",0
"No one cares or knows what they are doing. I have a mechanical issue with my phone and have been bounced around between T-Mobile and the insurance company, Assurant, a million times. Then, they finally agree that it is on T-Mobile to replace it. I filed my replacement over the phone and it said I would get a replaced in 24 hours. 48 hours later, no phone, so I call, get bounced around, and find out it was denied, but no one told me. Then, I have to trouble shoot including factory resetting my phone, which is fine. It doesn't work and I am told a replacement will be sent and it will be an upgrade as mine is not available. I don't get an email in 24 hours as they say I will, so I call 30 hours later to find out a replacement order was never put in. This time it is replaced, but they won't honor the upgrade. They say they will review the phone logs and get back to me regarding what the rep promised me. A few days later, no call, so I contact them again. I promised they will review the phone logs and get back to me. Three days later, nothing, so I contact them again. Supposedly, she called, but she didn't leave a message or make in any notes in my account. No one is willing to look at the calls, contact either rep that said they would look at the calls, or contact the rep who made the promise. About 10 days dealing with this. After almost 20 years with T-Mobile and I am walking away and will NEVER EVER come back.",0
"I’ve been dealing with T-Mobile for months, and it has been an absolute nightmare. In June 2024, I ordered a 5G internet plan and a Go 5G phone plan. Despite never receiving the order, I’ve been charged every month. I've made countless calls and sent emails, but there's been no resolution. Every time I speak with a customer service agent, I'm told a different story, full of empty promises and lies. It’s beyond frustrating.What’s worse is that I’ve been receiving constant threats that the charges will be sent to collections, despite their reassurances that it would be corrected. It's been over three months, and I still haven’t received a refund for the order that was never delivered. This company is acting more like a scam than a reliable service provider. It's unbelievable how such a large company can operate with this level of dishonesty and incompetence.T-Mobile, you need to do better. I feel like I’ve been duped, and no customer should have to go through this! Beware of their false promises and lack of accountability",0
"I have been with T-mobile for many, many years the call quality is solid  however, the customer service is by far the most subpar, well below standard customer service I have ever dealt with agents and supervisors are apparently only allowed to stay on script and can in no way vary to provide actual customer service. The automated system is set up to ask you the same questions a minimum of 3 times each before it will transfer you to an agent and the agents make it clear that they will do no more if not less the what the automated system can do, and do not let me even get started on the procedures they make up and put in place that get you to go into the store where the store associates then look at you lost and say “I’m not sure why they told you to come in for that? We will have to call customer service!” An overseas agent set up my initial business account over the phone and completely misspelled my name. It to 2 years to partially clear this up and the random name now appears on my credit report. I sadly wish I was making this up lol. This is just on scenario.",0
"Had 3 online support people straight up lie about correcting an issue.  They just told me what they thought I wanted to hear.  One actually looked legit, had email exchanges, ect.  Had 24 hours to sign a digital document but it was cancelled about 10 hours, never giving me a chance to even see the email and sign.  Then the last one told me to watch my inbox for a confirmation which never came.  They intentionally lied, and I would advise anyone to stay far away from this unethical place which cuts your unlimited Internet to unusable speeds worse than 1997 dial up.  Now I am done with them and want to spread the word about this terrible place.  Yes I have screenshots, emails, confirmation numbers to T-Mobile manipulative games.  They wasted my time, and never had decent intentions of resolution.  They are awful, they lie to customers and it's time to tell the world about T-Mobiles ethics (they have none), because they do not need to be in business any longer due to these practices.  They have had class action lawsuits about this in the past, never learned the lesson.",0
"Horrible customer service. I was a 20 year customer and the past couple of years the customer service has taken a nose dive. After T-Mobile customer service kept messing with my account because autopay failed to work, I was locked out of my account without a PIN and there after customer service would not help me since I had no PIN.I ported my numbers out to another company and T-Mobile continued to make it difficult to even pay my last bill. I paid my final bill using the web page address in the final bill letter to pay as guest. I thought I was finally done but that was not the case.I ended up getting a call from a collection agent stating I owe T-Mobile for the final bill. I provided REF# from my payment and I still could not get it resolved.I ended up filling a complaint with FCC and got an email from T-Mobile Executive Response Team. I called the ERT member as asked in the email and we finally spoke. ERT argued with me telling that the account was not in collection and disagreed with me about being called by a collection agent. He was able to locate payment and apply to my final bill. But even though the issue was resolved the customer service was still bad and only got resolution since it was a FCC complaint.",0
"fri pm switched to t-mobile, clerk said he could transfer my contacts and pictures,  did not happen.  went back mon to have them try again.  young female clerk could not make the transfer, or answer other questions on the cat s22. all she could say was she hates this phone. switched back to my other carrier.  lost $41.90 for nothing.",0
"Signed up for T-Mobile Home Internet about 6 months ago. I was promised a $200.00 gift card for switching from Spectrum. Guess what, NO gift card. I have talked to them on the phone, text and email. All with the same answer, it was approved but not sent. It's been 2 months now. No holding my breath.",0
"Shady, shady, shady. They told me in order to get an upgrade (mind you, I haven't upgraded in over 3 years), i need to upgrade my plan - a $24 increase per month. Without doing this, I have to pay $490 for a new phone up front and the rest gets billed monthly. I upgrade my plan,  to then see that now I have to pay $700 upfront and I'm told that's a great deal and perk by tmobile. I have been with them for over 17 years and can do much better with Verizon,  AT&T or spectrum mobile. They didn't want to let me return my plan to what it was before, but was able to finally get them to. I guess tmobile is hurting after that huge law suit they have to pay everybody out over the data beach so to make up for it, they give you misleading information, catchy buzz words and lies to con you into spending evergreen more money on their awful product.Will never trust them again and I'm leaving them after 17 years. (Also now that I'm looking at other carriers, I see average rates for my $100 plan with tmobile ranges anywhere from $50-$80 with other carriers. Wish I left these shady people sooner.",0
"T-Mobile is dishonest and disgusting. My problems are twofold. Since the beginning on 2024, I had three warranty exchanges of my Samsung S22 handset. With each warranty exchange, T-Mobile sent a LOCKED device although my initial phone was unlocked. Calling customer service is useless as there is no resolution despite the seemingly understanding attitude from representatives who are not allowed to deviate from the script. Among the various answers for receipt of a locked phone were the exchanged phone must be on the account 90 days. Parenthetically, I paid a fee on each exchange although I was replacing a defective phone T-Mobile sent me less than one month prior.  The second issue that occurred twice involves T-Mobile stating they did not receive the damaged phone and then billing a $1500 no-return fee. In each instance, T-Mobile eventually found the phone the returned - one month later - stating the wrong IMEI was keyed in when received at their warehouse. Twice?? It seems T-Mobile has internal theft problem and would rather pass the expense onto the consumer rather than clean their house.",0
All I have to say is SCAM ALERT.Don’t trust them they will SCAM you.Just read all their reviews. Everyone is saying they’ve been scammed and my wife and I have experienced ourselves. I would highly recommend leaving them and going to ATT. Same plan better service and at least you know you won’t be scammed,0
There is no way in Hell I would do business with any company that associates themseives with Snoop Dogg!! What a piece of garbage.,0
"T-Mobile in person has mostly helpful people, but many things need to be done online or on the phone.  The 611 phone customer service people are so incredibly inept it is 😤😡. I just sat on the phone for 2 hours and they could not set up a simple account for me. They kept putting me on hold without explaining what the problem was. When they asked for my social, I told the woman I had been a victim of identity theft, so I would have to get off the phone with her and release the freeze on my credit account. She said no need, they just needed my social on file. I sat for another hour on the phone before someone in the credit department came on to say I needed to release the freeze on my credit. I said ""I told the other woman that an hour ago!"" What is wrong with you? Do your people not know what their job is? Why does the person setting up the account NOT know what she is asking?!",0
"T-Mobile states that once you agree to their plan, you bill will never go up. Ok. Sounds great!! Count me in!! Uh, except that is not true. My first bill was higher and the second bill was higher than that!! After spending hours on the phone with customer service, ""we can't do anything. The store manager will have to make those changes"". The store manager quoted me a price that was the correct price, but the bill is more. Oh guess what? Since you've been trying to get this problem fixed, ""we've suspended your service"". Now that's how you treat a new customer!! Lie to them. Charge them more than they've agreed to, then, cut them off when they ask what about the ""you bill will never go up"". Outstanding. No wonder they don't check trustpilot and respond to their reviews. They know exactly what they are doing. As always, should've checked trust pilot before committing. Lesson learned.",0
They said we would get 4 new phones for switching.  Guess what older phones aren't eligible for trade in.  Coverage area stinks in our area.Too bad we switched from Verizon.,0
I was scam with T-Mobil and I was a customer since the call voice stream  the total amount was 691.00 they said I had contact and everyone knows they no longer do contacts. I left them because I went to their Georgia Ave location and someone hack into my and from this happened it was down hill for me. Please beware of t-mobile. This why I changed my services.,0
I bought a screen protector “for life” for $50. meaning - they said - if mine cracks I just stop by the store and get a brand new one for free.well mine cracked and I went to the store and they said they have no records of me buying it but if I want I should purchase it again so I can have it.so basically they’re telling me to pay twice for the same service. I went to different T-Mobile stores and they say the same thing.ABSOLUTE SCAM. DO NOT recommend.,0
Wifi goes out every 15 minutes. They’ve claimed to be “fixing” it multiple times and I’ve seen little to 0 progress. Do better.,0

Had trouble from the very beginning. Overtime the service got worse and worse. Finally cut it off today. We have been without internet for days now.,0

"I became a New T-Mobile customer in December of 2023. I got reeled into getting the 5G Home Cell internet service on a trial basis. I got COVID and was unable to bring the unite back in until after the trial period ended, on January 23, 2024. I brought it back because it sucked worse than my DSL. I live in a rural area. T-Mobile did not give a crap & said I would be charged a prorate for the time I had it. Fine, I just didn't want the service and so I asked the T-Mobile rep to cancel it. I also called T-Mobile right after, to let them know to cancel it. T-Mobile's website was problematic. Many times, I was kicked off the website or the website was non-responsive and I was unable to see my account online and so I gave up. I trusted that T-Mobile would charge me for just the cell phone service I signed up for. BIG MISTAKE! I was able to get online without a problem 2 days ago and noticed that T-Mobile is still charging me for equipment I don't have and service I cancelled, that I cannot even utilize without the equipment I turned into T-Mobile back on January 23, 2024. I immediately called T-Mobile and their customer service rep said that they have record of me returning the equipment on January 23, 2024 but they don't have any record of the separate call to them I made, cancelling the 5 G internet service that I cannot even use without the equipment I turned into them. T-Mobile is refusing to refund the $540.00 of false charges over the past 12 months. the T-Mobile rep blamed me for the charges for the service, I was not receiving, because I did not monitor my account & that I did not call T-Mobile to let them know I was being charged for a service I cancelled on January 23, 2024. I am on auto-payment and paperless billing that the T-Mobile's customer service representative sold me on and gave me discounts for agreeing to use, when I signed up. I feel that T-Mobile promotes auto pay & paperless billing on purpose, so that you don't catch T-Mobile right away, in their theft. These charges are fraudulent and T-Mobile knowingly stole my money for equipment and service T-Mobile knows I didn't have and am not even able to use without their equipment. My 5G T-Mobile cell internet # was 928-266-7382. I have filed a complaint with the FCC & the FTC. I will look online to see what other agencies I can file a complaint with, to get my stolen money back.",0
This company has been nothing but difficult to communicate with and would highly not recommend. Made a great product impossible to deal with.,0
"BUYER BEWARE!! The location at Meadowood Mall in Reno, Nevada is a third-party contracted locale. And they have NO IDEA how T-Mobile works. We just left T-Mobile after 15 years as our carrier because of their incompetence, and due to every customer service rep, retail clerk, tech support, manager, heck, you name it, we've spoken with for the last year, who refused to repair the problem created by the creatures at this store. No one wanted to fix the clearly erroneous handling of our new phones and watches by the idiot who sold them to us. We were passed around, placated, and eventually they all went silent.Our little over $300 month bill jumped to almost $600, simply because the person didn't know how to input information, and no one would fix it afterward. We went to three (3) different T-Mobiles in our town, and nothing. Have spent hours on the phone with these cretins. Nothing. I even emailed a manager at the location on Keystone Avenue, AFTER he asked me to. (A little bit after he told me to, to be clear.) Still. Nothing.Stay away from T-mobile. They don't care about you, until you leave. Then you get a 'sad face' from the guy unlocking your phones, and 'why are you leaving?'. Um, read our notes. They are 10 times more lengthy and detailed than this review. Literally cried in two of their stores because of how we were treated. Go to Spectrum, Verizon, heck, get a burner phone. Do anything but business with these people. They want your money, and care less about your loyalty.",0
"I left t mobile for spectrum, and they hit me with a $173 bill after I had already paid their ""final bill"" at the time I switched carriers.  Total scam!!!",0
Customer service is a total JokeThe 5G service is great but the app and support are embarrassing bad.,0
"Three times I encountered this TMoble Rep from Westfield Topanga Mall, Los Angeles, Ca and the experience was just rude and traumatic.  The first experience was a roughly a year ago.  I came in the shop and he was standing by the door.  I inquired about upgrading my phone and he was impolite and sounded not interested to help me, he simply said, ""ok choose your phone in the displays"" and did not even offer to open my account.  I dismissed the experience and went out of the shop discourage about pursuing my intention to upgrade.  I never forget his face.  then almost a year later I went back with my wife to ask about the status of our account (how much we pay monthly, are we eligible for upgrade etc) the first thing he said to me was ""you don't know how much you pay on your bill? sounding sarcastic and irritated that i requested him to open my account.  I let that experience go because i was tired and in a hurry.  the third encounter with AJ was today Nov 17, 2024.  Two hours ago. And it was horrible. We came in with the intention to upgrade our phones.  He opened our account and told us that we need to pay our overdue bill first.  We were surprised of the unpaid bill because we thought we are on auto debit.  But he said sarcastically ""No you haven't paid last month's bill"".  that what it means by ""overdue"" sounding like we don't understand what the word means.  So this finally into me and reacted with all the bottled feelings i have had in the previous two encounters.  I told him this is the 3rd he has been rude to us and he accused me of making up stories and of raising my voice. And he said he has the right to refuse service and told us to leave in front of all the customers.  He is a liability to your brand.  The lady representative who was beside us was not helpful either. I know the shop is closing for the day but that is no reason to be horrible to the customer.  This experience is not acceptable.",0
"""I have had the absolute worst experience with T-Mobile. Due to their negligence and lack of competent customer service, they wrongfully sent my account to collections! Despite making all payments on time and having no prior issues, they somehow managed to mismanage my account information, leading to unnecessary and undeserved damage to my credit score.When I reached out to their customer service to rectify their mistake, I was met with endless excuses, confusion, and no clear path to a resolution. Instead of taking accountability, their representatives passed me around from department to department with no one willing to fix their mistake. It’s evident that customer care is NOT a priority for T-Mobile.Their incompetence in handling this situation has caused me stress, wasted my time, and left me to deal with the unnecessary burden of clearing my name with the collections agency. I trusted T-Mobile with my service and they completely let me down. If you value your credit and your peace of mind, stay far away from T-Mobile!""",0
Worse customer service and always steals money from customers through overcharged bills,0
We got a hot spot for our camp ground and it didn’t work at all. Spent time on the phone with  a person trying to troubleshoot our issue.  The issue was the hot spot wasn’t strong enough for our area.  We had an emergency and needed the WiFi and we were out of luck.  So the very next day. We went to a store and got a portable WIFI.  Which has served us well.  So now we have a hot spot that we want to return and they are making us pay for something that doesn’t work for a total of 2 years. I think this is horrible customer service.  We have our cell phone service through them and they do t really care. They are still making us be responsible for this bill. We are retired and can’t afford to pay for something that doesn’t work.  I am so frustrated with the service that we have received. What are we supposed to do?,0
"They make so much profit, but why is it impossible to make a good website for refilling your prepaid card???? Never again",0
"My experience with T-Mobile has been nothing short of a nightmare. I own a fully paid-off iPhone 14 Pro Max, and after renewing my business with T-Mobile by getting an iPhone 15 on credit, I reached out to unlock my old phone so I could send it to my brother, who is serving in the U.S. Army overseas.Initially, they assured me that unlocking the phone would be easy. However, after 10 days of waiting, they suddenly claimed I was 36 hours late on my bill and pressured me to pay. Despite the fact that the iPhone 14 is no longer tied to my account, I paid the bill, only to receive even more excuses for why they couldn’t unlock it.The absurdity is that this paid-off phone is free to be activated by any random person wanting to sign up for a T-Mobile line, even a stranger or my ex-wife. I even called pretending to be someone else, provided them with the IMEI number, and they were ready to sign me up with no questions asked—as long as it was with them! Ironically, they claim they can't unlock the phone.To add insult to injury, my brother was ready to sign up with T-Mobile but needed the phone unlocked to use a local SIM while deployed. Instead of facilitating his needs, T-Mobile’s ridiculous policies have forced them to lose a military servicemember’s business. They’ve also lost mine; as soon as I finish paying off the new phone I bought from them, I’ll be moving on.If you’re thinking about choosing T-Mobile, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. You won’t be able to sell or gift your old phones; they’ll just become expensive trash. Instead of upholding their legal obligations, T-Mobile drags their feet and makes excuses. They’re full of it, and I can’t recommend them to anyone seeking reliable and ethical service!",0
"I was previously a T-Mobile customer for years. They kept increasing the bill, and the customer service continued to be lower. The phone prices and incentives were less and less. I got really tired of paying full price for a new phone every two years and not getting a discount or any kind of incentive for my kiddos phone line. After I switched my number to a new service, they sent me a bogus charge of $103.46, claiming ""equipment not returned."" What equipment? I had my phone fully paid off and I didn't have any other equipment? I tried to call customer service and they said they couldn't help me without some six digit pin. I had no idea what it was because I never use a pin when I call they verify me through a text message. When I escalated the call to a supervisor, the supervisor basically said they couldn't help me either and I had to go into a T-Mobile store with my ID to be verified. I understand having security measures but when you're not even a customer anymore and you can't even have a manager tell you what the charge is for over the phone and that's the only information you're requesting that is a broken system. I offered to give my drivers license number my Social Security number my email address, have an email verification, and five other solutions but they refused to do anything without some obscure pin I don't even remember making when I first signed up..Needless to say, I will never use this service again and I don't recommend anyone else comes here unless you want to overpay for your phones and not be able to be helped with your bill.I say this as somebody who works in customer support, and knows how systems can be created to truly help people.",0
They took 1731.96 out of my account for phones I sent back. The shipping labels proved they received them and they still charged me and refused to give me a refund.,0
"I have not received my rebates!  I have reached out a total of 5 times-months later no rebate!  I will be calling corporate tomorrow, followed up by a call to the BBB.  Nothing but lies, deception, aggravation and anxiety dealing with T-mobile!  You call and the call gets directed to the Philippines.  Second, i specifically asked to speak to the “retention team”.  I asked them “why should I stay with T-Mobile?  I switched carriers AND bundled home internet.  There was an incentive of a total of 300$ in rebates.  Thats not true, I have not received my rebate incentives.  The day I switched carriers verizon offered home wifi and for less money than t-mobile.   So please tell me why should I stay with T-Mobile?  Your job is a retention specialist tell me…why should i stay?” (Anne) listed a bunch of services ATT, VERIZON and many other competitors offer.  She discussed my bill that was due 2 days ago.  I explained “I was aware of my obligations, and told her that they did not answer my question! “.  Now they got a supervisor on the phone.  He was about as useful as a pair of tits on a bull!  Regurgitated the same bs as the previous person.  I asked him the very specific question…”why should I continue to be a T-mobile customer?  He went on about the services and i told him (Dave) your competitors offer that too and for less money…The retention team did not answer the question and failed at their task.i was with ATT cellular for 20 years (and probably another 20 before that with the old landline!  I left them, because I did not feel valued.  (New customers were getting better deals than myself and i had to ask for comparable discounts.)  i was with verizon for 3 years and switched for the incentives.  Like i mentioned earlier the day i switched they came out with a promo for less money in a home internet plan than what i was NEWLY paying at t-mobile.  Now no rebates?  Yes I will be reaching out to Bbb, corporate, and bringing this to the attention of some litigious lawyers.  Bring on the class action suit!WTG- Mike Seivert!",0
T-Mobile really sucks. They gave me a price for two internets at $60 a month. Three people from the store said that a week later I get a bill from them for $90. I haven't even done my trial. And they're already charging me. So I go back in the store to say it's supposed to be only $60. Will I get a different guy? And he says oh those people were misinformed. They didn't know the sale went off so they wouldn't honor it. So I brought my stuff back before I even finished my trial.. called them to get my $90 back and you have to have a PIN number so I had to go back to the store and figure out what my PIN number was. Finally a month later they send me out a statement saying that I have a credit of $52 which is BS. So I call him to tell him no. You owe me $90. They can't help me because I need a PIN number which I don't have which I don't know. So they can't help me at all. I have to go back to the store to get a PIN number. If you're thinking about using T-Mobile don't please don't,0
It's ridiculous that their system requires I remember account number when I have been using online services only.IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD  and aggravating that I can't even contact assistance through the chat without remembering the account number.,0
"If I could leave a zero I would.  I signed up for the internet service, which didn't work well in my home.  I cancelled it literally days later.  The process to cancel was easy and the person who helped me was great.  The following month I get a bill for $2.50.  I go online to try to pay the bill and am unable to get into my account since it is closed.  I attempt to pay as a guest, no luck.  I open a chat for help.  They tell me that I need to call to pay.  So, the next day, I call to make the payment.  Of course t-mobile uses a call center somewhere outside of America and the person I speak with speaks broken English, so explaining the situation and understanding him is not ideal.  He tells me I need to go onto the app to create a pin in order to verify who I am, so that I can make a payment.  We go back and forth and I finally ask to speak to a manager, which he refuses to transfer me to.  So even though I have my account number and am able to verify any information they need me to, they are unwilling to let me make a payment without a pin.  Which is interesting since I didn't need a pin to actually create an account with new service.  Makes perfect sense.  So now, I will have to waste more of my time to go into the store for $2.50.  Thanks T-mobile for making it so difficult to simply pay a bill.",0
The worst company ever. They’ve blocked everything without reason. It’s says I haven’t paid the bill even though I paid on time and never missed any. The internet is not working most of the time. It’s scam,0
"I've been experiencing some ongoing issues with my phone, and after contacting T-Mobile, I was able to get a replacement device. However, the replacement turned out to be defective as well. I reached out to T-Mobile again, and they provided another replacement, which also had issues. Frustrated with the situation, I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to seek assistance in resolving the matter and obtaining a fully functional phone.After filing the complaint, I was contacted by a T-Mobile representative named George, who informed me that the only option available was to provide me with a fifth refurbished phone. When I expressed my concerns and asked why I couldn't receive a new phone given the recurring problems, he mentioned that they didn't have the specific model I had in brand new condition. He also suggested that the only alternative would be for me to purchase a new phone.As a long-standing business customer of T-Mobile for the past eight years, I'm disappointed with the treatment I've received and the inability to resolve this issue in a satisfactory manner.",0
They  charge too much for this sh** box.  It 's always stuck on the low setting  and you have to unplug it every time to get  my television to work . I cant watch golf now. Switc h to get your club on . Bossman Husk.,0
"T-Mobile uses deceptive promotions, by saying you have to be targeted to qualify while at the same time trying to get you to change plans when in the detail description of the promotions never mentions anything about having to be targeted, I am a customer of over 20 years dating back to Sprint",0
T-Mobile is a complete damn scam. I paid the bill. That’s why I got rid of my phone. I didn’t like the service I’m on the phone talking to it’s  cut off. I paid the bill. They bill me for $1.25 keep adding me fees for Phone that I don’t have. That’s why I got rid of the complete scam.,0

I gave 1 star because it was the only way I would be able to write this review they careless about your situation at all it's like my phone was hacked I just kept getting an echo or when I dial a number I would get nothing but the phone would hang up on its on this went on for 4 day technician suppose to call back didn't happen 09.29/2024 to present this happen billing cycles change when their ready to change them if your out of work and can't pay your bill T mobile could care less even though their is a past record of you paying the bill 3 days later they still got their payment so no I would not recommend T mobile to no one un reliable they lie allot say what they think you want to hear,0
The worst company and network carrier ever.,0
Very bad services. Extra charges that are not suppose to be there.,0
"I was with Tmobile for over 20 years. The only payment I missed was after Hurricane Wilma in like 2004. I didn't have service that entire month. It all started in June when I returned a old Samsung Flip phone 3. The Screensaver separates at the fold. It is my 3rd one. They sent me a refurbished one. When I sent it back on time!!!! I saved the receipt it was never scanned at the warehouse. Long story short, 5 months later, 12 hours on the phone and 2 trips to the store. They constantly took out and put in $1100 and $2200 out of an account that I only use to pay bills. Not only does it come out. It is constantly ""pending"". So I have multiple times it goes in and out. So I call all the time. I was very nice in the beginning. Wells Fargo told me to immediately take them off bill pay. After it was finally settled. It happened again!!! My 0 balance went to $1279 because they kept hitting me with late fees. The customer service rep said I should have had the money to cover the $1100 in good faith. 17× my $65 bill. Now I have $2200 in my Wells Fargo account that they can't take out!!! I called them and let them know that I have their money. The lady got me so mad. I went to Patriot Mobile. I am waiting on the SIM card. I called one more time to talk to a supervisor. Another 44 minutes on hold. So now 12 hours. He said he was the number one guy in the entire USA at Tmobile. He said it would be 3-5 days until he EMAILS his team. I said you are a phone company and you can't call them? I said you don't understand...I am not going to be your customer in 5 days! They don't give a crap!! It is a bunch of kids and foreigners. They don't care about the company. They can't deal with a 61 year old retired buisinessman who doesn't tolerate foolishness. Find another company.",0
I was talking with a customer service manager about resolving a bill issue and they were going to help out if I made a specific payment which I did and they were going to follow up the next business day to finish the agreement by that time they went and deducted the original payment which ended up to 460 total and been trying to rectify the situation but not getting anywhere no matter who I speak with in customer service they all basically say we don't care.,0
"Honestly,  had a great experience up to 9/24-9/26.I have recently had lost my job and had a temporary part time job and had made a payment arragement that I really thought I could make it work.When I realized I would not be able to pay I called,  spoke to a rep.  All she could do was take my payment off so that checking account wouldnt overdraft. This was 9/22. I was told to call back on 9/24 after suspension to see what I could do.Chat on 9/24, the rep has no notes (I guess they don't write those on accounts anymore) so I have to repeat the whole process again.  They tell me there's nothing they can do. Even when I try to set up a payment for the 27th (I had a very small amount coming in). Nothing they can do.9/25 my van gets a radiator leak and hurricane Helene forms. I'm using chat,  had to go through the process all over,  get nothing but tolf to call the 1888 number because the hurricane might change that.   I call and start the process AGAIN.   Nope,  can't help me.   I guess knowing a customer out there who might not be able to contact loved ones in a deadly weather emergency is A OK morally.At this point,  I'm just curious if my phones are paid off,  because this isn't ok. Im suspended at this point, so I'm using my works wifi to use the chat feature.  Rep 5, after explaining the entire process with updates has to START THE ENTIRE PROCESS OVER.   Gets me to sign a paper to get approved for something (i think just to allow me to pay the entire bill on oct 11).  Talks me they will update me, but it'll take a few hours.   This was 12pm.  By 4pm still hadn't heard anything,  so started a chat with a rep 6 who HAS TO START THE PROCESS OVER and informs me that my letter was rejected (wasn't informed at all) and after a pissed off conversation,  I'm approved to pay 50$ on Friday, the suspension free is waived (60$) and i could make an arrangement for the rest.Final day 9/26:  I get paid early,  i start up a chat to pay the 50$ that I was promised abs told to pay.AND I HAVE TO START THE PROCESS OVER.I now am expected to pay the past due amount (not the 50$). And ""chat"" rep says they're ""limited"" in what they can do.   I literally show her screenshots of what was promised.Now they tell me to wait 24 hours for approval.  I cussed her out.I end up calling the 611 number and start the process for the 8th time.   I no longer have to 50$, i no longer have the 60$ service fee taken off and the ""computer"" can't even help me with the arragement (the dates aren't what I said I can do).Is some of this my fault? ABSOLUTELY.My issue is the lack of detail note taking that assists with helping reps deal with customers who have been speaking to several people.My issue is the lack of transparency when one rep says something can be done and it can't be done by another one.My issue is the lack of flexibility that reps used to have to assist customers whose lives just got slammed with too much stuff at once.Asking your customers to beg friends and family for money is not ok.  That customer may not have a friend or family.   There are people without support systems.Leaving your reps as shark bait for upset customers is a really crappy thing to do to employees.An inflexible computer system that doesn't leave any places for reps to assist with customer service leads to irate customers.After this experience I felt unseen,  not listened to,  and unimportant.That's why I'm leaving.",0
This company has gotten to be the most scandalous company I have ever seen they are liars and they are thieves and beware beware people don't do not do business with them unless it's prepaid and then even then I would be cautious!I went on their chat to see about possibly getting a data Sim only which would be about 10 bucks a month I signed up for it next thing you know they charge my account for $75 and they had five lines added on to this without my knowledge they dropped the letter out of my email so that I wouldn't be notified and they hid this from me for days finally one of the representatives actually said I'm going to tell you the truth you have five lines on your account! I went through hell and high water they didn't want to give me the money back the $75 they took out of my bank account they told me they would refund it for all the hassle they never did I had to shut everything down completely and now they're telling me I have to wait 45 days for my money back this is a scam people they're holding it so they can build interest off of it this is a feeding Lion Company who uses global employees you don't want to deal with global employees they're the worst! I am terminally ill with cancer and I don't have time for this and I've had to call two or three times a day every day since the 28th of September to try to get this stuff straightened out it's been nothing but a sheer nightmare I'm getting a lawyer and I'm also going to turn them into the Ada American Disability Association I'm a vulnerable adult and that is abuse and it's finest.,0
"T-Mobile is not allowed to take and sell your personal information as a telephone service provider.  So T-Mobile invented T-Mobile Tuesdays (a “gift” lottery) to enable them to take and sell your personal data, and they created various means to force/trick you into signing up whether or not you want to.The trap that I fell into (and plainly am not the first) is that if one signs up for T-Mobile Home Internet service, the only way to configure the T-Mobile router/modem in one’s home (e.g., to choose a name and password for your WiFi) is to use a specific T-Mobile app on one’s phone, and one cannot sign into the T-Mobile app without signing up for T-Mobile Tuesdays.  The T-Mobile Tuesdays terms and conditions are a near complete surrender of all of your rights, specifically including the rights to your personal data including your location data.So, T-Mobile is selling an over-the-air carrier service (presumably under an FCC tariff) that is crippled at the user end unless the user agrees to an unbelievably onerous set of terms and conditions that, among other things, allows the disclosure of your personal information.If one thinks that I am kidding about how onerous the terms and conditions are, here are a few quotes (available online on the T-Mobile Tuesdays T&Cs page):“… this contract includes indemnities to the Sponsor from you, a limitation of your rights and remedies, binding arbitration of claims, waiver of class action claims and waiver to the right to trial by jury.”  For those not familiar, “indemnities” is where you agree to be responsible for the problems of T-Mobile Tuesdays – you have to take care of the billion-dollar corporation.“By entering the Sweepstakes, Participants unconditionally: […]  b. grant (and agree to confirm that grant in writing) Sponsor, the Prize Partner and each of their respective designees to use Prize Winner’s name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed (including, but not limited to publishing the Prize Winner’s name on Sponsor’s and the Prize Partner’s Instagram and/or Facebook pages), in perpetuity, without further compensation, except in Tennessee and where prohibited by law; and c. agree that Participant’s wireless service provider may release any Participant’s phone number(s) to the Sponsor or its designees for use in contacting Participant and determining Participant’s eligibility to receive the prize.”“To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, by entering, each Participant (and guest, if applicable) and each of their agents, assignees, executors and successors agree to indemnify, defend, hold harmless and fully release and forever discharge each of the Released Parties and their respective shareholders from and against any and all liabilities, costs, claims, alleged claims, demands, duties, rights, agreements, promises, damages, injuries, losses, expenses, liens and debt actions of any kind, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, whether now known or unknown, unforeseen or foreseen, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, participation in the Sweepstakes, including without limitation, personal injury or death, loss of enjoyment, or other harm or loss of any nature whatsoever caused or contributed to by or arising out of participation in this Sweepstakes or resulting from acceptance, possession, quality, use or misuse of a prize. The Released Parties are not responsible for any additional expenses, omissions or delays resulting from any acts of any government or authority.”  Yep, you get to the pay the attorney fees for these big corporations to defend themselves against any wrongdoing, including a wrong done to you!But hey, at least then you can pick a WiFi name and password for your T-Mobile Home internet.  Congratulations!",0
"Stay away from this company!! their service is horrible, they lie and are untrustworthy! after me and my wife paid our devices off (with account up to date) and being a customer over a year, they would not unlock our devices after couple attempts and speaking to different customer service (after they initially said they would but needed to wait first was 48 hr then 72 hr then more excuses after that), there was always an excuse. and giving us the run around about this, then asking why we need our phones unlocked? all to keep stealing from you! all this does is frustrate the customer and making them want to leave even more! they need to do better, but I am done dealing with them! do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
Had problem with phone got no help they told me I had to go to repair shop I could not get hardly any call's   I will not recommend them to anybody.went to them many times never got help,0
"Some how it is hard to say that is there a worse cell phone provider than Straight Talk. T-Mobile has made the bottom of the list of all cell service providers. Reps make many excuses and try to make the company rules work for them and thrown the customer under the bus. Corporate stores vs authorized dealers are so different that they do not align with corporate. The sales rep at Walmart was a complete liar and tells you what she wants to gain a sale. I have been dealing with these none working phones for 4 months. Billing issues for 3 months of over charges, cause the Walmart rep did not set it up correctly, Then phone reps promising that it has been fixed. Three months later still automatic drafts with over charges. So I am out of town and T-Mobile overcharged me and I was not able to get a hotel room for the night ( I was out on business), so my wife and I had to sleep at the grocery store parking lot. I address the concern with T-Mobile and they did not care. My phones from day one had not worked properly since day one. I called and had many promises to repair, call backs and neither had been done. The last rep/supervisor over looked that I said day one and said that I had 30 days to take the phones back but placed it on the authorized dealer when I had been calling in. Everything there after then revolved against the 30 day return policy. Therefore no resolution, tried escalating and he says he is as high as I can escalate other than writing a letter my mail. So how does it take 4 months with no resolution from a company like T-Mobile. We made the move to get away from Straight Talk bad customer service and T-Mobile ended up being the worst! So my recommendation is do not buy from an authorized dealer, they have the bottom end of the products and they do not align to T-Mobile. If there is no stock do not get into the contract as it will mess everything up. Read everything cause T-Mobile does not  care about you once they think they have you locked in. I have asked for escalation or call from corporate and was told nobody will call us back. So it really looks like I am searching another carrier.",0
"Business account with Sprint & then T-Mobile for over 15 years. Staff member lost phone, called to replace & spent an hour with someone who obviously didn't know what they were doing. I had to pay taxes with a credit card ($95), okay fine & staff should get the phone next day or two. Received 2 emails from T-Mobile days later confirming the 2 orders & wrong shipping address on both. Noticed too they charged my card twice for the $95. Called the next day trying to get them to reverse the double charge & cancel the duplicated order. They did not help & ended up getting disconnected. Called back & found out BOTH phones were shipping to my office in another state from where the phone was supposed to go. They ended up having to place an entire new order & this time I paid $48 in taxes??? Well 2 phones showed up at the office this morning & we refused shipment as we were told to...now let's see how long it takes to get the account straightened up. By the way the reason they checked for the returns was ""buyers remose"", I objected & said hope there's a box to check for T-Mobile mess up. Will definitely be looking for another provider.",0
"I transferred devices from one account to another in 2023. Multiple times I contact t mobile because the devices were not transferred. I was told they would take care of it. They never did. They sent me to collections for those devices, even after they verified I contacted them about the issue. I spoke with the store manager and other store employee's with no resolution. I have been trying to get this taken out of collections and off my credit due to their error and they refuse. I have no problem paying off the devices, I just want it off my credit and the payment plan for the devices honored. The only valid reason I can come up with is the fact a family member who worked there was sexually harassed, was physically assaulted, and received multiple death threats from staff at the Yreka, Ca store, so as a punishment to my family for having the manager and other 2 employee's involved terminated for this behavior.",0
"T-mobile deserves zero stars. This is a very expensive service that cannot back up the high prices with not even mediocre service. I consistently had a single bar, the spinning wheel of death, a minimum of 40 minutes wait time and up to 4.5 hours on hold with customer service. The promise to buy your phone is ONLY on paper. You actually get nothing for a trade in. I was also promised $150 in Sam’s club gift cards. I never saw them. I had to pay $700 to purchase my phone so I could get a better carrier for more than 1/2 the cost and far superior service. AVOID TMOBILE!!!!",0
"Have a Business account with T-Mobile and have had excellent payment history for over a year. Nothing financed on my account. Was trading in me and my partners phone for a $1,000 credit per phone. New phones cost $1,200. They still want a $450 Down payment per phone even though that would make it $500 more then the total purchase and they will “ Pay it back “ over 24 months in bill credits. So I’m giving them a $500 interest free loan that they take 2 Years to pay back? Probably taking my business to another carrier. This is ridiculous and makes no mathematical sense. Think 2ce before switching to t-mobile.",0
"I am beyond frustrated with T-Mobile right now. I have been a loyal customer for nearly 22 years. In fact, T-Mobile is the only cell phone provider I have ever been with, and I have sung your praises since I was 16 years old. For the first time, I am so upset over your processes and failed promises, I am ready to take my 5+ lines of service elsewhere. Not only am I considering leaving T-Mobile, but I am prepared to tell every and any one who will listen about my horrendous experience. While that may not mean much to you, word of mouth travels quickly - especially if I go to the media, (which they may or may not care to cover, but I will literally not stop until I'm heard).I have been trying to access my OWN PERSONAL phone records from November of 2022. After much run-around from representatives stating it wasn't possible, I finally spoke with someone from one of your physical locations who not only informed me it is possible, but he also told me how to get them. I wish I could remember his name because I was very grateful for his willingness to help. Per his instructions, I called, ""611,"" and asked for a reprint. Sure enough, that seemed to be all I needed at the time. I was assured I would receive my reprint in the mail within 10 business days.10 business days came and went, and I never received my statement. I called again, and a representative by the name of Angel, was very empathetic. He ordered a 2nd reprint for me, and he even offered to follow up with me within a week to ensure I received them. The week went by, and Angel called as he promised (super grateful for that), but I still hadn't received my reprint. He then told me he would request a manager to upload them and email them to me. He said it might take 24 hrs as they were really busy.I gave them 48 hours to get the job done, and yet nothing happened AGAIN. I called ""611"" that evening, and I reached a different representative who said they would send another request for management to email my records to me. She said she would call me back the following day at 10:00 AM while a manager was present to ensure it happened. Guess who never received a follow up call...That evening, after work, I called into the ""611"" line, and I explained the situation once more. I was assured yet another empty promise that I would have my November 2022 statement in my email within 24 hours. Do I have my phone records yet? No. No, I do not.Never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think that it would be so difficult to request my own personal phone records. DO BETTER, T-Mobile; do better!",0
"I switch to t-mobile 4 phone line and 2 warless internet. the worse customer service they never respond, well yes but only if you a new customer after that no respond I was waiting on hold almost and hour in to different times big mistake to switch to T-mobile",0
"I have had t mobile for over 2 years now because I was stuck in a plan with my sister. Over the last year I've realized how terrible they're service really is. I can't even make calls at my own house without the WIFI. On top of that, every time I try to contact customer service It's super sketchy and I never actually get solutions. I am quitting today because I haven't had service for over a week and I've talked to three different people about the situation all gave me the same resolution. It would work for about an hour and then my service would be blocked again. I have never been as upset at any company as much as I am with T Mobile. All they do is take your money and cause issues. You would have better luck buying minutes than with this company. Absolutely horrible.",0
"After 2 days sim card doesn't work, the customer service is useless, it, a a falraud, don't buy it!",0
"I paid for insurance on my two phone lines. Been with the company 32 years. Cracked my screen, went to the T mobile store on Ann Arbor rd in Plymouth  mi, and was refused any kind of assistance or re -imbursment for my damaged phone. The screen repair was supposed to be covered with a co-pay. They said no, gave me a card for a generic repair place 20 minutes away. 300 dollars later I had a new screen. Don't get suckered into paying for something that they will not honor. Don't get the protection plan. I'm sorry I did.",0
"They would get a 0 if I could. We shut service down for many of the same reasons you see here. We received a bill -$45.00 so the owed me, but instead continued to charge my card. When contacted they said we owed them some $125.00 then sent me to a collection agency when I stopped payment on my card. Now I get another bill -$45.00 yet won't give it back.",0
Their service has gotten really bad lately and I’ve had to keep switching off of their 5G back to LTE back to 5G back to LTE. Turning my phone off and on to regain a cell tower.  My phone loses coverage in areas where it never used to in the metro and suburban areas,0
"If you are a tourist avoid the prepaid t-mobile. The coverage was so poor on the west coast that after a week of use I went back to a store to find out what was wrong. It was the worst wifi prepaid I have experienced in 11 countries. I was told it was unlimited data for US$65 a month, but it seems the prepaid speed is slowed when t-mobile plan users are on the network (they get priority), and it is not unlimited. At 50G you get a message to say you still have unlimited data, but it slows to unusable speeds. Misleading sales and terr",0
"This place has stolen  well over $250.08 from me and has been caught in many lies by me and my bank, as they were called on a 3way call and I have a copy of each transaction  that tmobile usa inc wants to lie about  and completely refuses to fix my account  abd hold the person  accountable.",0
"I was talked into signing the 5G next plan ($180/mo) to get 2 new phones and and several rebates.It turns out $300 of that rebate was no long valid at the time T-Mobile offered me the rebate, and their customer service rep even applied the rebates for me. After 4 months, I check the status of the rebates and they were denied since, again those rebates were dated.T-Mobile is only willing to make up 50% of my loss on rebate.I cannot trust their sales person or the customer service rep that applied the rebates for me. I will be switching services.",0
T-Mobile is terrible customer service is garbage the actual service is not what they say it is I can have 5G 3 bars and it still slow internet customer service is completely unhelpful they don't care about helping you at all go in to the store and its like they don't even know what they are talking about they will lie to you about everything,0
Bad coverage. The last few weeks  I’ve had to alternate between LTE and 5G because their service is overloaded and they can’t provide on the 5G as promised.,0
"Awful company! I haven't used their services for 2 months and they still requested me to pay $200. When I called customer service, I asked multiple times if I would be charged more and was told no. Guess what? I received yet another bill with $24.95 to pay. Called customer service again and they requested PIN (which I paid $20 for and don't have anymore since my account has been cancelled). For not having this pin the charges can't be removed. Online help refused to help me too. Worst mobile company ever. Switching to Mint and will never look back.",0
"They can do whatever they want and get away with it because they have a monopoly on cell towers. That's also why they aren't incentivized to provide quality service to their customer. It's a horrible company and anytime that you have to contact them for any issue, it's like torture. Longest phone calls ever, most inept service ever and everything is ridiculously expensive.",0
"I switched to T Mobile in April, 2024. During the switch, the rep offered me a “free” tablet to accompany the tablet line for my granddaughter. Unfortunately, neither the phones nor the tablet ever had service at my house. After over 2 months of no service at my house, I cancelled and switched back to Verizon. Of course, upon cancellation, the tablet was suddenly no longer free and not returnable. So, I paid the balance and was assured by the rep that it would be unlocked and available to use on any other network. I took him at his word but did not attempt to use the tablet until the end of August. That is when I discovered that it was still locked to T Mobile. I have spoken to MANY different techs and even went back to the original store in an effort to get the thing unlocked. Now, T Mobile is telling me that it is unlocked (it’s not) and refuses to help anymore. I spent several hundred dollars on a device that I couldn’t use (it’s still locked because it was only on their network for several days and was on WI-FI the rest of the time) and still can’t use because I couldn’t use it on their network due to having no service at my house. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM!!",0
I am disappointed in T-Mobile now. They charge $10 to pay a bill AND you have to agree to all the terms & conditions before you can use the app. So I am deleting the app since I don't agree to 3rd parties having my info. I will be switching from T-Mobile elsewhere. They also use 5G that's harmful to our bodies and children's bodies!,0
"Response to request of contact.The team member was very professional and understanding.I apologize for my demeanor.T-Mobile wi fi service is a disgrace !!MORE THAN ONCE MY DEVICES HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET.I HAVE SPENT HOURS ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES.USUALLY ON THE VERGE OF CONTACTING A TECHINICIAN OR REPAIR PERSON.I RECENTLY LOOKED AT THE T-MOBILE TRANSMITTER AND DISCOVERED THAT THE DEVICES WERE NOT ACTIVE ON THE TRANSMITTER.APPARENTLY, THE TRANSMITTER DISCONNECTS DEVICES RANDOMLY.FURTHER, WHEN WATCHING A STREAMING SERVICE THE SIGNAL IS WEAK.AFTER REBOOTING THE SIGNAL GOES TO EXCELLENT FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN RETURNS TO FAIR.THE PROGRAM/SPORTS EVENT IS CONSTANTLY INTERUPTED AS THE SIGNAL ALTERNATES.NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.I WILL START EVALUATING MY INTERNET PROVIDER OPTIONS TODAY. ( 9-12-2024 )FURTHER, MY DECEASED WIFE`S ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED ABRUPYLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF THREE PHONE NUMBERS, CONTACT DATA, ETC.T-MOBILE IS NOT A GOOD SERVICE PROVIDER !!!!",0
Bought a plan for my elderly dad. It never even worked! I tried to cancel but the only way to do it was to travel to the nursing home where my dad was and have a pin sent. Even when calling on the phone! They accept nothing but a pin sent to the phone. They sent me to collections when you can clearly see the phone had never been used. AWFUL customer service,0
"I went with T-Mobile over 20 years ago, back when their signal was crappy at best and everybody had Verizon. I loyally hung in there, now they have grown and have a good signal.  My issue is, after all these years, I CAN NOT get a free phone if my life depended on it. I have tried MANY times, spent hours on the phone with them. I see all these free phone offers for new customers, but not for me. I'd have to change my plan to a much more expensive one AND trade my phones, ( I have 4 lines). Amazingly none of my phones qualify for trade either. (go figure, they're old). I have the plan I can afford and will not change my plan to get free phones. I believe T-Mobiles goal is to get me to switch to a expensive plan so I can get a new phone, they are playing dirty. I am looking at other carriers now, they may be more but they'll give you a new phone, so it evens out. 24 years with them and that's my reward??? Shame on them!Thanks for NOTHING!!Go somewhere else for your service, because once you're their customer they treat you like crap and take you for granted.",0
"A Deeply Disappointing Experience with T-Mobile’s Services.I had specifically requested to block both roaming and international calls on my account due to previous concerns about T-Mobile’s practices. After confirming multiple times with customer support that these services were blocked, I still received charges for roaming. When I called to resolve the issue, I spent an agonizing 47 minutes with a representative who ultimately informed me that the block hadn't been applied correctly to individual accounts. This level of negligence is completely unacceptable.T-Mobile’s support and service have proven to be unreliable and misleading. As a customer, I feel scammed by their inability to deliver on basic requests. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have encountered.",0
"I am an 11 year customer with multiple lines on my account. My wife and daughter upgraded their phones t-mobile sent 2 iPhone Pro phones when we had ordered the iPhone Pro Max. Upon contacting you, you sent a return label and we shipped the unopened boxes back to t-mobile. We were told once the shipped phones are received by the warehouse the new phones will be shipped out. The tracking number shows that you (the warehouse) received the iPhone Pro phones, shortly after we received the iPhone Pro Max phones. My account has still not been updated to show that the phones have been received in the warehouse.I’ve called T-Mobile customer service five times with each representative, claiming that they’re going to see this through and call me back. So far none of the reps or supervisors have resolved this issue. My last call I’ve escalated to second-level management promising to get me video surveillance showing when UPS dropped off the phones, and paper trail in the wearhouse to track what happened with the package and where it is now.. I received an email stating that they can’t help me with this matter and the phones can’t be found, therefore no refund will be issued.I’ve read through multiple threads on the internet, this appears to be an ongoing problem with this multi billion dollar company scamming and taking advantage of their customers. I am currently being charged over $2000.00 for Phones that I sent back to them and are not in my possession.T-Mobile is giving me many conflicting answers, some reps have said the phones have been received and it’s has not been scanned in, some are telling me the boxes were empty although they confirmed the weight of the packages indicate the phones would be in the box, and some reps are telling me that the package is nowhere to be found. We went to UPS and they confirmed delivery has been made. I have filed complaints with FCC, Department of Consumer Affairs and have reached out to multiple media agencies to get this issue on the media. I need resaloution but no one in your company seems to care.",0

"So a representative changed my due date with out my authorization and caused a short bill to be generated for 79 dollars, from this they added it to my normal bill of 200 dollars and are now saying I owe $279.

"My family and I have used T-Mobile for close 10 years and other than the price of the plans, the company wasn't that bad but then again what choice do you have? When my husband and I separated I chose to change phone plans to separate our phone bill. We have been trying to get T-Mobile to unlock the phone for over three weeks now and we still cannot use OUR phones with the new company. Mind you, our phones are completely paid for. I have called multiple times and spent several hours of my time arguing with customer service and nothing has helped resolve the issue. I requested to speak to a manager and they told me that they would say the same thing. It has left me no choice but to leave reviews. Our phones were $1,200 a piece and now they are paperweights. I am so done with phone companies thinking they can screw us over.",0
"If I could give negative 5 stars, I would. They are terrible. Run, run, run!!! I called to order home internet. The guy on the phone convinced me to transfer my cell coverage to T mobile. I decided to transfer my cell coverage. But, I changed my mind after reading reviews. Before I received the SIM cards for my phones, I called to cancel the phones. But...I have been charged month after month for these phones. What a total nightmare! Run, Run Run!!",0
From the beginning I was offered one thing and received nothing.... but a bill.... horrible customer service horrible everything and service isn't that great.....,0

"I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile.  In general, the service has been very good, however, I've encountered two major issues that are unacceptable.First, when I bought an iPhone and Android, I specified that I wanted insurance on both.  When I lost the Android, I contacted T-Mobile and was told that the iPhone was covered but the Android was not.  T-Mobile would not honor the commitment the local store made re. the Android being covered.At the time I purchased the two phones, the salesperson convinced me that I would benefit from having trackers.  I made it clear that I traveled extensively internationally, and would need to track my luggage internationally.  I've taken several trips trying to use the trackers but they did not work.  Today, T-Mobile stated that my trackers would work only domestically, and that only businesses could subscribe to the international service  So, I've been paying monthly charges for these trackers that do not work as advertised.I never encountered this type of misrepresentation from Verizon, and am seriously considering going back to them.",0
We ordered two sync up devices and T-Mobile will not activate the devices without us having to travel to a store and verify who we are.  Spend the extra money and go with Verizon or AT&T.,0
"I have been with tmobile for 12 years and I trusted the internet service, DONT GET IT, IT DOESNT WORK AND AFTER YOU CALL THEM many times trying to find the reason that its not working, changing location of the modem, changing the chip, changing the modem, etc, THEY WILL CHARGE FOR FULL SERVICE. Safe time and get internet somewhere else.",0
So I get a phone call August 28th schedule appointment for September 3rd 2024 6:30 a.m. no phone call no nothing I make an inquiry via text they tell me my application was denied due to location this is a classic corporate negligence they're so desperate the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing and they could care less who they step on. I can tell you this from my experience. If this used car lot treat you like this before you even get to the interview how would you like to have your whole future depending on this scab outfit..... if you're a young technician avoid this place like the plague I'm in his trade 30 years this is a scab outfit,0
"TMobile Home internet service is simply Horrific.  The last time I experienced internet this awful was when internet first became a thing.  The Buffering, Freezing and weak to no signal when it rains MEANS JUST GIVE UP.  There is no savings when you are paying for frustration.  No matter how many times I contacted TMobile to complain about these issues, none of their fixes, or suggestions were a remedy.  I ended up tolerating this bad service for six months, at which point I could adequately afford to change providers.  The worst part is; I cancelled my service on 9/02/24 and was told I would still be billed for the whole month of September because my bill closing date was 25 days away.  Then I was told that I would also be responsible for a final bill in October.  TMobile should have been paying me for all the times I called for support, because the service was randomly available .and at a level where it was useful to all members of the family",0
"About a year ago I went to do a trade in for an iPhone 14 Pro. I traded in my Note 10 plus and got the trade in “promotion” of $850 and the credit would be applied monthly in the bills. They said that all was done and I got the phone. First month and credit didn’t show. So I went to back at the same store and they told me it would “take some time to show up”. OK, I wait another month and paid my bill again with no credit shown. So I went back to the store and they told me that customer service would have to investigate why. They then told me again to wait until customer service contacts them back. This time I waited 2 months and went back to the same store. They said they need more time. At this point I waited a year and I decided to investigate my self. I personally called customer service and they said they would investigate and see why the “credit” didn’t go thru. I then waited another 6 days I was told that the device was “damaged” when it arrived at the warehouse. How can it be “damaged” if in the store it was tested and seen by an associated. I don’t know if they are just trying to cover their tracks and get out of this problem but it was not handled well. I ended up giving up my almost brand new note  10 plus for free and paying full price for the iPhone.",0

"Zero stars if permitted by Trustpilot. I had been with T-Mobile when it was a very good cellular service provider. Since the gotcha notification of the price increase a few months ago, T-Mobile service has plummeted. They are now as bad or worse than AT&T, Comcast, Zoom and the long list of corporations with dismal reputations for customer care. Long hold times to reach a T-Mobile support agent are now standard operating procedure. As I am writing this review I have been on hold for over 1 hour and 24 minutes to reach a tech support agent. This is unacceptable. No one from T-Mobile is attempting to remedy the long hold times. Anyone who selects T-Mobile as their cellular phone service provider should be examined for neurological damage.",0
"I don't usually leave reviews (I will try to post this on other sites as well).Our family totally regrets switching to T-Mobile.It is clear that their mission is wear you down, confuse you, and leave you feeling angry and confused.DO NOT fall for the ""Keep and Switch"" promotion. It is a total scam. The website for the rebate submission doesn't work. The email address they told me to use bounced back ""email full"". The countless hours of phone calls and re-explaining the situation is insane.I feel like a total loser for getting involved with this company.I hope this review helps someone make a better decision than we did.",0
The WORST!!!!!  They lie telling you they will fix any discrepancies on your bill just to turn around and fix it.  They sneak in charges every month and they bolt face steal from their customers!!!  GO ANYWHERE ELSE,0
How are they able to change my phone number and my password to my T-Mobile app without consent. It is beyond me. Then want to charge me to switch it back. I have a terminal illness this was the cherry on top I'm headed to hospital.,0
"I have been a customer for 16 years and am appalled at the lack of response and service I have experienced with T-mobile. I was due to receive a return call on Thursday 8/29 regarding an escalation or investigation on my account. When T Mobile merged with sprint I continued to be charged for a device leased with sprint on 7/21. That lease agreement was for an 18 month period. My account continued to be charged 45 dollars unbeknownst to me for a device that was paid off. In dealing with another issue I saw the charge on my account and spoke to customer care. The total amount of charges post the end of my lease is estimated in the amount of 900$. I was informed T mobile could issue me a three month credit only. I requested that the three month credit be issued immediately. In addition to my request for a full refund credit to be escalated to corporate and investigated. I was reassured I would receive a call back on Thursday from Monique regarding details of that investigation. I never agreed nor signed any agreement whatsoever nor did I receive any notification that I would be billed for a leased device post the 18 month period. No one has returned my call nor was I issued an immediate 3 month credit as promised. I am again asking this matter be escalated. T-mobile makes billions of dollars in revenue from its customers. If this issue is not resolved promptly I will be seeking consultation from an attorney to look into whether or not T mobile is stealing money from its customers and refusing to return calls or refund monies that are owed to its customers. I am asking that my complaint is further escalated and forwarded to the appropriate administration. Not a customer care representative with limited experience, capability, or scope to handle this concern. Please review the last call that was recorded and noted on my account. I am requesting a return call from someone in administration as soon as possible. I am also requesting my account is credited immediately as promised. Thank you.",0
I have been extremely disappointed with this service. I was told I qualified for certain phones. And just to pick them up from the store.  The store said I didn't qualify and I ended up with crappy phones that get hot. Then I get my first bill for 47.00. The second bill went to 470. 00. Then when I could not pay that they added a 200 disconnect fees on it. Despite me calling and making arrangements and being told that I would be fine. Oh did I mention that on my bill there were like 7 lines and services that I never asked for or received. Still didn't take those off or the reconnect fees or the late fees. Then they had it setup on days that I didn't get paid on. Then when I call and try and explain to them why I am unhappy they never resolve anything. I was with atnt for years. My bill was the same 75 a month. With tmobil I get 3 bills a month. And I could continue for ever. Worst service ever. They even charge u for customer service. Wow. Unbelievable.,0
"I was going to leave my current internet and cell phone provider and start both services with T-Mobile. However, when I called my existing provider to cancel they gave me better rates, so I decided to stay with them and called T-Mobile to cancel my intended switch well before the intended switch date, so neither service was ever set up at all. So I thought all is settled. However, I received a letter from a debt collector for unpaid T-Mobile bill.  Up until then I had not even received a bill from T-Mobile – that came later, even after I called T-Mobile to complain and they told me all is good.  I called the again. I was told all is well again “since you never even started the services and we see that.”  Comes another bill. I call them again. The rep says he is going to refer this to their fraud department.  Idk what logic that makes, but that’s supposedly to try to put a stop to this madness. Some days go by and I get a letter from another debt collector. This is where we are today.  This T-Mobile in my judgment is a mad house!!! I will steer away from them like a plague. Now I have to AGAIN spend a lot of time placing more calls… or I might consult an attorney.I call the debt collector. Told them the events above and how I then owe nothing.  He tried to tell me the service begins when I receive SIM cards even if the actual service has not been started. I told him that’s bs. Then I called T-Mobile. Explained all again to the rep. She consulted her supervisors, whoever, and upon returning said there is nothing she can do because it has been submitted to debt collector. The rep was nice and sympathized with my situation. She didn’t think I should be charged for services never rendered. I may have to get an attorney if this nonsense doesn’t stop.",0
"I signed up for the FREE TRIAL via t mobil. I received the equipment and was able to get the price down at my current carrier. I called t mobil and was directed to return the equipment to my local store,which I did. I was directed by the agent in the store to call and cancel to save myself a bill. I called and was reassured I would get no bill amd they would back date the bill to protect me from getting billed. This was on August 15th 2024. Today, August 30 2024,I received a bill for $56!!!! I called again....Another non-e glish speaking chart reader that couldn't and wouldn't help me. Just kept repeating the same thing and trying to ask for the same info!! After 10 min I was so angry and asked for a supervisor. After another 15 mon hold I finally hung up!!! This company is bogus!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM IN ANY WAY!!!",0
"Couldn't even use the data for 3 months. Can't make calls while on the road. Luckily I have wifi at work and home.Asked Tmobile tech for help still couldn't figure it out.He suggested I just upgrade to a free phone.  Ok, sounds good. But Tmobile wouldn't take the phone unless I replace the tiny crack on the screen ($120).Decided to switch to Verizon. Gave me three new phones with much better reliability. I guess Tmobile would rather nickel and dime their existing customers and lose a customer after 7 years. What kind of stupid business model is that?Personel at Verizon stores always look more professional and busy compare to Tmobile stores. Hmmm",0
I've had the worst experience with tmobile. I canceled my internet almost a year ago. They never stopped billing me. I also had a watch I bought. Was supposed to have it's own line. When I went to far from my phone it would say I'm to far for Bluetooth. When I took it to the store they said that It does not have its own line and that the phone number was just to keep track of making payments on the devise it self. Now 2 years later they say it was supposed to have service and over charged me $15 per month. So I totally I was over charged $785. Not to mention when I told them I did not want insurance on any of my phones come to find out they charged me for years 15 dollars a month per line. I refuse to pay the bill they say is $460. They owe me $750. I said I'm willing to cancel what I owe you and get my plan corrected. Keep the extra $350. They said that they can get it so I only owe $270. Thrn said i should have known about it. They will only do $100 credit. I have been telling them for months.  Not happening. I'm done with this company.,0
"Drove to store on Rt 83 in Round Lake Beach ILWent to cancel my brother's phone in my family account w T-Mobile, since he passed away.Employee at Round Lake Beach store said I should do it over phone. I explained I already spoke w someone on phone, and didn't want to do it by phone.He continued to instruct me to do it by phone. Finally i had enough and left. Second time this location can't help me.Drove 20 minutes to another TMobile locationin Antioch and they were able to help me with no questions askedClose down the store in Round Lake Beach. They never seem helpful in any way and this is a national issue with many companies and I'm not accepting it any moreEither perform customer service for the high prices or close.I've been with sprint and t mobile for 20+ years.Very very disgusted.",0
"One star because you can give zero.  Switch to T-Mobile about 6 months ago after about 20 years with Verizon.  I was lied to from the beginning, their support people do not know how a cell phone works, if you want to escalate you have to WRITE to them.  They are a technology company and you have to WRITE to them?!?!? On paper?!?!?",0
"To be the worst ever you must really try. I have over the years had Us Cellular, Verizon, Att. US Cellular was good. In June I wanted to try TMobile  as my present carrier ATT has gone to very poor service at my home due to a tower issue and Att is not going to repair. I had TMobile service for less than 12 hours. My fist issue showed me that their Customer Care is more like Customer We Don’t Care so I cancelled everything the same day as it was set up. I was told I owed zero as I had made zero calls, zero texts, and zero internet. For the 3rd month in a row a bill for $2.67 comes. 1 hour on phone STILL UNRESOLVED. Run away from this company.",0
T-Mobile is terrible. You’re bill will never be the same and will definitely never go lower it’s always some bullcrao and talking to them is like talking to a wall,0
"I don’t understand why there’s no oversight for companies like this.Literally thousands of poor reviews, BBB,this platform,Google etc.all w/same  theme,billing issues,generally poor connectivity & poor customer service &  , God forbid you want out…you’re punished w/continued auto debit or bills.Reputable companies don’t try to make you stay.",0
"Bad service. Calls randomly end on my Galaxy S24 ultra and previously owned phones (Galaxy A54, One Plus Nord N 30). I've called Samsung and T Mobile too many times do the same troubleshooting steps over and over but still didn't fix the issue. It can't be the phone because it has happened on more than one of my devices",0
"I am deeply disappointed with the level of customer service I received from T-Mobile. During my recent interaction, the representatives I spoke with were shockingly unknowledgeable and unprofessional. I called with a relatively simple issue, but instead of providing clear answers, the rep seemed confused and had no idea how to address my concerns.When I asked for clarification, I was met with vague responses and several "" i cant do that."" It became clear that this representative lacked even basic knowledge about the services and products T-Mobile offers. To make matters worse, their attitude was indifferent and dismissive, making me feel like my issue wasn’t important to them at all.After spending over 45 minutes on the phone without a resolution, I was left frustrated and no closer to solving my problem. It’s shocking that a company as large as T-Mobile would allow such untrained and unprofessional representatives to interact with customers. This experience has seriously made me reconsider continuing with their service.T-Mobile, if you want to keep your customers, you need to invest in better training and hire people who actually care about providing help. This experience was unacceptable.",0
"A tmobile store ""gave"" me a ""free"" phone when I renewed a contract.  The tmobile store illegally signed me up for a new line, which is why  the phone was free.  When I cancelled the illegally added line, I had to pay $500 for the phone.  Now the phone can not even be unlocked even though it is paid for and my account is in good standing (for 14 years).  Time to make a FTC complaint and get a new carrier. I have spent over 10 hours talking to support and supervisor's in at least 10 different calls, the latest (and last) being today.  They are truly incompetent.",0
"Used my TMobile iphone on a densely populated street in a U.S. city called Chicago. A metropolitan area of 8,984,000. At 6:29 pm CDT on 8/26/2024, received the following text from TMobile customer service:""We hope that you are enjoying your plan benefits! Your usage has been roaming off our network, which violates our terms and conditions. If this line ( ) continues to roam extensively over the next month, your line will be canceled.""Called TMobile customer service to ensure it wasn't spam. It wasn't. I was advised to get a Tmobile coverage map to avoid this heinous error in the future. Yes, I am to memorize the Tmobile coverage map at all times, street-by-street, in the center of the 3rd largest city in the USA. Assumed that, because TMobile has 77 stores in a city of this size,this carrier would have full coverage. Bad customer that I am, I was wrong. I learned that I need to memorize the TMobile coverage map in Chicago. And most everywhere that I use the phone. I have learned the hard way, after 18 months of timely payments totaling $1566, I learned what an awful customer I am. One more incident like this and TMobile will terminate my line. I only wish I could attach a copy of the above text from TMobile to share with the world. If TMobile wonders the identity of the evil customer who posted this review, then I suggest that they check texts they sent at 6:29 pm CDT on Monday, August 26, 2024. Oh, and I then learnt that the ""roaming zone"" in question was within TMobile's prime 5G area.",0
"I was with T-mobile for very long time. Even when they whitelisted my phone for being too old. When I got tired of spending money on a phone that only allowed me to use it like an old dial phone, I decided to switch to another carrier. Here's a tip, don't tell them you are switching until you have switched, otherwise they will turn off your phone, where you got all of your access codes to your T-mobile account, apple account, work accounts, etc., and then they will cancel your account before you can get your correct account number, which by the way cannot be found in your account. After nearly 10 years with them they rewarded me with aggravation and contempt. Let the phone subscriber beware!! T-Mobile sucks!!!",0
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR T MOBILE!  Bait and Switch.  The hours and hours on horrible customer service to get no where.  Promised service at $35 per line.  Credit for trade in.  Now $55 per line, they have my phone and nothing I can do.  Will not honor $35 even with recorded call stating $35.STAY FAR AWAY!",0
Why customers got to pay extra 5 dollars to make. Payment in store when store is empty and nothing going on and the coverage sucks half time. Makes no sense,0
The t-mobile agents are not honest they told me that the internet is 50 dollars a month but when i received it and activated the device it was 60 dollars a month and the phone services when i switched to t-mobile was awful i canceled it the same day i got it and they didnt refund me the full money i paid for they only refunded 16 dollars of the amount 43 dollars i paid for .. they were terrible in every way i will never choose t-mobile again.,0
"I left T-Mobile May 31st this year for a cheaper option. Two weeks later they billed me for the upcoming month. I called 9 time since then and still have not received a refund for their billing error. Suffice it to say, I will NEVER return to T-Mobile!",0
"The wors experience ever for a prepaid sim card. 1 They do not accept European credit cards (they just do not accept them, why? Idk). 2. Once your number got deactivated you are no longer in a position to pay for another month... In order to reactivate it, you need to log in into your T-mobile account, but it requires... receiving a text. Once the number is deactivated, you cannot receive any texts.Worst experience ever. DON'T NOT GET T-MOBILE!!!",0
"Everything was going fine with t mobile until you suggested.Changing my account to save money.  Once they did this, They broke my account into parts that I didn't even know they were billing.  Now they are asking me to pay back charges that we're in a account I wasn't even billed for.  DO NOT USE TMOBILE!",0
A representative told me to oay $150 and my services turned only to be told that I needed an extra $230. It's so low to lie to a customer to get them off the phone.,0
I would not recommend them to anyone worst company and obviously liars who are selling defective Iphone 15 to customers and refuse to send a replacement when the problem with the phones are not caused by the customers. My phone is not even a year and I have called them 6 times regarding the situation and they refused to replace because I do not have insurance. Why should I when the problem us with the product you sold. I cannot wait to get another company to buy out my remaining contract from them. They have gone down hill money and greed is what's driving them now. They no longer value their customers. Do not switch to them.,0
"T-Mobile bad news don’t buy - I phone 15 - from T- Mobile store there no good you will get a problem with the camera and- t mobile will do nothing and Apple wants to charge you $1,200.00 to fix camera rip off t mobile is bad news my phone is new yet and have insurance on phone and to replace my phone they want a lot...",0
The majority of the customer care specialists have no clue what they are doing.  They read a script.   I had to call multiple times this week trying to resolve and issue with a phone and it was HORRIBLE. I wasted hours on the phone - one rep was very helpful but the info she gave was incorrect - and led to more calls and trips to the store - then I escalated to a supervisor - only to find out after 90 minutes on the phone with him - the info he gave me wasn't accurate because he is in a different time zone - my question was - how do I know that?  Shouldn't he know that?   So they told me they were trying just to set the expectations - it ended with my reply of - no your not setting the expectations - you are telling me that once again T-Mobile is failing and not fulfilling their obligations for the 2nd time this week.   I've been with Sprint/T-mobile for 21 years and am seriously considering a change.,0
"I was a loyal customer for 18 years---18 YEARS. When I moved to my new apartment 2 months ago I could not get any reception for my phone or home internet. I contacted T-Mobile numerous times and was told since there was a hospital between me and the tower, that I would not be able to get reception. So I reluctantly had to leave T-Mobile. Then their tune changed. I kept getting billed for things, claiming I didn't return some type of hardware I supposedly got in 2015. I would call and get a different story from the representative each time The last straw was them sending me a collection notice for a bill that they had never sent me for that supposed hardware. The actual T-Mobile bill didn't show up for 4 days after the collection notice which is just wrong. I should have left T-Mobile years ago.",0
I have been a customer of Tmobile since they took over Sprint and about 10 years with Sprint.  My bill went up $20 and they told me it was because I paid my phones off.  So had I kept paying for phones it would have been less expensive. I was then told they would give me a credit for being a loyal customer for so many years and I asked if that was permanent.  They told me they would check.  I called today and the lady I spoke with was rude and condescending and said you arent going to get credit for something you arent paying for.  I told her cancel my service and hung up.  She called back and I said I have nothing left to say to you she said i cant cancel your service if you hang up.  I said well you were extremely rude have someone else call me because I dont want to talk to you. no one has called back yet.,0
"Complete junk. I will have a voicemail show up and my phone didn’t even ring. And then if it does ring, it takes forever for the voicemail to show until it transcribes it to text because T-Mobile thinks thats needed.  All of a sudden weird things happen on my phone like my navigation apps don’t know where I am. Their cellular service is junk. I have better cellular service with them with 2G coverage when I’m overseas than I do with them in the United States. I also don’t have enough reception for my apps to stay on. I click on an app and it turns off immediately.",0
My family has had T-mobile for six years and the past couple of months have really made me regret choosing them as my cell phone provider. My son’s phone was not letting him make or receive calls or text with the data service only with Wi-Fi. My husband has been to a T-mobile store and has talked to several T-mobile representatives on the phone to rectify this issue. Long story short… the phone is still not fixed but we still get a full bill every month for four phones and can only use three. If that’s not stealing I don’t know what is. Your job is to provide customers with service and satisfaction we have received neither for two months. As a parent it is vital for me to be able to contact and communicate with my child through our cell phones. This company has stressed my entire family out behind this one issue that an entire company can’t seem to resolve. I will wholeheartedly be in the market for a new and more trustworthy cell phone carrier immediately.,0
"Absolutely the worst wireless company in the country!Aside from dropped calls almost daily and messages not going through the customer service is atrocious.I have never dealt with such stupidity and ignorance and I was with Bank of America...that's saying something!They will literally lock your phone even after you've paid your bill forcing to pay again.The lies and games are truly unbelievable.It's no wonder out of every single carrier in the country they were rated the absolute worst...on a scale of 1-100 they scored a 51.I'm not surprised but so grateful to be gone and to never have to deal with their terrible ""lack of customer service"" agents ever again!",0
"I give T mobile zero stars you're on hold for over three hours. I've proof on my phone. After 55 minutes was hung up on. I don't know what happened to tmobile.  The manager, Leo   very rude disrespectful to woman, he belittle me the entire call. I don't know why Tmobile is hiring unprofessional people that arejust outrageous and customer service representative are unprofessional not helpful at  all very incompetent when it comes to resolving issues. I'm going to find another provider.  I , dont recommend Tmobile poor service and they steal your money and charge you for services you don't have check your bill.Tmobile should be ashamed of themselves. ::;((((((((( Leo manager should be terminated immediately check phone conversation. It made me cry how rude a man can be to a female customer:::(((((((((",0
"Where to get started? Buckle up for the complete crap show that is t-mobile kids bc its a doozy.To start.. i have a samsung galaxy s22Ultra i wanted to keep my phone when i changed servies to t mobile. The man at the store told me i had to BUY a phone from them in order to get the sim card for tmobile. My daughter also got a phone. We were told her phone was only 30 and mine was 7 and that was it we just had to pay the start up. WELL LET ME TELL YOU thats where the lies began. I was NOT informed id be paying MONTHLY on the phones. Two phones one that I didnt even NEED bc i had my own phone. Their customer service told me i didnt need to buy a phone for the sim card.. but dude in store said i did.They told me my bill would be 80 a month for 2 lines of UNLIMITED 5G NEVER SLOWS DOWN SERVICE.... my bill is about 98 a month and more often than not random charges get put on my bill.""My speeds will never slow down no matter how much data I use"" bold face lie. My data slows down and i have to CALL customer service for them to reset it. They told me to call every month to have it done if it slows down. Why should I have to?!?! I was blatantly lied to by this crook of a company on so many aspects of this entire situation.The service is trash. My phone takes forever to load things even on their ""5G"" and half the time my phone goes to 4GLTE WHICH IS SLOWER THAN WHAT I PAY FOR!! I have to use my wifi at home lately bc service is so slow things wont load its ridiculous.  Do not waste your money on this company. Shady business!",0
"This is a PSA for any T-mobile users out there. Watch yourself, cause T-mobile is out here stealing peoples money. I was with them for 2 long years. First, it started off with them telling me they could lower my bill, the price they quoted me was not the price I saw when I got my bills every month, service was ok but definitely not as good as my previous carrier. I knew almost immediately that when the contract was up, I was out! This past November it came time and I jumped to another carrier. They ported numbers over and told me to check with T-mobile to be sure that all lines shut down. December 19th I did just that, mind you it took me 3 hours in store to close because of some pin they said I set up in the initial start that 2 years later, I had never used. I spoke at that time to both in store associates and customer care and both assured me that I would only pay the balance they requested that day to complete the close of all lines. Neither would provide this so called “pin” even with my ID. I thought that would be the end, but a friend mentioned to me that they had something similar happen and their account never closed, causing another bill. Something told me with all the trouble I had with them to check on it. On Jan 29, I went in store to confirm that I was all set. Some how I had a bill larger than a normal monthly bill, I spent about an hour in there arguing with them before agreeing to pay another $288. They credited my account for an additional amount since they had seen that it was an error on their part. I verified several times that this was the last and final bill. Customer care and associates, again say that is correct and I reluctantly pay and leave.Mind you, once you port your numbers T-Mobile shuts down all access to your account and you cannot see or track any bills or payments. Well, it is now August… I receive a $175 bill from T-Mobile, but this time it comes from a bill collector! What?!? I go back in the store, they pull up all notes and agree that this bill should never have happened, call customer service and discuss my account. They have no explanation, but tell me it’s my problem, because it’s gone to collections. I will have to dispute the charge. They cannot help, customer care did not speak to me directly. I’m not gonna lye, I blew up in the store. To be clear, I NEVER received any bills. The store says they have an old address, but the debt collectors sure knew where to send it. I went home and called customer care myself.These people wouldn’t even talk to me about my account, because I don’t know the “pin” to my account. I have always used the same pins for everything, if I had a pin I know exactly what numbers it would be first of all, but no one in the company could or would talk to me about this account. Saying that they can see my account without the pin and don’t know where the charges came from??? Refusing to take care of or help in anyway! Again they told me I had to go to dispute with the debt collector and hung up in my face, when I told them that I am not dumb and know they can see all things related to my account. I called the debt collector to try to dispute it, and they told me that T-Mobile has to zero the debt out, in order to dispute and if I don’t pay it, I will see the hit to my credit. I AM PISSED AND WANT EVERYONE WHO DEALS WITH T-MOBILE TO BE AWARE….IF YOU READ THEIR REVIEWS THIS IS HAPPENING OVER AND OVER TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE. IF YOU GOOGLE IT ALSO SHOWS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST T-MOBILE FOR WHAT APPEARS TO ALSO BE FRAUDULANT PRACTICES. PLEASE MOVE ACCORDINGLY IF YOU USE THEM FOR YOUR CARRIER. As for me, next step is either the news or a lawyer!Sorry for the long rant, I would hate for y’all to have to deal with this non-sense!",0
Purchased an upgrade on my phone through their online rep. The phone I wanted they did not have in the local store so I asked if they could ship it to the store and I pick it up there. I was told this would not be an issue so we completed the purchase and I paid taxes and activation fees. Received text and UPS tracking notification that the phone had arrived at the store and was ready for pickup. I get to the store location and was told they don’t have the phone but they can see the transaction on my account. My only option is to wait in limbo while they “do an investigation.” In the mean time the money I paid can’t be refunded and I can’t upgrade my phone or do anything until they complete their investigation. No one can tell me how long it will take or what their process involves. There is no one higher up I can speak with and nothing else they can do. I was told by the store sales person they usually don’t allow shipping to stores because this has happened before. If this is an issue why would it be an option at all. They know I don’t have the phone but someone signed for it at the store or a nearby business. Store claims the person who signed is not an employee there. I get the need to investigate but why hold me in limbo for who knows how long when they clearly know I don’t have the phone. Do better T-mobile!!,0
"Very bad experience,always sometimes wrong.Internet connection is very bad.Customer service is like unreachable. Thinking about to leave TMobile after many years beeing a customer",0
This is a failure as company! T Mobile should be ashame to call there self a company.  They charge you for everything but you can't use any of it down to your insurance. The customerservice is a joke. They love to say they will call you back personally when they want you off the phone. Total failure to it's customer's,0
Their stupid voicemail transcription they think is such a benefit is annoying. It makes it take longer for the voicemail to show up. Sometimes I have to turn my phone on and off for it to show up.  when you do changes like this make them optional. Sometimes people don't want it.,0
After 14 years as a customer and requesting an extension of 3 days until payday they shut off my service. I cannot call my doctor for medication or anything. This is ridiculous and petty on their part. I will be taking my phone to a competitor and switching service. My family and friends will also be switching as when you mess with one person sometimes it has a bigger ripple than you expected.,0
Run don't walk away from them service suks.  Tech guy messed up my phone and voicemails and the supervisor john via chat REFUSED to call me or have someone call me and I have black and white proof of this,0
We canceled service and Tmobile continued to debit account. We called customer service continued to get runaround and no resolve to situation. We where a 20 year customer and over years watched bill go up service go down switched to Xfinty,0
Ridiculous if you are able to get a hold of somebody they'll will keep you waiting for 35+ minutes. After countless texts and phone calls no reply. I bet if I wanted to sign up for a new phone somebody would be available f****** joke!,0
"Service is the best I've found, where i live.(BUT)! Why is it everytime they download something to my phone for an update it screws my phone up?!?!?!?!?!Right after DL some of my APPS don't work, I then have to REPLACE the App! I send a text message now and some kind of advertisement come up in the (D--)!!! TEXT!!! I would ask that no more DL' be sent to my phone, but then they would have some kind excuses as to why they do it, like it's a benefit to ME/AND I'M SURE THEY KNOW, WE KNOW ITS  (D--) LIE!!!Well if our Government does it then is OK, BUT NOT WITH ME!I don't desire a text, or an email telling me how sorry you are for my troubles because, I CANT STAND BEING LIED TO!!!",0
Terrible experience the CSR show no empathy and are rude,0
"-5 They owe us stars! I was lied to by a sales person. She asked if I wanted a watch. I said no. A little while into the ""new phone upgrade"" she asked again. Again I said NO. 3 more times she asked. I said I don't wear watches I will never again wear a watch and I certainly will never wear a computer on my body. She said, ""Well it comes with the phone as a gift. It's free"" I said no. She said people are using it as an insurance policy. I don't have to wear it but I can use it to locate my phone if I misplace it. She got me with logic and appealing my sense of security. SCAM ARTIST!  But it was free right?? Wrong!! She added a line $35 a month and $15 a month for the watch!! She never went over my bill even though I asked if my monthly charge was going to be the same - $83 a month. She said yes the same. THEN after a time of owning the phone I downloaded my pictures and PHOTOS OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW WERE ON MY PHONE!!!  IT IS A USED PHONE!! The store won't help, they won't connect me to the district manager, they don't believe when I say it's a used phone with glicthes and OTHER PEOPLE""S PICTURES. No one is getting back to me. And now THEY'RE COMPLAINING THAT I AM CALLING CUSTOMER CARE!!!!! Last response: ""Well I can't guarantee that anyone is going to help you. They may or may not call back."" YOU CAN'T GUARENTEE THAT ANYONE IS GOING TO DO THEIR JOB??? AND YOU'RE OK WITH SALES PEOPLE LYING??? STAY AWAY! IT IS A GERMAN OWNED COMPANY - LOOK IT UP.",0
"I am 9 months pregnant. Less than two weeks from delivering. My husband and I needed to use this paycheck to get the last few baby items we needed before the baby arrives so even though we do not usually we decided to split our payment as T-Mobile allows. I wanted to pay half and the other half in two weeks. But T-Mobile only allowed for first payment in two weeks and the second in a month. Silly I thought, so I made the first payment (unknowingly doing so in an amount that was 1 cent off) through the app and intending to call T-Mobile later to cancel one of the auto pays. As I have done in the past. The customer service rep I got when I did call today, two weeks later was not only not helpful and rude but just kept telling me over and over again how this was my fault and she can't do anything. I made a fuss and she kept putting me on hold but resolved that if I made the minimum payment of $1.50 that would take care of the first payment and they could cancel the auto pay. This I was fine with and was so frustrated and crying I just wanted off the phone at this point. With the issue resolved we got off the phone and I took a much needed nap. The customer service rep continues calling and texting while I'm sleeping and I finally answer for her to tell me oh hey that didn't work and it will be charging you tomorrow, with zero recommendations and basically just telling me I'm screwed. T-Mobile is a freaking joke and I'll do nothing but tell everyone how awful your company is and I will be taking my business elsewhere as soon as possible. Great customer service not trying to solve anything and doing nothing but blaming the customer!",0
"Terrible experience with T-Mobile's customers' service.Paid the phone on May 1st, T-Mobile sent the wrong phone, returned the equipment,  has to pay again to get the correct phone.  The refund never came back after 3 months with numerous phone calls,  talking to over 20 different agents, every time they gave wrong story,  still fighting for the refund..",0
This is about the internet box that's supposed to be the best.(oakhillsCalifornia 92344)..it's not for 8 months I called about once every week to get it working and was replaced 4 times and about 19 techs but the service was never there heard every excuse...they said I will get a full refund but nothing,0
If I could give negative 5 I would. Their customer service is awful and what they tell you in the store is different than what they tell you over the phone or from one person to another. No consistency in processes and no idea how to be helpful at all.,0
Straight garbage. I got sos in my room. My ROOM. And the paying system is goofy,0
"I wrote a review about the awful service I received at a Tmobile store. I gave them a 1 star rating. A ""supposed "" owner replied to the review with his email address. So I decided to take him up on his offer to discuss my review. Turns out that the email address was phony and probably the name of the owner as well! Tmobile is very helpful when you are signing up for a service. But when it's necessary to cancel the service, they aren't so helpful anymore! I had signed up for the 5g internet service to use at our campground park model. It didn't work very well and I took the modem device back to the Tmobile store I got it from to cancel the service. All of a sudden, I'm not allowed to return the device and they are not allowed to cancel the service either. I was told I had to call a number to cancel, they would email me a return label, then I had to box it up and take it to UPS within 14 days to return it. RIDICULOUS!!",0
"T-Mobile is trash! If I could give them zero stars I would. Customer service is horrendous, rude and they over promise and do not deliver. They are not for the customer, they over charge us. I have had several times when my service was interrupted unnecessarily and added restore fees and they wouldn’t remove the fees but restored service and none of this was no fault of mine and all they could say is I apologize, this company is so un professional it’s ridiculous. I am very displeased and plan on leaving after years. I highly DO NOT recommend",0
When we set up our lines and bought our smart watches they accidentally charged us for an extra watch line. We unfortunately didn’t catch it and when we did they only refunded us 8 months out of 24 months. The person we spoke with would not transfer us to a manager and said that the manager said we would have to just eat the cost. He would not come to the phone. I find this ridiculous. 21 years with Sprint and we never had issues with service before. They get bought out by T Mobile and it’s been nothing but problems. Their home internet service is terrible.,0
"If I could give them a (-5 star) I would. I dread being with this company and is seriously going to change companies as soon as I get a chance to. The way this economy is setup its already difficult for one person to manage paying their necessities like rent/mortgage, utilities etc, it makes no sense having to pay a phone bill that’s almost equal to the same amount as the electrical bill. This company rates are ridiculous and have no problem shutting you off. Knowing everyone needs a way to communicate, uses this to their advantage to rip people off.",0
"I am deeply disappointed with the service provided by T-Mobile. We agreed to a two-week free trial on June 21, 2024, after two of their representatives visited our office. They set up the service on June 27, but it was not functional. They came back on July 1 to fix it, but within 20 minutes of their departure, our systems crashed due to issues with the T-Mobile network, causing us to lose access to our patient database.Despite multiple attempts to get help from T-Mobile, we were met with unresponsive support. I had to manually troubleshoot the issue and revert to our original internet service. We wanted to cancel the trial, but were told we needed to visit a T-Mobile store. Due to the 4th of July weekend, we couldn’t get there until July 8, which was still within the trial period from the second setup.Now, we are being billed for the service despite the numerous issues we encountered. Every attempt to resolve this by phone has resulted in being put on hold or transferred to incorrect departments. This level of customer service is unacceptable and has caused significant disruption to our operations.I would not recommend T-Mobile based on this experience. The lack of effective support and resolution to our problem has been extremely frustrating.",0
"July 5, 2024 I was going to switch to Verizon. I had such poor service with them that I cancelled the request to port my number over and use their service. That's when my trouble ramped up with T Mobile. Ever since attempting to switch he can receive texts messages from me but I can't get text messages from my spouse. We can call each other. . He called his carrier and they said they show that I have no service.  I get text messages from others and received them from others with no issue. I talked to the T Mobile tech people who couldn't resolve the issue. They said they would call me back. They never did. This was mid July. I logged into my account and they have also now completely messed up my billing. They said I am passed due and I have not been passed due with them ever. All I did was change my payment method. I talked to someone else today 7/28/2024 and they said they would fix my bill but it still looks messed up to me as it still looks like I am passed due. If you don't charge my payment method how can you say I am passed due? They are also billing me money beyond my usual monthly payments and I don't know what for and it could not be explained to me. I have been with T Mobile for over 20 years and the whole reason I tried to switch in the first place is because I didn't want to wait in line for a phone for three hours. I want my bill corrected, I want my current payment method to be used to pay my bill, and I want my phone fixed. I would also like a free new phone after 20 years and all of this aggravation I deserve it.",0
"T-Mobile is the worst service, I literally got a phone call because I left a penny off of my payment.  I woke up to my phone being cut off.  The customer service is horrible and they can never seem to help with anything.  I am seeking another phone carrier.  TMobile is a scam.",0
"I switched to T-Mobile (July 2024), and what a mistake.  I was sold on several promotions to include free Hulu.  I was told by the sales person that I could add to my Hulu subscription (after activation), additional subscriptions such as Disney and ESPN+, only later to find out that I can't add any additional subscriptions without giving up my free Hulu.  During the switch over to T-Mobile, one of the phones could not make cellular calls.  In speaking with Technical support they told me the phone had to be taken to a T-Mobile store.  We did, and they were able to get the phone working, but we were also told the fix could have been done over the phone with Technical support.  Further, my first bill did not include any of the discounts associated with my service plan.  Buyer beware.  If I had it to do over again I would never had made the switch to T-Mobile.",0
"T-mobile does false advertising. They had a promotional offer for their home internet, that if you add a t-mobile home internet, you’d receive a 50 inch 4k Amazon TV, valued at $450. I added t-mobile home internet, applied for the promotion, and was approved to receive the promotional offer, however, t-mobile did not send me the tv. After over 23 hours of phone conversations with different departments of t-mobile’s customer service, the t-mobile agent only offered a $260 credit toward my account. I refused the $260 and asked for the tv that I was offered or the $450 value. And t-mobile refused my request. This is false advertising and t-mobile should know better and not treat their customers this way. They should honor what they promised, either the tv or the value of the promotion.",0
"I was a T-Mobile customer for about three months for my business.  When I signed up, I was promised rebates for bringing my own device and for switching from a competitor.  Understandably, there was a 90 day wait for those rebates.  However, the rep also promised me a $100 credit per month for four months to cover a Comcast Mobile termination fee.  I had this in writing from the T-Mobile sales rep.  I had to call each month for over one hour each time and talk to various reps to get the credit.  It was a fight every month.  In addition, I live in Delaware near the beach and the reception was horrible.  Dropped calls frequently (including when I was calling T-Mobile customer service).  Yes, the service reps are very nice but the bottom line was the never did what they said they were going to do and the overall network service in both Maryland and Delaware was marginal at best (on all the lines I had).  When I finally dropped T-Mobile I was four days into the next billing cycle.  They charge for the for the full month and do not pro rate.  It was a very bad experience dealing with the network quality and literally hours on the phone with them trying to settle billing issues.",0
Worst customer service of any company ever with the exception of PayPal ! I don't get my text from the Braves or PayPal every other text I get. I miss the first five innings of the Braves game because you have to have a smartphone to get in the gate they don't have paper tickets anymore. And this T-Mobile phone couldn't get text from the Braves for some idiotic reason. So T-Mobile ruined my birthday I'm canceling my service with them and those incompetent morons will never get another cent from me ! And they almost got me evicted when I couldn't get a text code to confirm my identity for 3 months now. Stay away from T-Mobile and PayPal or you could get a nervous breakdown like me. Cried and yelled at them for hours now the last three days and this is the third time their incompetence has caused me great misery ! Phug T-Mobile 💩,0
When I tell you this has been the worst experience and I've been with them for 8 years!  Their reps need to be brought back yo the US and retrained!  I have taken over my mom's plan years ago were speaking 8 years ago... On yhe phone told them etc.  I'm not even going to explain the crazy they took me through today but the rep keeps telling me they need to speak with my 87 year old Mom that has demitia! I told them I have POA days ago... But he keeps asking to speak with her...  Whyyyyy! I offered to send it over !  Ridiculous!,0
"Do NOT use T mobile.   We were a Sprint customer for over 20 years.  They switched to T mobile and everything changed especially the customer service.  We were given a third line for free.  When we switched companies, they wouldn’t let us take the line number with us for the third line so we canceled the number.   They charged us almost $300 to cancel the free line.  I fought it but they said it was a valid charge.  How???   We weren’t under a contract and the line was free.  Absolutely garbage.  Everyone I talked to was clueless and rude.",0
Was told my credit card would be refunded. When I called back I was told the refund was denied. After I expressed my anger the agent spoke to her supervisor and I was told I would receive an email the next day stating I would be receiving a refund. I never received an email or a refund as of today. I am still chasing the refund for the principal of it.,0
"I went to the T-Mobile store on Power and McKellips in Mesa, AZ. My son and I went in to buy new iPhones. We were told that we could get 2 iPhone 14’s for free since we had 4 lines. That wasn’t what we wanted.. but they convinced us to get them. Then when my phone was finishing setting up and the glass was already on.. another employee told us that we had been overcharged for the glass accessory. Last night I was watching TV, and a T-Mobile commercial came on. They said that the deal was 2 iPhone 15’s for free with 4 lines. I was furious!! I had been lied to and cheated. I never had these issues with Sprint. This will make me not trust people who sell me things. I am furious and will tell everyone who will listen. T-Mobile stinks!!",0
"T-Mobile customer care, suck big time, the peoples don't know what their ate doing, don't care what problem you are having don't have the knowledge to resolves your problem Everytime I call get the same thing my call gets disconnected today it happen to me 2 times, I was left again with no",0
"Worst company ever. I made a new deal with them with agreement,  once I changed from my previous company to them , they changed everything.  Don't trust them.",0
"For several months, my bill has been incorrect.  Each biilling cycle I must go into the store and have it corrected,  The store manager calls the company offices and says they fixed it.  Just got another incorrect bill. Maybe they should let me move in since I am there so often  Follow up to above - upper management says the store was wrong, and my bill is $26 more per month than what I was quoted! I am filing a complaint with the FCC and the Minnesota State Attorney Generals office.",0
"Hey good afternoon !I have been with so much trouble with T-Mobile since when I upgrade my account.I have Been waiting since march 13 with some promotion was promised, but I never get that.So I was switching my plan and I requested many times to my new plan should covered so I can switch my phone with the promotion for $800 and have internet out the countryI ask the lady about magent plan because I had before and I had both of this request ed working well - the internet and the switch with 830 credit.So I switched my plan and she said I can get the phone switched with her on the call but will take 5 business day to get the new one, how I work with my phone and I don’t want wait she said I can do on the store, when I got on the store they said this promotion doesn’t exist.I called again on the same day and they told me my plan is not covered and this promotion doesn’t exist for my plan.Recap:  in the morning the lady switched my plan she said was covered and I have 2 different promotions 1) with the 800 because I’m upgraded my line and the other was 2) the 830 because I’m on magent planSo until that date I have been fighting because I can’t get this promotion the lady told me on the phoneThe other time,  I spoke with some representative they put a new line to fix my problem and got worse because he never did what he said, he told me he just will put a new line until a get the promotion and after he will cancel. He just disappear and I start pay for two different plans - magenta plans and go 5g plan. I never agreed with that. I told him, he can put if cost the $10 dollars like he told me and if he cancel after.The other time, other representative told me he will put a credit monthly because all the mess the other representative was making on my bill, on the first month (I think was may) he put a credit, but after he just disappear and no credit anymore. I supposed to just to start pay something just in July, because of the promotion I got, but they put a line on my bills and now everything is a messThe other representative she just told T-Mobile can’t do anything. So I was tired and said ok to them cancel the new line (I never requested) so I lost the promotion because was attached to the new line. I started pay for the phone in full, but I never got my phone I send before back, because I just send my phone because I was doing a trade with $830 credit.Just remembered that wasn’t the deal since the beginning, because the deal was I upgrade my line and get the credit for $830 credit and switch my phone.July 13th I tried again, I spoke with the supervisor Anthonyalison he told me he will open a investigation and call back in 3 days, one week pass and nothing he never call me back. When I spoke to him, he told my bill was $161, I was very angry about this price for 1 line, and he said he saw wrong and this amount wasn’t my bills. After I finished the chat with I check my app and my bill was $161, for 2 lines I never requested and I have already cancelled.On Monday July 15th was my last try to fix this mess, I call again and make sure I’m speaking with someone representative based in Florida, because I went also to the store, but just the representative could fix this mess because they did that, and the representative on the store said for I call Monday to Friday and speak with someone from here, they know better what they are doing them other representatives from other countries. I did that, call on Monday speak with Jen, she told sorry many times and she said she will fix my problem, after explain to her all the problem she ask to speak with her supervisor and she will fix. She ask me to call me back on Friday -July 19th at 9am because she needs check with other departments and she told they have to fix because they give wrong information. Of course one more time, on more person didn’t call me back or said anything or fix my problem.since march I have been paying my bills wrong and much higher than I should. I have been speaking with more than 8 representatives/ supervisors to fix this problem, and nobody care. I’m exhausted. Every month my bills come with a different amount. I just want what exactly was promised to me and done and I can’t keep call or text every month.",0
All I’m going to state is STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY .Do not waste your money or time on this company that’s the most transparent warning ⚠️ I can provide. DO NOT PURCHASE T-Mobile service. Save yourself now.,0
"Their service socks. I'm a prior customer of Sprint and since they took over the service has went down. I have had to call them every day this week about me not being able to have a conversation with people cause my lines keep breaking u or they can't hear me at all. Still nothing is being done. Sending a new phone, but it's not the phone, it's in their towers. Told me at first they were working on the towers, then they had completed the work, but it's still happening. I tried a phone with AT&T service and it works perfect. Been with them over 20 years. Bout time to find another provider.",0
"I joined T-mobile when it was the ""uncarrier"" under Jonh Legere.  The service wasn't always great, but they tried, and I wanted to support that.  We were on a family plan, and after about 15 years, and as the kids aged, it made sense for us to switch to a different carrier that better fit our needs.  That's when the nightmare started.I got an letter saying that I never returned a 4G range extender that I received in 2012.  Yes, 4G and 2012.  It had never worked for us, so we returned it to the store at least 7 years ago.   There was no indication on our account that T-Mobile still thought we had it, so I had long since lost any receipt -- it was off the account, so why hold it?So I called T-mobile at least 10 times over 7 months.  First they said they were trying to locate it, then said I'd receive a credit since they found it.  The credit hadn't been issued, so I called again, at which time they said that since they had no record of it, I owed the full original price, plus a late fee, and there was no way to appeal.  Remember: this was a 4G (which is seldom used) device that was over 12 years old and they told me that they would issue a credit ... until today.  Oh, and if I didn't pay, they'd ding my credit rating.So today I paid over $200 to be done forever with T-mobile.  I hope other people have better experiences, and I loved ""old""  T-mobile, but I couldn't recommend T-mobile of today.  To say for months that I was all set, then to turn on a dime -- for a device with no value that they should have known I returned -- is (IMO) terrible service, so to anyone who asks, I'd recommend trying another carrier.",0
"I had a frustrating experience with T-Mobile earlier this year. The service representative provided a lot of misinformation and didn't represent the T-Mobile brand well at all. I was misled about qualifying for the $300 gift card, which I never received. Additionally, I was billed $6.26 for an invalid charge, which was the main reason I decided to switch my service back to Spectrum. When I called customer service to resolve the bill, the representative claimed he needed manager approval but didn't offer any real assistance. Overall, my experience was disappointing, and I hope T-Mobile improves its customer service.",0
"Ever since I've had T-Mobile, it's been a joak. Today was icing on the 28th of June for the month of July end. Store then on the 18th I wake up to my phone and my internet being turned off saying that I needed to pay $45.06. I had to pay that cause I needed the phone.  And when I paid it they're telling me they're gonna charge me in additional Twenty dollars per line that got disconnected I would not recommended them to my worst enemy there always fees every month it is a new fee and won't happen again I am going to pay my phones off and change my services if You're thinking about switching to t mobile DON'T DO IT learn from my mistake",0
"Recently switched my service from Verizon to T-Mobile. I called & got prices on phones / plans, etc. I asked specific questions & made very notes on what I was told. 3 phones were supposed to be $0 per month after credit (get an Iphone on us!) Asked several times, so..what is the monthly credit on each bill? $34.59 each month for 3 dif lines for a total due of $0; one other line was supposed to be credited at $16.67 per month for a total due of $17.92. Basically a total of $17.92 due for 4 lines. When the bill comes due, its actually $47.51 for 4 lines of equipment. Im told no one can fix it. I have made numerous calls, talked to a 'supervisor' and 'Ass. Coach' and still told no one can fix it. Now they have my trade-in phones that were all good and paid for.",0
"This company's software will flag your account. Lock your card, keep you from accessing your money and they won't do anything about it. They'll refresh your card and you have to wait 24 hours to access your money. This place is c*** I would not recommend it to anybody.",0
"We signed up and paid the tax on the phones and router.  Bryan Johnson said he's the main boss of the business unit out of Nashville Tennessee and promised us he would personally handle our getting activated.  He failed to ever answer us back.Then after 5 days we recieved a month's bill for $206.00.  Keep in mind we still don't have internet or use of our new phones and still recieved a bill anyway.After complaining to countless other so called specialists we were told we still have to pay our month's bill even know we sent back all phones and router and never received service.What a bunch of Losers, especially Bryan Johnson!!!",0
I bought a phone directly from Samsung that was unlocked. You could choose a carrier you wanted so I went with T-Mobile. The phone cost $1104. I decided to change carriers. The phone and the T-Mobile account are completely paid for. The phone however is locked to T-Mobile and they don't know how to unlock it. I am stuck with an $1100 phone that is useless. Samsung says it's T-Mobile. T-Mobile says it's Samsung. Who is responsible?,0
"Incompetent helpBeginning Feb 12th I reported that my line was not receiving one time passwords (OTP) and could they add code or whatever was missing.  They never fixed it (I would have gone to another carrier but they had the best signal in the neighborhood. This OTP issue was reported to them about 20 times with their same nonsense and they put in a service ticket and nothing was wrong on their end, even went to T-M store who checked with service and no one can help.  On May 14 I chatted with Felicia who had the problem fixed since T-M set up the line incorrectly- I told them that on Feb 12th!I am updating due to the Sept 2024 experience. I received an email from them (T-M) saying my service was suspended for non-payment.  No line or messages were working- Since I was auto-pay, I checked my credit card and saw that I did pay T-M.  Called and the automated system immediately said did I want to pay and restore service. Assuming that the ""extra""  payment would be in my account and I could restore service quickly, I paid again.  Still no service.  Finally spoke to someone who could see that I paid twice.  Took them 24 hours to restore the line.  Messages were still blocked by T-M for 7 days!!! until they fully restored service.  They gave me a credit but I would have preferred to have service.  These issues should not be a surprise to the CEO if he is doing his job!",0
"My boyfriend had just switched to T Mobile while he was cleaning up flood damage in MN and had destroyed his previous phone in the water. We were told we could drive to a store to pay his bill as he  did not want to be late. There were a total of 5 people working at this location. We were aware that a couple of them were training, however no one in the store really had a solid idea on how to handle a simple transaction. They had originally told us that we could make the payment no problem, then were informed that they would not accept a check so we said okay, we can pay cash. Then we were told they could do an e check but that also turned out to be impossible somehow. When it was decided that we would just pay cash, the employee informed us that it would be an extra $5.00 charge to pay in store! That is horrible customer service. We made sure to drive to a location to pay the bill to your company so it would not be late and we are going to be punished for that? For a new customer, or any customer for that matter, it does not show much confidence in the company.",0
"I signed up for a deal that they take automatically from my checking account. Not the credit card but checking account. That should have been the red flag for me. But I went ahead with this. The deal was that I pay for their service and for the phone. At the end of 24 months period the phone was supposed to be unlocked and mine. The service was bad, the technical support was unhelpful, their customer service rude and useless. Of course, no surprise that I wanted to leave at the end of this 24 month period. It was a full time job to get my account number and a transfer code from them Finally I got that and move on to another carrier. But they locked my phone and it's been several days I am trying them to get it unlock and they blame Samsung, Florida, heat anything in the world but not unlocking the phone . They have no legal right to keep it but they know that take them to court is a hassle so they steal. This company has nothing to offer. They are just thieves!",0
"I recently had a highly troubling experience with T-Mobile that left me deeply dissatisfied. Somehow, someone managed to gain access to my account. It started with a call from a person impersonating a T-Mobile employee from the loyalty department. They knew all my personal details, including how long I've been with T-Mobile, how many lines I have, my exact monthly bill, and more. They promised me a discount on my bills and even deposited money into my T-Mobile account to appear legitimate.The impersonator offered me two free iPhone 15 1TB devices, but instead, I received iPhone 15s with only 500MB. They tracked the delivery and knew exactly when the phones would arrive. After realizing the mistake, they called to apologize and provided a return address to send the phones back. Everything happened so quickly that it felt like a whirlwind.When I reported the incident to T-Mobile, I expected them to take swift action to resolve the issue. Instead, they informed me that since the phones were delivered to my house and someone in my home signed for them, they are not responsible. Despite my detailed report, T-Mobile refuses to take accountability, leaving me to bear the cost of the phones.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and has shaken my trust in T-Mobile's security measures. Their lack of support in resolving this matter is deeply disappointing, and I am now stuck with a significant financial burden due to their inadequate handling of the situation.",0
"T-Mobile is like  scam. When I sign up with them at Costco, they Promise me with all that rebate and promotion And the plans I need to sign up. After I sign up and send in all my rebate three months later, they say I don’t qualify with my current plans So they tell me to upgrade my plan in order to qualify and switch back to my original plan after. but now when I asked them to switch me back to the original plan, they say the price going up so do not believe anything they told you in the promotion because they will find a way to make you pay them back in two years like me I’m stuck with them for two years 😢",0
"Whatever experience you have with Tmobile it will only get worse when you try to cancel service!Even if you own your own phone, they will keep charging your bankcard… then when you call to get them to stop they turn on the nasty full blast. Forgot or never knew your pin code? Well now you have to go into a store and they will photograph your drivers license just to get a pin code so you can talk to people in the Philippines who hate your guts!! Why do they hate you? Because they have to work for peanuts talking to you. Doesn’t matter that they caused your problem or they make mistakes that cost you hours of time and thousands of dollars… no they have the power to put you on hold, the power to disconnect the call so you can burn more time. They have the power to steal your money and if you complain they will steal even more. Once a decent company they now operate like Time Share con artists. They must have promoted the worst from Sprint after they bought that heap.After hours of being abused and being forced to go to a Tmobile store to prove who I am just so I can talk to an fill in the blank, to beg them to stop stealing my money as I had no account with them for 4 months… I get one who promises to immediately refund me for the unauthorized theft. Note that they never sent me a bill for these months of charges. I used no service and had no device of theirs! So she promises to refund me. Instead she makes the mistake of double charging me for all months of service that were supposed to be credited!! How fill in the blank can a person get? So I make the mistake of calling yet again (5 hrs now!!) and finally get someone who claims to be a supervisor. Wants to blame the whole thing on me! Tell me how to talk and not so loudly!!! Yes she too promised to remove the charges and the double charges and also errs and triple charges me!! Totally insane. The company has turned into a scam. Full on scam! God help the folks who are employed to rip us off and have no other way to make a living. You might also ask why after 15 years would I ditch Tmobile and go to Visible? Tmobile started charging me an extra $10 per month, because they billed my credit card not my bank directly. No way was I going to give these fill in the blank my bank account no!!! I had always used a credit card and was charged in advance each month. Nowhere in my agreement did it say they could charge $10 for using a credit card. They claim that banks started charging them higher fees!!! Liars!! Banks are not charging them more than 1.75% For my bill that would have been about $1.20 and banks were charging that all along. Some greedy fill in the blank at Tmobile thought it would be a good idea to steal another $9 from senior citizens. I began raising disputes on the $10 charge and calling out the breach of contract. They kept up the charges so I found a better deal at Visible. Now Tmobile is worse than Sprint was. Its become the telecom sewer. Tmobile cons and steals then hire impoverished uneducated people with attitudes in a 3rd world country to terrorize you. This is the criminal state of Telecom today. Yes I filed complaints with the FCC, my attorney general, and bank. I will sue if necessary!!!",0

"I have been a T-Mobile customer for many many years. I was recently offered an upgrade by 2 different sales people. 3 lines for $165 and free iphones. Received my phones and the first bill. I'm being charges monthly for each phone. After many phone calls to customer service i'm being told that they would never offer a free phone. Then they promised to provide a 30$ monthly credit for phone charge, but that was a lie too. That will never happen. All i hear is that i'm sorry. We made a mistake. Don't ever buy T-mobile service. They steal your money",0
Very dishonest company they do not do what they say overcharging our bill.wish I would have stayed with AT&T will switch when I can get out of contract,0
I have made atleast 5 long calls. In desperation stopped at different stores at least 5 times and no help getting my visual voice mail. The people on the help line just repeat same stuff everytime that does not work. On 2nd call right now for today supposedly getting manager ...still on hold.. if this call sucks like the rest then I'm going across street to at &t..okay call just hung up. I'm done .,0
"Terrible customer service, but what would you expect from a dishonest company. Every month when I look at my bill, I have to spend an hour or more on the phone with Tmobile trying to get some sneaky additional fees removed. After wasting time trying to upsell me to new services, they inevitably admit that the charges were added in error, but next month it happens again. I think they just keep trying, believing that eventually they can pass one by me without my noticing. These fees range from $50 to over $100 per month. Agents are polite but feel free to lie as necessary to make the customer happy. Just because you call in and get your complaint ""resolved"" does not mean that you are not going to have to call in again when you find that your bill is still incorrect and they have charged your card. Then be prepared to waste more time with agents who assume you are in the wrong and fail to grasp the problem. An additional trick they use is to charge you the erroneous fees but say that they will reduce your next month's bill by the amount in question. However on the next bill, they will have made the adjustment but added some other false fees and random deductions to create lots of confusion which is far beyond any of their support team's capability of understanding. I suppose they are banking on customers just giving up. Frustrating!",0
"I have been with tmobile over 6 years, never miss a bill etc. After years of trying to get me to upgrade to more expensive plan without success, all of a sudden my bill is increased.

"I cannot express my disgust with the new t mobile adequately, but will try. I was a customer several years ago, and T Mo had great regional CS who answered within a few every time. For personal reasons ( left the country) I disconnected, then returned when back in the states. MY GOD. the new cs system is the worst WITH any corporation I know of. Since buying a phone (trade-in, but they have lied repeatedly that they never received it) I have had to contact CS 6 times, each time literally an hour wait for a sweet Phillipina, who promises solutions, which rarely appear. Not their fault, I'm not doing some racist stuff here, just TERRIBLE CORPORATE DIRECTION results. I Am now trying to unlock the paid for phone I bought from them 2 months ago, and none of the site stuff works, 2 CS agents ( 2 hours wait) are unable to unlock, now advised to wait 48 hours and call back. What a lesson in enshitification of a previously good company. Stay away!",0
I had them for about 3 years and my mom lost her phone. I called to see if they were offering any promotions on the phones. They said we I was eligible for free upgrade. We sent 4 phones to get 4 new phones. They can’t find 2 and they put me in as a promotion to by when get one free with the additional line. So instead of paying for the tax I’m now paying for 6 lines of services and 2 new phones. So my bill went from paying 127 a month I am now payin 222 per month. Every time I call 1-3 times per month. The same thing happens every time. A supervisor tells me they are going to escalate it and get back to me and no one ever does. Stay away from them!,0
Unbelievable ! Wanted to switch from Verizon to t mobile. T mobile wanted to check my credit score !!! Have never seen this!! How can I allow you to check and hurt my credit score to get phone line or just to switch !!? You get a new customer and I have to pay for it by hurting my credit!! Unbelievable. I would never recommend t mobile to anyone,0
Worst there is! They don't help unless it's taking your money! Be careful they steal your hard earned money!!! 🤬,0
"I switched from Verizon to T-mobile, they offered a $200 gift card for the mobile phone switch and a $50 card for going with their home internet. A year later still don't have either. Provided them the rebate codes THEY provided me, said the $200 card will ship soon, a month later, nothing. The home internet works well, the phone coverage and service isn't as good as Verizon. Customer service is the same.",0
"They are so desperate to take there long time customers and lose them then have a respectable business.  Pay my bill every month through my bank on 13th and last month June 2024 the charged me a late fee $7, but not any other months has it been late. T-Mobile tatic to make you pay on their website or set up where these fraud folks can automatically debit your account. They make mistakes and then how would they rectify correctly in a timely manner, they won't b/c they don't give a crap!!",0
I can have 5g internet both mobile and in home wifi with perfect connection and somehow unable to get anything done cause its always loading and even received calls and missed them the voicemail comes thru a day late i cannot express enough that tmobile is just garbage,0
Business account terror line of credit stolen after going online to purchase devices for my new business account was asked to provide ID and business info and was approved for $5000 for business credit and when I was asked to pay the sales tax swiped my card for $358 the store Rep had to call customer service and verify my bank account over the phone with BOA business. Once completed the rep on the phone stated he would complete the transaction and send a digital receipt to my email. He told the store rep to wait a few mins. for it to go active when she logged back in it showed I only had a $1500 business credit and he closed the first account and created a new one now the devices I was already approved for I can no longer get because my credit limit has decreased and after 3 weeks of talking to any and everyone no one seems to be able to get my business credit back on top of that 20 days later I received a bill for 6 phone lines with no devices and 3 different account open in my business name so a total of 9 lines no devices but I’m being billed customer service sucks and they will hang up when you try to get to the bottom of things.,0
"I recently wrote a review of Assurant, the company that does T-Mobile's insurance company. It wasn't a good one. I didn't really have any problem with T-Mobile, I had been with them for 2 yrs. After getting bent over by Assurant I reached out to T-Mobile thinking maybe they could help me. Their response was to inform me that I got bent over deal with it. Well I decided I would just buy another galaxy out of my own pocket but it just rubbed me wrong. So fighter pilots I'm now a straight talk wireless customer. T-Mobile has no appreciation for a good customer and they are as sorry as Assurant. Like peas in the same rotten pod",0
"Tmobile has gone down hill. They rip you off, service isn't good, add on fees , etc. All the negative reviews are true! This company was good back in 2014, but Now No!!!",0
"I have been with T-Mobile for 15 years. Originally, I was delighted with them. I recommended all of the people I knew to them. However, well before covid, their prices increased and their service decreased. Where before, an issue could be resolved with a call to customer service within minutes, the last dozen calls I have made have required multiple calls that take anywhere from 30 - 90 minutes to get a human being. Most recently, I received a $300 charge for a piece of supplemental equipment I had used since they did not have coverage in the location of my rural home and workplace, which I returned when I moved to the city. That return was not documented, and now, six years later, I am being informed of the misfile  technology that I returned.",0
I am suicidal because of this company.  This company has taken everything from me.. my job. I'm about to be homeless in a month. I can't return a 800$ bike. I've lost 20 pounds because I can only afford to eat once a day. The reason is because I dropped my phone in the water. Had insurance got a new phone. They don't have a store around here (wish I would have been informed) in fact it's a different state. They can't send an activation code to my phone because the sim isn't activated makes no sense. I can't go out of state to get a frighten code because I am disabled. They are going back and forth back and forth. Telling me they guarantee it's fixed to telling me there's no way around it. It's making things that much worse with my mental health when they do this to me. The reason I cannot access all my accounts is because I changed every account to just one password. I forgot to write them down and was going to  but then i dropped my phone in water. worked as a 3rd party Amazon seller (job lost) apartment (I'll be homeless in a month) rapid weightloss (lost 20 pounds in the past month because I can no longer afford to eat) I cannot access my home security system (which is awesome because there's been an influx of break ins where I live) I don't know what I'm gonna do so I can only see one way out. This company has taken everything from me. I've never been suicidal in my life and now I have it all planned out. I'm making arrangements to give all my stuff away and just let my family know just how much I love them. I never thought getting a phone would be the reason I leave this world. I've never experienced worse customer service in my life. They really could care less about the customer and only care about money.,0
Tmobile is a fraud. There a serial rip off to the public and they need to be shut down for taking advantage of customers and price gouging there contracts and basically popular for ripping people off and up selling there products in ways that leave consumers in debt. They also are extremely disrespectful when your bill is due and they literally will lie on the automated line saying there customer service is closed when my prepaid bill lapsed but any other time they were open when my bill was active lmfao. This is a seriously evil and screwed up cut throat company and i can't wait until tmobile dies.,0
They lied about the plan they promised and then had the gall to steal my trade in. Every time you call in its the same 1hr conversation explaining the problem all over as if no one has written a single note of previous conversations. They promised a new S24 and payoff my trade in. Got the new S24 and they are not honoring the trade as they said time ran out! But its THEM screwing the order up twice not me!! I said send me my phone back then..reply...NO! I have never been so livid nor had such horrible service from a company. Most untrained unprofessional staff EVER!! I am going elswhere as soon as my new $400 S24 is unlocked. What a joke!,0
"The T-Mobile store in Hermitage on Lebanon Rd are liars and thievesThey tried to change me 3x the restocking fee snd force me to spend more money in an upgradeThey lied about the features on an Apple Watch which brought about the returnI had to call customer service to get anything doneThe assistant mgr Marcus leads the way with lies and misinformationThis store has a lot of complaints and I hope goes out of business, either way deal with them at your own risk",0
"My wife had a Galaxy Fold 4 with a malfunctioning screen. The phone has never been damaged, but despite this, they refused a warranty exchange saying she was responsible. The screen going wonky is a known problem but they law it on the consumer saying they damaged it. Stay away from T-Mobile . . . don't walk away, RUN. I will never do business with T-Mobile ever again.",0
All I need is access to my online account.  THEY CANT DO IT.  They have had multiple people make really stupid attempts at fixing the issue but.....THEY CANT DO IT and this is a commercial account.Pathetic,0
T Mobile will extract as much money as possible from you. The company is not trusted or truthful in any sense. They promised me a great deal on a phone if I sent mine in any condition. After they received it they said the screen was cracked and will charge me an additional $26 a month for 24 months. They lied!,0
I had T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for several months before the defective router kept disconnecting and rebooting. I canceled the service and returned the router. Customer service never mentioned anything more was due. 14 days later I was charged the usual month internet fee of $50 and customer service said I had to pay for the complete billing cycle. They wouldn't even give a credit for the unused internet. I considered this a form of theft!,0
Stole $1000 dollars from my account on auto pay. They admit they made a mistake but keep telling me to call Ass-u-ran Insurance. Tmobile took the money from my account.,0
"In April 2022, while in Georgia for work, I went to a T-Mobile store to inquire about a wifi hotspot. The representative there told me about a small wifi device they had. I asked if I would be able to try out the device and T-Mobile’s service to see if it would actually work where I was and if it didn’t work, return it. He said yes.I signed up and took the device home. After trying the device and service out for 5 days, I was not able to access the internet using it. So, I returned to the store where the same representative helped me. After returning the device, he told me I would not be charged anything else and my service was canceled.For a year following that day, T-Mobile charged me $50 every month. I called them several times to request that they stop withdrawing from my account and refund the money they had taken. They told me that I had to go into a store to be helped with this.So, I went into a store. At the store, they tried to help me by calling T-Mobile’s Care department. At that point, they said that T-Mobile Care would be taking care of it - that I would not be charged anymore and I would receive a refund. That did not happen.I followed up with the store manager after yet another payment was taken out of my account. By this time it was March 2023, almost 1 year after the first charge! I never received a response from her.So, in late March of 2023, I went to my bank and asked that they place a stop payment on T-Mobile’s monthly draft from my account. They did that and refunded a portion of the money that T-Mobile wrongfully took from my account.T-Mobile has now (as of 6/17/24) reported me to a collection agency stating that I owe them $378! I do not owe T-mobile any money and in fact, they still owe me over $300!I wish I would have thought to place the stop payment with my bank after the first fraudulent charge by T-Mobile. Regardless, beware of T-Mobile.",0
"Worst customer service. I have called about the same technical issue multiple times, at least twice a month for the last 6 months, and spent at least 3 hours every time I called ... No technical knowledge what so ever, no professionalism, and a total waste of time and money ...",0
"Have been a customer with t-mobile since they started. They were recently bought over. Now my reception  has a lot of areas that don't come in where it did before. My data was unlimited to a point and would then slow down,in the 15 years I've been with boost this only occurred a couple of times. Now it's every month. And with the new owners it doesn't slow down,it stops!!!!! NO DATA AT ALL. This is a breach in my original contract stating a slow down, not a complete stop, meaning you can't get any data use on the road.You were always able to see how much data you had left before the slow down would acura. Now you can't check what you have left and it just stops working. This is the perfect situation for a class action law suit. Anybody on board,count meIn, it's not about the money,it's about being a loyal customer and a new company taking over and now trying to get more money out of you to increase their profits. Verizon may charge more, but the service is the best!!!",0
"If it was possible to give this company NO STARS that’s what they would earn. No stars. They lie to their customers. They use deceptive and discriminatory practices in everyday business. If I could switch carriers I would. It’s not because of the service. It’s because of the customer service, management, and C Level Executives that continue to let this crap go on. They only care about how much money you can give them. They don’t care about their customers. Hence their 1.3 stars rating.  Their trash. Simply put.",0
T-Mobile ripped me off. The best way to get a real response from T-Mobile for a complaint for getting ripped off is to email the CEO then  the most important thing is put in a complaint to the FCC. T-Mobile executive team must reach out to you try to resolve and then respond to the FCC within thirty days. The links for both is:  put a .com at the end of his email Mike.Sievert@T-Mobile   He is the CEO. Read this about what you file a complaint about. Then go to the FCC site and file a complaint.  Hope this helps.,0
"T-Mobile should not be trusted. While I was excited to transfer from Verizon to T-Mobile because of all the benefits and credits that I would receive, it seems that they lie and will bait you to switch and state you do not qualify for the promotions they explicitly state you will receive. I have never had a phone carrier to lie just to get you to switch from another carrier. Should have just stayed with Verizon or considered AT&T. I was told that I would receive a port-in credit which at the time that I was told, the promotion was already expired but this is what the representative sold me on in order to switch carriers, in addition the T-Mobile Representative sent me the required forms to submit to receive the credit, even offered tips on how to submit them successfully. While the promotion was being processed I called multiple times for status updates and the representative assured me that I would receive the credit, just give it time to process. Later, that promotion was denied due to it being out of the promotion period. Yes, this is an error on that T-Mobile representative's part, which the T-Mobile Care Team acknowledged, however, they do nothing to honor this.",0
Had T-Mobile Internet. Was unable to get unlimited even though on waiting list 4 times. When notified by app notification that it was tried to sign up but was declined. Found service with no data cap and returned router. First tried to charge me for damage but router was never moved in my possession. Then charged me for normal wear when they specifically say there is no extra charge for equipment. With data caps and them going back on their promises I cannot recommend their service at all. Stay away if you have any other options,0
"Long story-read if you don't want this to happen to you. When issues go on endlessly for years – it's not just a once or twice fluke nor can tower location always be to blame. So tired of hearing, “it's the towers” “it's the tower location”. Then fix tower problem or stop selling in this area.I know some people say it works so good. Some win the lottery too. Doesn't mean it's a common occurrence! Looking at tmobile rating here seems the chance of it being “so good” is same as hitting lottery jackpot. Millions to one! I truly don't know where tmobile gets those best of stats. NO ONE I mention tmobile to has anything good to say about them.Unfortunately we got it all – internet, 2 phones & watches. Tmobile internet & cell service is unreliable. No matter if home, out locally or some other city we could not count on having reliable cell service. We had 2 identical phones & side by side could have different connectivity issues. 1 working, other might not. Might work one trip, not the next. Not always same phone or in same location – just whenever either couldn't connect. Phones also would say no internet connection available when it should be cell not WiFi anyway. Later in same location it would work. Cant find directions or businesses without connection. At times no cell service at all, was garbled or dropped calls.With so many problems & internet outages I took photos & videos. Basically anytime you turned on a device requiring tmobile you knew it would probably lose connection at least once or something else. An hour show might go out 5 or 6 times, every day & at all times of the day. My photo file got so large I had to stop. Local office still looked at me as if I had 2 heads even after viewing videos of what I was telling them. Didn't care.Being so unreliable, I would not give a child a tmobile phone. I'd also discourage travelers especially those who go alone or need to rely on cell service.For travel safety & being locked into a contract, we got a prepaid account from competitor to compare with tmobile. Competitor passed consistently with flying colors, every time & everywhere! Like we knew, it was just tmobile failure. And it's not like we're in some remote part of the world or well below sea level etc. We live in town, not country. We couldn't wait to dump tmobile! We also tested internet – competitor works. They offer free internet booster if it doesn't work throughout house! Price is only a bit more, but we now have an internet system that works. Watching an hour program doesn't take 2 hours now.  Cheaper isn't better if it doesn't reliably work.When phones paid off & the ""no contracts"" contract part of bill paid off - we canceled all services May 11, 2024. Was paid up to date at that time as of recent auto-pay. Only charges from then to May 11 were now due. Said final bill will be sent. DON'T cancel before you stop auto-pay & remove payment method. It's how they overbill you. Make copies of anything important on your online account. You cannot access your online account once it's canceled. You'll be told changes have to be made online, then told if number canceled, there's no online account now. No one will help. This allows them to create charges & bill since most people don't double check for accuracy.Not being able to remove payment method, through BBB contact from tmobile Sr. Specialist Team, CEO. She took auto-pay off & most importantly reviewed account to give what was actually owed. Said made notes on account but was confident final bill would now be correct amount. Told us wait & contact her if amount was different.Arrived 6/5/24 amt almost doubled. Contacted. She got back to us with true amount owed & how to pay now there is no online account access on about 6/6. We paid this amount due within a few days. After all today is only 6/12/24. Wasn't paid today or yesterday.Tmobile is horrible!! Recap - Account current. Last auto pay 4/21 next would've been 5/21 – but canceled tmobile 5/11. Received final bill abt 6/5 still wrong amount due – contacted home office immediately & paid within days of actual amount due. Today – 6/12, just a month from our cancellation date - I receive a letter from collection agency dated 6/5 on behalf of tmobile for a crazy amount & fee on top of it for service on a paid up to date account that WE cancelled. Date of their letter shows tmobile had to contact them well before 6/5 for agency to create/mail me letter dated 6/5! Really? I am furious!!I work hard on my credit rating (another stupid thing for only businesses to legally way overcharge consumer since it's damned if you pay your bills off & damned if you don't) to have a company like this so blatantly abuse the system!!For mobile/internet service that is reliable & works - forget tmobile exists! - Just remember t-mobile service (for me) stands for Terrible Mobile Service! Go elsewher",0
"This place is terrible I made a settlement to pay my T Mobile home Internet now when I call they hang the phone on my phace I make settlement and I pay now they say I have to pay more 130,00 ?? I am taking you all to court I am so tired of this company bulshit",0
"T-Mobile customer service is a total fiasco! I moved away from T-Mobile when the company I work for introduced us to Previ. Previ still uses T-Mobile service but at a much discounted rate for corporations. During the transition I overpaid my final bill which was reflected in the last two statements. I tried the online chat feature of which they asked for my PIN to access my account. Of course they  said I had the wrong PIN# which is the PIN I had been using for years, and years as a T- mobile customer. I was told I would need to call the customer service line to get this resolved. After 30 minutes on hold I spoke to the rep and they told me I was out of luck if I didn't have the PIN. I was told I would need to drive to a T-mobile store and reset the PIN with picture ID, which I did. I then returned home and called customer service back with my new PIN in hopes of finally getting my overpayment back. Well it wasn't that easy, I was told to give the PIN and she said it was the wrong PIN.... LOL you cant make this up! She then told me I needed to call a different number which I repeated back to her because I had never heard of a number starting with 999! She assured me it was right but to call it tomorrow due to the long hold times. Well my intuition was right and she sent me to a non-existent number. I once again called the customer service line at which I spent another 20-30 minutes on hold, explained what had happened and my frustration with it taking me three days to get this resolved and still no help! So in total I was about 4 hours and having to drive to a store to reset a PIN that they said was wrong to get a 95.00 credit! This not the first time that I have experienced this with Tmobile. Shame on me for that but there will not be a third time! If the credit is not in my account in ten days I will camp on the store doorstep and have a conversation with every customer that is considering t-mobile!",0
"T-mobile billing department has been annoying, dishonest, incompetent and harassing us!",0
The Worst !!! I don't have coverage at my house I don't have coverage at work !!! I pay $93 a month for one line I paid extra for insurance and when my phone broke and I filed a claim to get a new one they sent me some off brand that's all messed up and customer service is a joke and no help for anything .,0
"Was told I would have great service in my area. Called the next day of getting the service bc we had no service, they told me a tower was down. We r in month 3 and guess what they still say tower is messed up. Can’t wait for my 2 years is up. I am out and will never use this service again.",0
"MediaRelations@tmobilecommike.sievert@tmobilecom -EMAILS THAT DONT WORK !! SCAM Trying to get help n no one is respondingSecond this that happened:Good Evening ,I would like to address fraudulent activities going on with Assurant claim department they posted a bill of 582$ on my account for a phone that was returned to the warehouse on January 8th . I have attached the Tarcking number and Date of delivery  and Person that signed for it .Now of April 6th they cahrge us the 582$ for a phone that was deliveredT-Mobile  now cut off our phones claiming we haven't  paid the bill but i paid 300$ for our bill but assurant decided they can post  a bill on our account and take the 300$ to cover a charge  for a phone that was returned  to them n signed for .This is absurd  i need a resolution  in atleast 48 hours i can't  pay for a phone thats not working and Assurant should stop stealing from people's  accountsToday April 10th Tmobile said we had to add another 176$ for them not to cut our lines off and also Assurant Jorge Morales Supervisor who was so rude and unprofessional  was called to ask about the  credit that was supposed  to post 10days after i called beginning  of last week  but now our service  was going to be disconnected again by T-Mobile because of Assurant ignorance and fraudulent  activity.I had recorded calls from Assurant and T mobile automatically .I dont understand  why Jorge ( The same guy that received the phone at the warehouse) and his team are also lying to customers  about the timeline that issue are supposed to be resolved  contrary to what T- Mobile says that it will take 2 billing cycles for the credit to post or and the charge to be taken out of the account .Assurant  needs stop  being dishonest and rude and fraudulent at this point , and this looks bad on T-Mobile brand coz i this will also be advised to other T-Mobile customers online via social  media.This is ridiculous  and unacceptable  since now our account reflects  718$ that we dont owe !Still today June 6th this issue is still not resolved  and we still getting charged  300+ over our regular bill !!!",0
"OMG....T Mobile sucks!!!!! WTAF is going.  I am actually still on hold as I write this awesome review!!! 1 Hours 5 Minutes!!!

"T-Mobile will always be the worst company to deal with.  They can’t even get plans right.  They f’d my family plan and now I’m paying 30% more.  I was originally was with them for 18 years and left them because they were so bad.  I came back because a friend mine worked for them and told me they have changed.  Nah, same ole same shyster.  After I come back from business trip, I’m switching back to Verizon.  Little more expensive but their customer service is second to none.  They don’t screw up or mislead you to think that it’s free or at discount.  Scumbags!  I have filed a FCC complaint with their billing practices.  I doubt anything will happen but I'm done with this poop bag company",0
Okay good luck with T-Mobile but the only problem is they took the payment out automatically on the wrong date said they were going to send a gift card to me and never have done that it took four times to try to correct an address because they never did corrected in the computer now they refuse the gift card I've got no credit back on my bill and I haven't got a gift card from them or a refund for their mistake I don't know what else to do I guess legal action is the only way that I can get it back plus a lot more money for pain and suffering and distress I would rather not go that direction but they seem like they could care less,0
"Their scam detection program is a joke. Literally, it labels every incoming call as a potential scam call  if the person uses their phone occasionally.",0
"This company are abysmal. Don't use them. I have spoken to them on the phone 4 times and each time I've been promised a 10 pounds refund due to an unused top up as the network would not work on my phone. This has taken place over a period of 3 to 4 months and is utterly ridiculous. Disgraceful. Obviously the don't value and have zero respect for customers, just fobbing them off.",0
T-MOBILE WAS THE WORSE COMPANY 20 YEARS AGO AND NOW EVEN WORSE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND THE SERVICE SUCKS. FINALLY I GOT RID OF T MOBILE MAFIA AFTER SUFFERING FOR 2 YEARS AS THEY WONT LET ME OUT OF CONTRACT. TODAY I  ASKED THE LYING AGENT TO REMOVE AUTO PAY SHE LIED SHE DID BUT SHE NEVER DID SHE HUNG UP AND CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THE DUE DATE YOU CAN TELL HOW FKED UP THIS COMPANY IS VERY DECEPTIVE AND NOW I AM ON HOLD FOR 3 HOURS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY LIED AND CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE TO T-MOBILE EVEN METRO PCS IS A BETTER COMPANY THAN THIS MULTI MILLIONS DOLLAR COMPANY LIKE T-MOBILE WHERE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE AND THERE SERVICE DOES NOT WORK AT THE AIRPORT METRO PCS DOES.,0
"I had service with t-mobile. Decided to go to another company. Notified them in plenty to make the switch before next billing, After speaking to reps and supervisor they concluded I owed small amount okay paid it notice in memo pd in full via Supervisor. Today I get a bill they want $10.01 more. To my understanding.They cashed the check with message pd in full.So why are they asking for more, very shoddy underhanded tactic.I would not recommend  them in any way because of this issue.",0
So I got behind on my bill. Paid 288 less than 2 weeks ago. Was going to pay 288 again in a few days (when I get paid). Billing cycle doesn't end until the 7th and today is the 1st. They shut off service and say I gotta pay 63 to restore service....customer service is a joke. Looking at switching carriers as I write this. DONE WITH T MOBILES LIES,0
The way T mobile handled my situation they do t even deserve the 1star!  When I initially ordered the phone I was happy with the amount I was going to spend on the iPhone 13 and the plan I chose.  When I got the email that it was shipped I checked the tracking immediately to see how long I would be without a phone.  When I saw the comments from ups it stated that they recieved and empty package and three away the box and was reporting the shipment damaged to t mobile.  I immediately called.  I was at work it was around 630 pm at 1am I was still on the phone trying to get another one.  They canceled my order and started a entire new contract.  It was never the same as the 1st.  I waited for the email to electronically sign I never got it then had to call again the next day.  When I called they said the second contract had been canceled due to no electronical signature how can I sign something I never got! So then a third cat contract with generated and it was never the same of course as a first one why I don't know but they were supposed to fix it did they no! So then I was in Hawaii when I got my bill and it was $400 and something dollars and I was on vacation I called they told me I had to send the phone back and that they had to send me another one why couldn't they just fix it with all the things that they can do nowadays and it's 2024 they just couldn'tType a few things on their computer and do it right or make it right no I had to send it from Hawaii back to T-Mobile and they sent me another one so here's my fourth contract still wasn't the same as the first one I had to call every single month after that to get my bill adjusted to the correct amount I was first promised every month finally on the 3rd or 4th month I said I am done I am done I'm tired of calling you all can't make this right I don't want to be a part of T-Mobile anymore so they took it back even though it had been more than the 30 days or whatever and that made me happy I was glad I was unhappy I had to send it back and start another phone deal but I was happy that they were taking this one back and I was getting away from T-Mobile and now they're saying I owe them over $100 induce for my bill but they kept my $116 that was supposed to be a refund and I have the emails and everything to prove it all I have conversations after conversations that they could all listen to but do they ever no they don't if are you I would stay far far away from T-Mobile because they're very unprofessional and they break their promises!   I can not believe they are one of the top sellers with the experience I had and am STILL having with T mobile!!! Horrible service,0
"Called about a automated message that keeps calling me 20 times or more a day for over a month.  The first person I talked to recommended their scam shield, I told them I have it and use it but all that does is send it to my voicemail and that still alerts me I have voice mail all hours of the day and night.  I asked to speak with level 2 support, they put me in hold for about 30 minutes when finally I got a ringing sound and then a message stating they can't take my call.  Excellent customer support (not), they couldn't even come back on the line to say they would call me back or anything.  After being a customer for over 20 years I'll be moving to Verizon this weekend.  T-Mobile doesn't care about their customers at all.",0
"I went to get an account with T-Mobile. The guys in the store told me I needed to call customer care. I went to my car to make this call. The guys said it would be quick. The robot at the beginning of the call said 30 minute wait time. It was an entire hour! And then the customer care guy said he needed to talk to the guys in the store. The call dropped just as I walked into the store. They guys in the store just shrugged. I walked out in frustration. A few weeks later, I got a bill for my supposed service. It was only for $5.65, but I feel it just adds insult to injury.",0
"in the past month, I have spent $18 twice for charging cables at T-Mobile. Neither one of them would last two weeks they are made in China very low quality. This is what T-Mobile thinks of their customers.",0
"customer service is the worst.  I have been a sprint customer since 1998 then they went to tmobile.Absolutely the worst experience ever.  They said they have no account associated with my phone number, well you take my automatic payment for 25 years.  This was my last draw with them.  And if you call customer service expect a 30 minute wait.  Then they direct you to a store.  Now the acquired another company this is just great, and now try to get someone who speaks the same english you speak.",0
First of all I’m not happy I had to give any stars at all. T-Mobile has become the worse mobile carrier. I purchased a phone a year ago paid cash and 30 days later phone was not working properly so I call T-Mobile. They sent me a refurbished phone after I just gave them almost 1300 dollars for a new phone. Over the last 8 months I’ve had 4 refurbished phones because they don’t work properly. I honor my part of our contract which is paying but T-Mobile doesn’t provide me with a working phone nor service. I’ve had only 2 bars on this phone since I’ve received it and now I’m on hold to get refurbished phone sent out to me again. 5 phones in one year. I’m now looking into switching with another company.,0
"I received an e-mail that informed me my monthly bill will go up by $2. That was last week. Today I see news of T-Mobile is acquiring U.S. Cellular for $4.4b. That explains the $2/mo increase… I, and others, are paying for T-Mobile’s acquisition costs. Outrageous! Insulting. I’m infuriated by this garbage. And should I find a better plan, you bet I’m going to switch. If I’m paying more for the acquisition of another cellular provider, I should receive stock + dividends. I’m just a pawn ♟️ in this larger chess game. Wish I had attorneys who’d look out for me, and Sue T-Mobile ~ formerly Primeco. I’d like to kick that pink alien 🤖 phone in the circuits.",0
"If I could give them a 0. I would they said that they were cheaper than Att and  what I got a phone And 2 watches, I open them. It was a hard time switching my phone number over from ATt And I did this in January of 2024 I wrapped the stuff up. Sent it right back that same day. They receive the items. They said that I owed them $350. In actuality, they owed me $240 for my taxes. They sent me to collections, and now I'm having to dispute this before they put it on my credit. I've talked to T-Mobile numerous times from January. Tell June. Them telling me oh yeah, we're going to send you your money back. You don't owe us anything. We're gonna put a dispute in b******* now. I'm talking to the collection agency because t mobile sent it, to collections. This has been really stressful. I've talked to multiple people at T-Mobile. Even gave them my bank account information. They said that they would put it in my account in 1 to2  days never did. Do not work with T-Mobile. They'll rip you off. And then try to send you 2 collections. I worked really hard on my credit. I have a high credit score, but they don't care",0
"I've been with T-Mobile for 23 years. My phone broke. I went in for another one. They offered me a promotion. My bill went from $85 to a 140 for a promotion. What kind of a promotion is that that you're you're making me think I have a deal but really? I'm gonna pay for it in the long run, so keep your promotions to yourself T-Mobile. Been with you 23 years. I'm about ready to exit",0
CUSTOMER CARE WAIT TIME HORRENDOUS AND INCOMPETENT,0
I would give this a minus star if I  could I had an emergency problem and this phone keeps hanging up its a disaster I recommend any one to research this company before doing business with them it's the worst service ever,0
"WORST EXPERIENCE!I am a brand new member at the excelsior springs, Mo location on Jesse James Rd and within the first 14 days I spoke to many chat reps and made 2 visits to the store. I have kept all the screenshots for evidence. Apparently it’s okay for T-Mobile sales reps to attempt to rip off customers for $750+ plus dollars when I was later told should’ve only been $70 when trying to do a buyer’s remorse. Apparently it’s okay for sales representatives to add a phone line to my account illegally without my permission and access all my banking information and cause my credit to go down 27 points. I tried to resolve this and T-Mobile ultimately told me they are not doing anything to make it right and that’s it’s my problem. I would not recommend them to anyone.",0
I've been getting slow/no data service in my area in these past 3 weeks since they didn't say they were fixing/upgrading their cell towers. This stuff is infuriating man.,0
"As a result of many problems dealing with T-Mobile customer service, I successfully got away from T-Mobile a couple of months ago; their billing practices are so miserable, my final invoice showed they owed me $89 and change. Since it's been a couple of months since I got that statement, I called this morning to ask where my money is. I had to spend 17 minutes on the phone to find out the representative had no idea how to issue my refund.So it's your job to wait when when T-Mobile's customer service doesn't know how to do their jobs. They have to go ask someone, you get to wait and the results you get back may or may not reflect the truth. Yet another reason I'm convinced I did the right thing in leaving T-Mobile.",0
"The UNCARING Carrier. Support is awful, and slow to respond. Website is slow, and extremely poorly designed. Today, my T-mobile Magenta (5 lines) is $155 per month. Next month it is $180. No change in my plan but price.. I still get the same garbage service and support for more money according to my support call today! Thank you! President sells over $6 million in stock just weeks before this change is made. Good for him. Bad for all of his customers. The NEW plans after the government allowed them to increase prices after the sprint merger had the SAME benefits as my Magenta but cost more. Now they are identical. There were guarantees and locks in place, and they simply don't care. I no longer trust a company that does not honor a guarantee. That is called lying. I am looking into another carrier now and plan to take advantage of the uncontract promise I AM entitled to (where they pay your last month if you leave do to a price change). I FULLY expect them to have lied about that guarantee also!",0
They seemingly lie about stuff and hold the phone hostage when you cancel their service lock the phone even though it's paid off.,0
"I've spent more than 2 months trying to resolve an over-billing issue - including speaking to at least 2 supervisors, who promised to review the account and call me back in 24 to 48 hours. Never received a call back and the issue is still open. Incredibly bad customer service - time to find a new carrier!",0
"Having a worst experience with T mobile, the horrible customer service ever. We ordered 3 lines and new phones which were not delivered to us as no one was at home, they received the devices back. Still we being charged for more than $500 initial fees and calling them for refund from past one month. Adding to that we received mobile service invoice for $278 today for the service we never used. Really!!! It’s a nightmare. Please be cautious while switching to T-mobile.",0
"T-mobile is THE WORST mobile service company around. I quit them in April to go back to Spectrum and they were still charging me for Ipad services, would not consider a one and last time courtesy leniency. The customer service is substandard, and no matter what promotion they are offering, you'll wind up being taxed even after you complete your plan commitment.",0
T moble agebt in May 2023 informed me that my apple tv was up and i would have to pay to keep. Now i been paying and tmoble is now saying no it on us for lifetime. Agent i was talking to did not document anyyhing we talked about. also new agent today just aburtly transfered me to tech support. Tech support was in dark why i was transfered. I was in dark i was being transfered. Such bad customer service.,0
The worst company and customer service!  ! Just for transfer phone number to another customer it took a forever ! Waiting 6 hours on the phone! Never recommend this company! Be careful guys!,0
T-Mobile sales dept is deceitful. I transferred from Verizon thinking I was saving $50 only to find out that my free watches are not free. I am paying for the watches and I am now paying for two additional lines. These two additional lines were never discussed during my phone conversation. T-Mobile refuses to do anything to rectify this situation. I clearly stated my desire to have a lower bill and was deceived.,0
"My complaint for Tmobile is that I don't think their sales associates are as concerned with helping customers as they are with making sales. I was suckered into a ""free"" smart watch a few years ago. I had to pay $40 to have it activated and then a $15 a month payment was added to my monthly bill. I could not have this removed for 2 years unless I was willing to pay the full price of the watch. They would not let me return it even after only one week.My second and more recent complaint is with my experience yesterday. I went in to upgrade my phone. Initially I was told that I would only have to pay sales tax, but because my screen was cracked my phone had no value as a trade-in. Which is fine because I've been paying their $18 a month insurance since 2017. I mentioned this to the sales associate, and instead of helping me use the insurance, which she is equipped to do, she instead tried to pitch selling me the new phone for full price with a more expensive plan. This would be ignorant to do, and not in my best interest, as I can just wait a few days for the insurance to send me a replacement to use as a trade-in.These big cellphone companies are starting to get a little too predatory for my liking, and I've decided to start looking into alternatives such as PureTalk.",0
"T-Mobile blows chunks..,!!Unfortunately this review panel makes you at least give a start even be able to put in a review but as far as I'm concerned T-Mobile is the worst and will always be the worst they ruined my business.......Their salespeople are snakes....they're liars cheats and thieves just like all of them........I wasn't able to access any of my emails phone calls because of their two step verification system on my iPhone and then took me to court to prove all this with their legion of lawyers instead of helping their customers. I'm sure I'm not the first and I definitely won't be the last as far as I can tell this company's motto should be we don't give one rat's ass about any of you. Give us your money cuz that's all we care about.",0
"T-Mobile Business Internet is (still) a mess and a joke.As both a T-Mobile Home Internet user AND T-Mobile Business Internet user, it is astounding how different the user experience is for both products.  Through my experience, it is straight forward and simple on the T-Mobile Home Internet side to have questions answered, access my account, and to ultimately receive internet.On the contrary, the business process is a mess.  For one, you work through a representative, which sounds good in theory to have that personal experience; however, that representative changed hands 4 times in the first year.  So, when they ""accidentally"" sent me 3 boxes and charged me separately for all 3 lines, you would think they'd have documentation and process in place for handing things off when a representative changes.  Nope.  Not at all.  Not only did it require multiple e-mails and phone calls to explain the situation, the previous representative was told to ""no longer work my account"" by their manager, so they couldn't step in and help if they wanted to (so I'm told).  Just an odd way to conduct business if you want to provide that ""personal"" touch through representatives.Adding another layer of poor a poor user experience.  There is a business support line (which, makes sense as representatives don't want to handle the simple day-to-day things like changing a password), but the issue here is the inconsistency of both sides forwarding you to the other for things that are above a password reset and below needing a new product.  It's incredibly frustrating as a user of this product.Oh - one more example of how poor the business home internet processes are.  When selling my business and changing hands, instead of transferring the my device and my account to the new owner, they sent him a new device and added that device onto my account.  So although I was able to cancel my device, my account remained active receiving charges from the new device they sent the new business owner.  All through this, no communication was received on my end.It's just shocking to me how poor the Business Internet process and experience is relative to the Home Internet.  Could not contrast more.",0
"Literally this company can’t get it right. Big blocks of emails will come thru all at once on various email accounts because their network is slow.  Never trust a word out of their in store reps mouths. It’s always incorrect.  Calling in to their phone line to fix incorrect information given by their in store reps I am told I am given a paltry credit and my bill is going up to a higher amount.  I then later get the notification that my bill is ready to view and to add insult to injury the higher price I was told it would go is also incorrect and it’s actually higher. In short, terrible cellular and customer service.  Avoid. Not the same company they were 15 years ago when they had good service.",0
They’re not tried to make customer to satisfy!!! I told them tried to get back the device sent it to wrong address. I can never get it back from other company. That’s why I called t-mobile to help to do something for me but they don’t want to do anything with it. Their service is SUCKS!!!,0
"I called to open and account and port my existing number (from family plan) to this new account. 15 days later, 6 representatives on the phone and 2 visits to the physical store:1. The price per month is higher than was quoted on opening the account and the plan is different2. the porting was problematic and i had to deal with it with 5 different people3. once the ""temporary"" number was canceled, i was locked out of my account as this was the number still used for text to log me in4. I was charged for 2 lines, when i only opened an account for one line and i explained this to 5 different people.5. incompetent Customer Service reps and multiple departments handing the same issue.End result: 15 days later i'm on a trip still dealing with it for hours and it's not done.Can't get ""transfer my phone to a new T-mobile account"" TODO off my list in 15 days.",0
"I switched from AT&T after being promised lower charges by T Mobile. At the time we were told that my wife also qualified for a ""free"" Samsung watch. I now get the bill and its higher than my AT&T bill was. When I queried this with T Mobile they said that the additional charges were due to the ""free"" watch. It's also too late to return the watch. Be careful of this company - they are RIPOFF artists. And their customer service sucks too!!!",0
"Hello everyone, i feel very disappointed that T-Mobile start had a bad customer service.  Not like before when you call 611 you can get Customer on the phone quickly or Automictic said press number 1 call you back or number 2 stay on the line. But at this moment they change their policy and let you wait on the line average 45minutes to 3 hours wait time. I very disappointed and i will stop the T-Mobile services and my family. Will change different provider. This is today date May, 7 2024. Bad Services hope this messages will come to the damn Owner.",0
T-Mobile ripped me off.T-Mobile ripped me off. The sales tec for t-mobile said if we upgraded to go 5 we would get phones so we did. They are billing me full retail for the phones 2 months later. I have been through 5 support people and managers with no results. They are thieves. They are telling me that they do not need to stand behind there sales tech. I did a Google search and this has happened to lots of other people. This is there business plan.,0
Do not go to the T Mobile store on Spartanburg Hwy Hendersonville NC. An employee named Conner waited on us He acted like we interrupted whatever he was doing in back room. We wanted to upgrade our phones and we were told that their service was down and that the store was completely out of phones. That was our experience.,0
"Switching to T-Mobile was the worst decision I have made in a long time. The single worst customer service I have ever received from any company period. Promised discounts not delivered. Call after call over months ended in repeated broken promises. It was clear that the rep either had no access to the history of previous conversations or did not care to look. Really seems like they have zero idea what they are doing. I’m on my way back to Verizon just as soon as I can get T-Mobile’s incompetent team to process unlocks on my phones. Don’t get lured in by the lower cost. This company is a nightmare to deal with, right down to their cringey fake “we got you” dialogue.",0
"Worst promise, free phones end up they did not honor their contract so I am paying for the phones paying for the activation. They are a bunch of scumbags.",0
I responded to a promo. It took 3 days to get results. Long waits on calls and hangup. When I did get to speak to a rep they would spend most of their time asking me to wait. The web site was even worse and basically does not work. When all was said and done the $40 promo cost me $60.,0
I had Verizon for a year and half and I never had any data problems. My phone or hotspot is always slow. I switched to -mobile because they’d pay off my phone as a promotion. It’s $50 cheaper than Verizon but everything is so slow. I regret switching providers. You get what you pay for I guess. Imma get a Ryan Reynolds’s phone!,0
"Was overcharged and support refuses to refund what they overcharged me, including their hidden fees. Also coverage and signal is garbage. They should remove 5G/6G and go back to to LTE/4G.",0
Worse customer service I've ever experienced. When you need customer service they push you to self help like all of them. Submitted an unlock request phone completely paid off. Spoke with two different reps and both said it would take a week and they would call me back neither did. Call back in spoke with supervisor named Mary. She apologize and said it would be unlocked in 48 hrs. After 2 weeks I called back and spoke with  a Harrison. He stated he needed to reverify everything and wanted to know why I wanted my phone unlocked. I told him I already spoke with supervisor and was approved for unlock. He refused. I requested a call back f4om Mary or cancel the service. He immediately canceled my service. Horrible customer service. Never a warm transfer. Never read or I guess put notes on the account. Every rep will tell you something different. After signing up you're on your own.  Buyer beware!!!!!!,0
"My family and I have been T-Mobile customers for over 20 years. On April 15 2024 my iPhone 13 Pro suddenly went into SOS mode. Meaning my phone lost service. I have not been connected to the T-Mobile network that I pay for since then. Since April 15, I have spent countless hours everyday, basically spending every moment of free time that I have calling T-Mobile tech-support to resolve this issue. I have been on multiple calls with Verizon and T-Mobile to resolve this issue. Apparently my IMEI number was blocked by Verizon, although I have never been a Verizon customer, like I mentioned above, my family, and I have only ever been T-Mobile customers for decades. Verizon has confirmed that they have unblocked my IMEI, they even confirm that with a T-Mobile supervisor on a conference call with me. I was told by the tech associate that they would call me back on a working line, knowing that my phone didn’t work, and apparently they called my blocked phone line and left a message which is another example of the carelessness and neglect of T-Mobile and my issue. Every single time I call I’m having to re-explain myself and I’ve been extremely patient with each and every T-Mobile representative I’ve spoken to never raising my voice and always respectful, but I am at my absolute limit. After multiple T-Mobile representatives have promised me with callbacks with solutions and never hearing back. I feel like this company doesn’t care about this major inconvenience, stress causing, and dangerous situation this issue has become. As a young woman in my 20s, not having any cell phone service for over a week while having to work an hour away from home has made me feel extremely unsafe and uncared for by T-Mobile as a company. I am traveling in two days and feel immensely anxious and unsafe with the idea of being out of state with no phone service. If something happens to me during my travels, how will I be able to contact my family? How is that okay?  This has affected my every day peace of mind. At this point, my entire family is ready to leave T-Mobile due to the absolute disappointment of the handling of this issue. I don’t believe it’s fair that I would have to pay for an upgrade for a new phone, which is what I’ve been told is my only immediate solution, when I have a iPhone 13 Pro in perfect condition. I am being forced to pay a new phone due to T-Mobile’s inability to solve an issue that is not my fault? That is unfair. I was told I was eligible for a warranty trade-in and then within 24 hours told I was not due to the issue being escalated and having to be seen through.I don’t think a $20 credit or a warranty replacement is worth all the time and energy I have put in by trying to fix this issue, especially as an extremely loyal T-Mobile customer, who has done nothing but treat the T-Mobile staff with upmost respect during this very frustrating issue, after the countless promises of call backs and solutions that not a single T-Mobile associate has kept.",0
"T-Mobile says iPhone on us. That means free to the consumer. They deceive you with statement credits which require you to stay with them for 24 months or you pay full price for the phone, now your a hostage. It took 3 weeks to receive a ""free phone"" just to find out it's not truly free. If it was free, I'd be free to leave anytime due to poor CS , poor signals and outright crappy overall verbage from their "" global partners"" poor understanding of the English language. There's no freedom in Amerika or with T-Mobile. If your looking for more deceptive practices in your life, hook up with Satan and his minions at T-Mobile. You'll get with anger.",0
Terrible company.  Stole $55 from me for internet service I never used,0
"T-Mobile has deceptive trade practices, fraudulent ads and guarantees which they do not honor, and their websites and customer service agents lie.I thought you folks would be interested in the recent experience I had with T-Mobile.Having spotty cell service with our current cell carrier, I was looking at competitive services on my smartphone on April 6 and I came across T-Mobile. Their pricing is quite competitive. I then came across a feature on their phone accessed web site that pushed me to try them.The Go Back Guarantee: On the phone version of their website, they had a large ad, “You'll love it here, guaranteed. With our new $50 Go Back Guarantee, if you're not satisfied within 30 days, you can switch back to your old carrier and get $50 for every voice line. Via virtual prepaid Master card. Allow 5 weeks for card. Get full terms (hyperlink)”The Go Back Guarantee Full Terms: “You'll love it here, guaranteed. Contact us before cancelling or porting out line(s) to request payout. Limited time offer; subject to change. Port-in voice line from postpaid plan w/ eligible carrier (i.e., AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum, Claro, Liberty, Xfinity or US Cellular), and port-out to eligible carrier within 30 days of T-Mobile line activation required. Account must be in good standing (e.g., final bill paid) to receive virtual prepaid MasterCard (no cash access & expires in 6 months). Up to 12/account. One offer per subscriber. Not available for customers that cancelled T-Mobile service within the past 90 days. Card is issued by Sunrise Banks N.A., Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Mastercard(sic) International Incorporated. Use of this card constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions stated in the Cardholder Agreement.”I showed my wife and her sister this guarantee and they agreed it was worth a try.I went to their store on April 7 and got their service.By April 11, it was evident T-Mobile wasn't working for us.I went to the store who told me to contact Customer Care by phone.The Customer Care agent eventually handed me over to a supervisor who repeated what the CC agent was telling me, “This guarantee promotion didn't start until today (April 11) and cannot be honored for service purchased prior.” The supervisor claimed he didn't see the Go Back Guarantee on the website even though I told him where it was within the web site to see it, but he claimed he didn't see it.  He said T-Mobile could not honor the guarantee.  Per the guarantee, I had yet to cancel T-Mobile, nor had I started service with another carrier.Since then, the guarantee has been removed from the desktop website, though it still exists on the phone website.  Regardless, T-Mobile refuses to back up the advertised guarantee.Per T-Mobile's advertised guarantee, they owe me $100 (for two lines), a guarantee they refuse to honor.How many others have had the 'promotion' not start until AFTER their service has started???",0
"Was Paid ahead when I switched to Mint mobile. I still had at least 15 days left when I cancelled T-Mobile. I just figured that money was my loss. Cancelled the middle of March Then I received 2 bills on the same day, one dated April 5th for $41.44 and one dated April 10th for $13.82. The second one had a $7.00 late fee as part of it. Called them and the guy was supposed to call me back within 2 days. Never happened. I just called them back. I got nowhere. anyway, I paid the $13.82 and told her I need to get off of the phone and go leave a bad review. They don't like that. Then she was going to give me the $7.00 late fee back but she found out she cant do that on an account that was cancelled. Anyway do what you will but I don't recommend them.",0
Customer service was very rude. The conversation went in circles.  The conversation was so rude. I asked for a recording of the conversation and was denied access to it.  But it was mention at the beginning of the phone call that it was recorded for different purposes.  Well I would like to turn this conversation over to the CEO of T-Mobile my phone call was not handled properly and if something isn't done about. I'm taking my actions to someone else.,0
"Please do not move to T Mobil. They are the worse phone company in the world. It was a big mistake moving with them 2 years ago. I will never make the same mistake again. So please do yourself a favor, and not to stress yourself. Customer service suck and they are good in telling you lies. T Mobil they are the worse carriers.",0
"When I send emails from my cell phone, sometimes with their service, it shows they went through, but people never received them.   Also, if you are ever going into a physical store, you can’t believe anything that comes out of one of their sales reps mouth.  They have a general idea about things, but no clue as to how things actually work; as was the case when I signed up for their free Wi-Fi on domestic flights and free Netflix plan. Everything the rep told me was completely wrong. That, of course, could impact your buying decision when you’re being given misleading information.",0
"I have purchased two Iphones and one Samsung phone in the past 4 years from T-mobible and just added a second line.  A month later I get this email:ACTION NEEDED by 05/08/2024.

To continue receiving the $10.00 AutoPay discount, you must update your payment method to a debit card or a bank account.Visit your T-Mobile account to update your payment method and keep your discount by 05/08/2024.I call 611 and get customer service that is pathetic.

"I have had t mobile internet for about 9 months. I have not had internet for 5 days.  I was told to go to my nearest store which is in Sturgis , Michigan to pick up a new Sim card . Well that didn't solve the problem , so now I'm back at the store & these two guys working are thee worst employees at any store I've ever  been in  . Completely rude ! Told me the tech guy who sent me to the store to get a new modem doesn't know what he's talking about . How I should never have been directed to go to the store & ask for help. They are so rude because I didn't have my receipt from  10 months ago they won't can't help me . I got the service originally from this store so why can't they just look my name up? Why did they kick me out of their store without helping me . Completely ridiculous.  I will never be a customer of tmobilr again & I'm telling everyone I know how awful t mobile employees are !",0
I tried to sign up with T-Mobile and their website is glitchy and their sales reps aren't helpful at all. Horrible first impression.,0

"Lousy phone company when they get you as a customer what they do is rob you for a garbage service, bad signal, bad data and lousy attention, over costs in the bills that even they do not know how to explain.

TMobile is childish and unprofessional I had to call several times because reps would sit in the phone and laugh not just that T-Mobile is the reason my Info is on the dark web I don't recommend doing business with this company they're bs,0
"I signed up for service online and ordered a phone. My daughter decided to put me on her service, family plan since it would be easier on me since I'm on disability and have limited income. I called T-Mobile to cancel and they said that since I haven't received the phone yet when the driver arrives with it, to refuse the phone and they will cancel the service, no problem. That is what I did. I received a bill in the mail for almost $200! I called them and my daughter called them. They said to go to the store in Evansville, IN to tell them and they would handle it. I went to the store and they said to talk to the corporate office about it! I made two payments with two checks, in two months. In the amount owed. Now they sent me another bill saying that I hadn't paid the last bill for $71.58 and now I owe them an additional $7! I have a canceled check that proves I paid. I guess I will have to get the BBB involved. My advice is always to pay by check so you can rub it in their faces that you paid them! And keep your receipts for at least three years in case they try to take you to court for nonpayment. I have so many businesses to do that because if they can get you to pay twice to recover losses in other areas, they will. Do not use T-Mobile. Their customer service is non-existent and they use people that have a thick foreign accent that you can't understand them. When you ask them to speak slower, they ignore you. I plan on looking long and hard for a new service, but from the other reviews on here about other carriers, it's very depressing. And yes, they need to redo the stars to have a ""no star"" option on here.",0
"I scheduled a payment arrangement for $195. The payment didn’t go through from my Navy Federal account so I paid $195 from a different account. What I didn’t know is even though I paid , they tried a second time to take the payment out of Navy Federal and it went through. So making it a total of $390 within 3 days. After calling customer support to ask for 1 payment to be returned, they said they couldn’t do it because there was a balance on my account. I’m so angry because they know this is not right! So they are keeping the extra $195 and they don’t give a crap about my bank account being in the negative because of them resubmitting a payment that I already took care of…. Shame on you T-Mobile!!! But again they don’t give a Crap about their own customers!!",0

"I would give T-Mobile negative stars. I return the equipment within a week to remain with current provider. I received email they received the equipment back. They kept charging my bank card for a service I never used for equipment I don’t have. I ended up calling them to cancel everything. They charge my bank card again. The problem is I ended up stopping my card. They couldn’t pull money out of my account. Now, they have collection agency after me. I called them and was lied to. The guy was disrespectful on the phone.",0

"Been with them for 3 years.  Have been treated like trash.  I broke my phone, got a revvl 6x pro 5g which is junk.  Had it less than 12 hours went to get different phone which customer service told me I could do.  However, the store rep wanted me to reshelf it for $100.  Phone only cost 189 to 229.  No one informed me of reshelving fees.  So I am stuck with a phone no blue tooth for zoom calls which I have to have for doctors, disconnects calls, overheats, doesn't charge until after 4 hours, drops calls and the speaker doesn't work.  I get to keep this piece of crap for 2 years.  I submitted this section on April 9, 2024Here's a little update as of April 11, 2024. I was informed to stop calling customer service on this issue so they screwed me over on this phone they have no intention of calling me back and making it right please stay away from T-Mobile.",0

"I was a Tmobile Customer almost 25 years, never late or missed a payment. Decided to go to Xfinity Mobile for a better dream.Tmobile was all nice, told me if I wanted to come back they would save my no for me!  Then in about a month I get a 480.00 bill and I am 68 years old, fixed income, and it tore my nerves up bad! I called Tmobile thinking there was a computer glitch! They informed me that about 15 years ago I had got a thing call boost device and that I had to bring it in or they were going to charge me 480.00. I didn’t even know what they were speaking of, still don’t. I said why if I owed you anything would you wait 15 plus years to tell me, they said it was because I switched to another company! I have no idea what they are talking about, I have lost two sons and a husband in that 15 years. I am so upset with a company that as a realtor I promoted , didn’t get very good service , especially outside of town but I stuck with them and this is the thanks I get! I feel if I owed them for something they should have told me 15 years ago or longer.But to say I owe them fo a booster I never heard of it and I feel so betrayed by a company I stood by for 25 years! Dont have 480.00! to pay them , am mad and broken heated to be treated in such a way! I would have maybe went back to Tmobile, but as far as I am concerned I would use a tin can to communicate, at least it wouldn’t slap me in the face and treat me like Tmobile has!  The date of my experience started in around 2005 and ended in March 2024.",0
"If I could give negative stars I would. I canceled my services with this company over six months ago, I paid a full month of service that they did NOT provide, returned all the equipment and now, SEVEN months later I received a bill for a past due amount of $21. They will never stop billing me for stupid reasons. How can I have a past due bill from an account that does not exist? Stay away from Tmobile!!! They are the most terrible company to get services from. I left because of all the problems with billing, connection, you name it. Worst experience ever 😡",0
Wrong people to have service with. They abuse the options to make their time spent just for money not quality or better reviews my experience was bad refurbished devices has defective calibration and issues the service is bad not helpful to customer than lead to paying after ignoredNot worth to keep yes pay to get yourself away from their contact they are sick bad.,0

Well let’s start with the fact that I’ve had T-Mobile for quite sometime and yet they decided to screw me over with international calls. I went overseas for work for 2 months. My phone was on WiFi calling I made sure and this isn’t my first time overseas doing this. They told me I had $434 charges in international calls and I argued with them but unfortunately they sent it to collections. So my advice to anyone is to steer clear of Tmobile and as a veteran I do not recommend them. Money hungry companies like this need to be shut down and they need to be held accountable for destroying peoples credit. Funny how phone companies don’t boost your credit yet they can destroy your credit… Seems fair.,0

I was  extremely upset with T-Mobile.  This is the second issue I had with T-Mobile, their system was compromised and my Identity was stolen.  It's been a nightmare with this phone carrier.",0
"They have by far the WORST cell service in the country I have to drive 3 miles from my house to get one bar to be able to call someone, it’s absolutely ridiculous. I randomly lose cell service all the time even while in town. Verizon was 10x better than this garbage!",0
"I dealt with Kevin and Demetrious at the Monroe/Talmadge location in Toledo, OH.  My 16-year-old son signed up for a phone using the T-Mobile app without parental consent.  He did not lie about his age, even used his driver’s license and social security card.  Demetrious wouldn't even listen to me, instead immediately insinuated my son lied about his age, which bothered me and when I said I didn't want to pay the $70 restock fee, he said ""ok we're done here"" and slid the phone across the table.  I had not raised my voice and was nothing but respectful.Then I tried to tell him he didn't know what he was talking about because my son used his real age - and Demetrious started lecturing me on how he has a bachelor’s and master’s degree.  Demetrious then left the conversation, and for the whole time we were there waiting for them to cancel the line (after I paid the fee) Demetrious would not even look at me or acknowledge me.  I have no idea what T-Mobile is teaching their managers, but Demetrious immediately escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it.I also dealt with Kevin, whom I asked, ""have you ever heard the term 'the customer is always right?'""  He said, ""we both know that's not true.""  Wow.  I will never do business with T-Mobile anywhere, and the company should be ashamed of how their employees treat customers.  But hey, Demetrious has a master’s degree y'all.  He knows better than all of us.",0

"I wish I could give -5 stars. Unbelievably unethical behavior.Here's my story- I left them for Verizon. When I closed my account they said that we were all settled up and there were no other charges.- 9 months later, I get a credit report alert that they created a new charge and sent it to collections. No phone call, text, or email as a warning.- I call them, after 4 hours they agree that they would honor the promise originally made (that there would be no further charges) and would remove the charge. I think that's the end of it- One year later, I get another credit alert. They didn't remove the charge, they just sat on it it- Call them up, they accuse me of lying that this previous exchange ever happened (even though I read them the notes I made during the call from the incident) and insist that the charge is valid- I agree to pay the ransom to make the problem finally go away ($241)Stay away",0

T Mobile has poor customer service for everything you have to call them 100 times,0
"We started our service online then had to call customer service and they sent the phones through fed ex. From the time we received the phones they never got service. I could call 611 to get to customer if I was in one spot in a driveway. 2 days of being on phone with customer service they said we had to take the phones to a T-Mobile store 21 miles away to return them since our service wouldn't work in our area. We did that they charged our bank $4 and something and now 2 weeks later charged our bank $100 for a months service. We never even had service the two plus days we had the phones. I called and they put in a request to credit it back and she said the request is pending. Then I get a letter in the mail that our bill is over due for $100. I called my bank and they said they couldn't stop the payment but if they did it again I could stop payment on another and it would cost me $35. BEWARE of T-Mobile, never again if we move again will I try them or recommend them. It cost $140 to try them out and be without phone service for 3 days. One mad customer when we live in limited social security retirement.Update: they took another $15 out of our account, I guess $100 wasn’t good enough for 2 or 3 days of no service 😡",0
"This company is HORRIBLE. Practically STOLE money from me and my family.  I was using t-mobile for over 10 years and was a loyal customer. Never missed 1 payment. However, they would do some sketchy things with my bill that had Me question the company’s credibility over the last few years I was with them.Initially, I wouldn’t check my bill statements and this was a mistake because T-Mobile would charge me for things that I never used or purchased. When I would call customer service, they would lie and say I did purchase (a plan, an equipment etc), but I know that I never had purchased anything additional.   When I would ask them to remove those things, they would confirm over the phone verbally that they would be removed from my plan- months would go by, they would remove it initially and then it will be added on again.  I was the sole authorized user on my account and so no one else had access to make any changes to my plans.After a few years of dealing with this, and having to stay with T-Mobile because I was under a phone contract for two years, I finally decided to leave. However, when I left, guess what happened?They charged me for an additional month, AFTER, I left because I had left my card on file before closing my account. When I transferred my number to another company T-Mobile automatically removed my access to all of my files, to my online account - everything, so I could not remove any of my personal information since they took my account away!  So, I tried disputing the charge and they gave me an excuse that they had to charge me because I never paid the first month of service… what?  Whatever, I couldn’t get my money back….. But then, two months later, they sent me another bill saying I owed an equipment I never returned from back in 2016. I was STUNNED!  I never purchased the equipment they said I had purchased in-store, I also never saw this “charge” on ANY of my bills throughout my time with the company.I was so certain I was done with T-Mobile and then they send me to collections ??I had done EVERYTHING to avoid this prior to leaving. I went to the store, closed my account, received verbal and physical confirmation that everything was paid for and I received the last three month invoices to confirm it. Yet they still found a way to send me to collections for something I have no record or recollection of?  How the hell do they get away with this fraudulent behavior?  I’m not the only person I know that they have done this with. I am so upset!  I will never use T-Mobile again!! I will never recommend them to anyone.   They’re over priced, and they are fraudulent!! Once you’re ready to leave them, that’s when they want to make things even worse for you financially.Don’t ever use T-Mobile!! Mint Mobile has been amazing for me.  I live in NYC and it works JUST like, if not better than T-Mobile service. I pay 35$ a month and I have no unexpected fees.Now time for me to fight with collections over this T-Mobile bill …. Wish me luck.(Written by Rafael B.)",0
"In short, when I tried to add cell phones to the 5G internet service I had set up the day before, they set up a new account that was linked to the interim cell phone numbers, instead of the email address I had linked to the account the day before (I did not know I had two accounts).  I had autopay set up for the first account, which was apparently not being used. They started charging for the two phone lines before they were even able to be set up, with all of the necessary transfer actions.  They shut down my home internet service for lack of payment, even though I was paying on the first account, so I had to pay $270 to reactivate it (while I was in two online meetings needed for income) without a bill to know what I was paying for.  Subsequently, the necessary items were complete to transfer the cell phones and the only thing T-mobile was able to do was render the cell phones as bricks and make it so that they didn't work at all.  After spending over 10 hours on the phone with them, they started telling me I had to wait 24 hours for provisioning to occur, 18 hours after we first  started to try the transfer.  Ultimately, my wife needed functional phones, so then I switched to verizon.  Even though the only function T-mobile served was to kill my wife's phones, they will not refund the $160 for the cell phone services that they were not able to activate, the late fee for payment of a bill that was only sent to a nonexistent phone number, or the reactivation fee.  So they want me to pay for a service that they couldn't provide solely because I signed up for it.  I have now paid $330 to T-mobile for a partial month of a $60 service, with no recourse.  Unfortunately, at the moment, T-mobile is the only viable home internet service in the area other than Starlink.",0

I was planning on going on the 55+ plan but changed my mind. I called T-Mobile asked if I should mail the sim cards they sent me back. They told me to destroy them. They proceeded to charge me for 3 months even though I never activated a phone through them. They said since I never closed the account they could charge me whether I had phone service or not. The 55+ plan was supposed to be $55 a month. T-Mobile charged me $76.20 a month for 3 months on a credit card I used to get the Sim Cards. I would advise anyone thinking of doing business with T-Mobile avoid them like the plague.,0
"Customer service is garbage. When you were on the phone for an hour and a half and they do absolutely nothing to resolve your issue and you find out that they had signed you up for a plan on your eight-year-old iPad. That’s for $34.99 that has international calling and things that she will never use instead of the service that has more data Without all the extra features for $15… I still have no service at home on any of my devices and the customer service representative after an hour and a half who did nothing, hung up on me. She told me to go to the store and get new Sims cards for all of my devices. Now make that makes sense. I told her no that they would tell me to call her and she hung up..",0
"For context, I'm currently stationed in northern Japan. Back in mid Dec 2023, all T mobile users here suffered a service outage. I called tech support and they acknowledged that there was a tower issue and they are working to resolve it. Approximately 3 weeks go by and I finally have my data back. I called customer support to discuss the possibility of getting some kind of credit since I went 3 weeks to both of my lines without any service. First she offered $50. I told her that I didn't think it was a fair compensation on a $142 bill so she agreed and offered to cover the full amount. A week goes by and no adjustment, I contacted them again and they reassured that it was being worked. A few more weeks goes by and no adjustment. I made contact again and they now tell me a person named Ronalyn had to review and approve the credit. More time goes by and I sent another message asking for Ronalyn and all they could do is send her a message asking her to give me a call back. In the meantime they credited me $20 two times for a total of $40 saying that was all they were allowed to credit me for. I called one last time in mid March 2024 and the lady I spoke had her management team review all the chat history for the last 3 months. She acknowledged about the promise of the credit however stated that it was a FALSE promise. No one on her team not even her managers could help me and that the only thing she can do is put in another message to Ronalyn from the San Anotonio dept to give me a call but even then she could promise me that she would call. 3 and half months since this issue and still not resolved. $40 credit on a $142.11 bill  when I had no service at all for 3 out of the 4 weeks, is that fair compensation? I will state that when I was with Sprint I never had issues. Tmobile has absolutely been Horrible!",0

"I was a loyal customer for 14 years who ported my line last month.  Prior to porting, I called to ask if the fees would be prorated or would I be billed for a full month regardless of the date.  The young lady confirmed it would be prorated and a refund would be issued.  Not only was the fees not reimbursed, they were also trying to charge me additional fees.I asked to speak to a supervisor to explain my concerns and Mark, the supervisor, was not only unpleasant but rude.  He stated it was company ""standard"" rules to keep the entire payment regardless of the port date.  As I continued to explain what was communicated to me, he put me on mute and returned only to repeat ""company standard rules"" and to let me know his decision was final.I asked the name of rep who transferred me to which he replied he could not give out anyone's name nor could he refund any monies.Not only was he rude, he hung up in my face.This company cares NOTHING about people.

"We switched back from Verizon and it was the worst choice.

At this point, a little extra money on Verizon is worth it considering we pay 230 dollars a month for our phones not to work.Also annoyed that one reason we did switch was ""Netflix on us"" with no ads. To get an email that oh we're going to ad supported because we're also giving you Hulu... on exactly one plan you get Hulu, so now we're paying 8 extra dollars a month plus 30 for a 3rd line we were told was free when joining, only to be told that oh you're on a military plan so that doesn't apply, even though we were clear from the beginning that it was a military plan and told it would be free.Overall a huge mess and the superior customer service isn't enough to keep us anymore.",0

"I was disconnected three times before being able to complete my support request with a T-Mobile representative. I inquired about an additional T-Mobile line of service for a new SyncUp Tracker. I told the representative I was calling to find out what promotions were available. The representative said if I ordered a new line of service, I would receive a new SyncUp Tracker for free. She specifically and unequivocally assured me the device would not be part of any T-Mobile financing agreement. She asked for my credit card to pay the sales tax charge. I provided her with my credit card information. The T-Mobile agent said she would email me an e-signature to sign so she could ship out the device. When the e-signature form arrived, it carried a 24-month finance agreement. I was extremely suspicious and asked the representative to explain. The representative told me, in no uncertain terms, not to worry about it. The representative said the e-signature form was the only form T-Mobile had at the time. The T-Mobile agent said that once the device shipped, the agreement would be cancelled, and I would receive the device for free, without any financing and without having to stay with T-Mobile for 24 months. I signed the agreement, knowing I had the buyer's remorse period as protection. The agent gave me her personal guarantee that I would get a free tracker without the financing agreement. After my phone with the T-Mobile agent, I called T-Mobile and spoke with several representatives as well as a billing supervisor. Each T-Mobile representative said I entered into a financing agreement. None of the subsequent agents or supervisors I spoke with about this incident cared about the fact that a T-Mobile agent had defrauded me. All anyone from T-Mobile had to do was listen to the recorded conversation I had with the dishonorable T-Mobile agent, and it would be clear that the agent deliberately lied to me.I made multiple requests to have the representative I spoke with call me back. I never received a call.",0

"I reached out to T-Mobile for a warranty exchange! They sent me a warranty device to a store! Went to the store The store would not take my device as a warranty! This happened to me three times!

The first warranty device they sent me arrived with a cracked screen! I then had to send it back! Now I've been charged an extra $50 on my bill.

This can’t be legal. They flat out lied about providing a service for a price then changed the price. Scamming company that should be sued til its doors close. Hate this company with a passion.,0
"So back in February I saw AT&T had a special on Samsung S24 Ultra AI phone. The phone with trade in was about 150 for a 1400 phone. So I thought I would do it using my old Note 10+ as a trade in. So got the phone and went into AT&T to have it set up and the Manager says our bad you’re not on the right rate plan if we move you to it the extra cost is 30 a month and the now 14 a month on the phone. I said nope cancel it I will go to T-Mobile for their deal on the same phone.So got all cancelled and was refunded for fees I paid up front to AT&T.I then went to T-Mobile and their deal was a little better on Samsung S24 Ultra AI phone. They required no trade in and would pay AT&T off 179 and give me 800 off the phone and 400 in credits which made the phone free except for taxes and fees which they all have. The guy said they will send an edoc to sign then all is a go. They sent the doc, I e-signed and T-Mobile sent a confirmation email acknowledging I signed. Then crickets for 5 days.Called T-Mobile CS they said oh that order was cancelled because edocs were not signed. I said wait I signed them and here is the confirmation email from T-Mobile confirming that. They said Opps our bad must have been a system error. So, I had to go back to T-Mobile office and redo the order this time signing the edoc in front of the agent. He set up delivery to my house because the one I wanted Titanium Grey was not in stock and the closest store that had it was 60 miles away. Then the UPS issue starts.So, UPS arranged delivery after 5 pm however they came at 9 am, so I rescheduled for 2-5pm the next day and they came at 9 am. I called UPS they said well the driver can change route to save fuel. I said but wait customers don’t know the driver is coming 5 or 6 hours ahead of a scheduled time. Her response Sorry, they will come Friday I said but no one will be there her response then they will send it back to T-Mobile. In the process UPS mishandled the phone and did not return it to T-Mobile.So now third trip to T-Mobile again everything cancelled, and order reconstructed. Only this time I had it sent to work a warehouse where people do receiving all day and UPS is their main shipper. So, Tuesday 3/5/2024 I get confirmation package delivered at dock at 9:37 am. Went down to dock and no package. They said the auto sign has been happening since covid and driver still does it. The warehouse Manager said sometimes they do this then deliver it the next day. I called UPS they said dispatch would call within an hour, no call. So, I called again 2 hours later and again they said dispatch would call within an hour, however no call.Wednesday 3/6/2024 still no package and no one can find it. Filed a claim with T-Mobile and UPS. Then dispatch called to get the information on the lost delivery.Now T-Mobile billed me for a month of service on 2/27/2024 which even if I received the phone on the 2nd week remember they cancelled I would be getting billed a month for 2 weeks usage.They have also not given me credit for the first charge for taxes and turnup of a phone I never received.Now they will have to refund the second charge for taxes and turnup of the second phone I never received.So I received a refund for the 110 usage bill for never using their service I guess it was for the privilege, never the less it was refunded.Then on 3/15/2024 I finally received a refund on the first phone order but still waiting on the second.I called on 3/20/2024 and got the run around from two off shore agents requested over and over a supervisor or on shore customer service then the rep (Al) disconnected the call while I was on hold for a supervisor, right!I called back another rep advised me the claim with T-Mobile was for the first phone no one had opened anything on the second phone. So now I must wait another 7 days for that claim.She asked if I wanted to close account, I said hell yes but not until I get my refund.I thought AT&T had bad CS until I dealt with T-Mobile, T-Mobile is the champion of bad CS.",0
"Customer service is lacking! I had a surgery, out of work on bedrest for a month. Called to explain to them why my first bill was unpaid. They asked for my bank card to set up a future payment arrangement, but their system doesn’t accept prepaid bank cards. I pay all my bills with my debit card. The next morning they disconnected my service. I will be returning their equipment and will advocate to everyone I meet to not waste their money on such a heartless company. Better off sticking with Verizon, at least they have a heart.",0
"Don’t waste your time with this company worst company ever. Save your self all the stress and get fios don’t use Tmobile internet you can be in the best standing, automated payment and this company will sneak over 288. Payments in on a 50 dollar bill. Or tell you they can’t help you because you don’t have a Tmobile phone. Or say well you should have taken it off automatic payments then or you can call your bank and tell them. Never missed a payment never been late. But this company steals money when they can. Which they don’t even give a reason at all or tell you why. Best thing I did was switch I haven’t had an issue or an interruption since I switched. Haven’t had any hidden fees of 288. Dollars or 105. And so on. Let’s not forget how they mocked me when I called and asked for a manager purposely calling me a different names. If they had a zero it would be a zero.",0
"I tried the home internet for 1 day. Returned the device and was charged for the monthly payment. No one can tell me why since the account was deactivated. I called and spoke to 4 representatives, went to 2 stores, didn't get any help there either, and then they don't want to refund me my money. Extremely dissemination and dissatisfied all the way stove. The home internet ducked sucked.",0
"I got a internet service  from T mobile. Had it one day and then returned it with the labels they send me though a email for ups, 2 months later they are billing me 252.00 cause they think they dont have it, but they cant tell awfull  to deal with , plus 2 months they turn me into a credit collection,  and i owe them nothing , disgusting !!",0
"I was a very happy Sprint customer for almost 15 years. Their cellular service was great and their customer service was always outstanding. I was afraid of what would happen when T-Mobile was allowed to purchase Sprint, as I had heard T-Mobile's customer service was nowhere near as good as Sprint. My fears were realized when my family split our accounts when they qualified for a cheaper plan due to their age. I made THREE attempts after the split to change my plan to save myself $40/month, and the first two times each representative said they had changed the plan and still I was charged $110 for a single line. By the 3rd time, I was understandably upset and the customer service representative tried to argue with me about WHEN the change was made to my account. After 10 minutes of this, I told her to forget it and that I was changing services. I am extremely disappointed and angry at the $80 they managed to 'steal' from me over the last 2 months. I do NOT recommend T-Mobile...EVER. Score: F",0
"I am a disabled Veteran and have TMobile service for approximately 15 months.  Since my paydays are different every month, my payments are late sometimes.  As a result of this, they have consistently suspended my services every month for the past 6 months.  I have recently tried to get them to give me a couple extra days to make a payment and keep my service on, but they will not.",0
"This is the absolute worst cell service I have ever had. I’m counting down the days to finish my contract so I can leave. I’ve complained multiple times about dropped calls and lack of service and that even in my own home I only have service half the time, I’m always dismissed with “oh, it’s because you have an iPhone.” And never fix anything. Would highly suggest you never switch to this provider.",0
"After 6 years of giving them an opportunity they turned out to be liers and a company that try to make their customers pay for their wrong doing.  Exchanged 2 phones under warranty and insurance and even a third party UPS confirmed it. They kept telling me they would take care of it on their end without interrupting my business for months and not do business like others after confirming the phones receipt (oddly they don't record it on their end, and UPS confirmed delivery) to fix their error trying to charge me over $2,100 for phones that where insured, paid and received, they disconnected/interrupting my services/business and excused this service where I had to call in for months and they would give their confirmation this would not happen, interrupting my time, business and ultimately having a serious negative impact.  Most of the time I traveled all over the US for work as this is a business line, I would often go without service.",0
"I would give zero stars if I could. I had a business account with this company. While on phone with customers, the phone would drop calls. It became so frustrating that I ported my number to Verizon on 8/8/2023. By the way, I have not had any issues with Verizon. Any who, on September 23, I contacted T-Mobile because I received an unexpected phone bill. The representative stated that there were additional lines that were not ported. I was unaware of these lines because there wasn’t a SIM card or a phone for the lines in question. I asked that the account be canceled on 9/23. The representative stated that they would have to complete an investigation and someone would call me. Unfortunately, that never happened. On October 24th., I called T-Mobile because I received another bill that had accumulated additional charges. This issue was still not resolved due to their incompetent associates. On November 23rd, I contacted T-Mobile again to address the accumulated charges because I was billed on a phone that was not used for the months of August, September, October, and November. The line was finally disconnected in November due to nonpayment. When I spoke to a representative to inquire about the charges and who was responsible. He stated that the system noted a “future cancellation” I had to record this for my documentation. I did not ask for a future cancellation. I asked that the lines be canceled as of 9/23.Now, the bill has went to collections with inaccurate data. Not only has T-Mobile incompetency ruined my business credit it has also forced me to pay an inaccurate bill which has been paid in full. If you’re considering T-Mobile as your phone carrier…. RUN!!!!!! pay a little more to have a peace of mind, exceptional customer service, and a technical/help support team.I’ve been contacting T-Mobile since September it is NOW March and this issue has not been resolved. T-Mobile you can’t go around robbing customers without a gun. I’ve been a loyal customer for many years however, I’d never ever recommend your services nor will T-Mobile ever be my phone carrier again!",0
"I am so thoroughly disappointed in T-Mobile right now. I used to be a proud T-Mobile customer and have even referred people to them in the past, but my experiences with them of late have been downright inane.I've paid the same balance with them three times: they didn't apply my first payment (even though it showed up in my bank account) so they sent me to collections; when I tried clear up the issue, I ended up paying the amount again. Then T-Mobile sent me to collections AGAIN and when I tried to prove once more that this was paid, the debt collector sided with T-Mobile and I ended up paying again.NOW, T-Mobile has sent me to a debt collector for the same balance AGAIN! And because I don't have my six digit code (on an account that's been closed for two years) T-Mobile can't help me over the phone. So, to get this thing cleared up AGAIN I have to go into a store - where the wait can be anywhere up to an hour or more - in order to get this thing resolved. I am not paying this for a fourth time and it irritates me that this keeps happening.I will not be referring people to T-Mobile anymore nor will I be a customer of theirs again.",0
"Today March 15,2024  (1:00 pm ) I visit with my daughter the  T-Mobile location located beside Walmart on Madison St in Clarksville TN (new store). When we go inside the location no customers and 3 employees sitting look out there phones. We don’t receive any greetings and no employees names. My daughter was interesting in a few lines for herself and family but the feedback and info was horrible. This guy ( long hair white young with no name) was no professional and he don’t have the purpose to sell phones or give any information to customers. The service was awful and bad. We going to another company that treat us with good customer service and good options or plans with our needs. That kind of service in unacceptable and I don’t understand this company hire employees like this.",0
"Awful service in geral it is not 1 star is 0 stars.I am Portuguese from Portugal but due to my work I was living in the USA, I decided to buy an iPhone and since I could do it by finance I decided to buy it in T-mobile I always pay everything on time by almost the end I came to Portugal I still owed three hundred and something dollars to finish the whole thing so I decided to pay the whole thing and close the account because in Portugal I am not going to use a t-mobile card I am using a Portuguese card I should mention I pay more for my phone to be unlock so I can use any mobile service. So I pay the rest and try to use a Portuguese card and it doesn’t work the phone is not unlock so I contact T-Mobile cuz they can fix this online. Well no help they say they can find my process it is like the account never existed I explain that I close it that I am overseas. They never find it, I don’t wanna deal with them anymore so I just pay to get my phone unlock, 60 euros.They by the end cant finish the process to unlock my phone because T- mobile says that I owe 668 $. And I don’t, probably the new owner of the card owes that.And when I try to ask for help the excuse is always that they can’t find my account.So right now I have a iPhone 13 Pro Max that I can’t use because is blocked.",0
The worst costumer service. After 17 years I am changing provider. T Mobile lies and charge so much more. The worst ever!!!,0
"If I could review T mobile, I would give them -10. They have very, very terrible service, and for almost two years, they have promised to fix the problem that they promised to us, but when you talk to them, they start over and again and promise and promise, and nothing happens. So for those wanting to find a good service, think about getting t-mobile so that you will headaches what we have experienced.",0
"They really don’t deserve any stars because they will continue to raise your bill each month and then when you leave them they will charge you ridiculous fees on your final bill that just continues to grow higher! Was on the phone for an hour trying to resolve the final bill and they would not even try to work it out so I just didn’t pay anything and will go to court and tell how they ripping customers off. Make a wise decision and don’t give them your business. There service sucks, AT&T service and coverage is much better!!!",0
Extremely rude customer service. I was forced to go to them after being with sprint for ten years and they merged to T-Mobile. They won’t work with you at all. My bill is always way higher than it’s supposed to be and what it was agreed upon. My bill goes up hundreds of dollars randomly. Awful company. I’m looking into changing asap.,0
"These guys are just charging late fees. There is no good connection anywhere.  From when they have taken over The supervisor Andrew operating as he said from Oregon should not be put in front of clientsHe should be given a salary and a desk jobHe is  hostile, not concerned about customer relations at all",0
"Hello my name is Kenneth . I have been a customer for 11yrs. Since October of 2023 I have been having a problem with Assurant and the Tmobile Customer Service. I have been lied to on numerous time. I originally purchased a Samsung S20fe from the store in Woodbridge, VA. The phone has been exchanged out several time. The software had issues (ContinouslyBuffing), screen blacked out, and  when finally came around to the fifth time. The store ordered an replacement.  Got a text from Assurant  that the phone was on backorder and dont know when they would have one . I called and talked to your customer service about the issue. The representative told me to go to the store and get a replacement for free. Also, to give them the Samsung S20fe that had issues.I got the Samsung S23+ for my mother. I drove 150 miles to get the transaction done sine i work in Delaware and it was my day off. I paid the activation fee and was there for 4hours in the store. I was under the understanding that they were I was gonna owe $279 for new phone and accessories. Now told that the phone was $900 plus and they tried to add a new line on my account without my authorization. This transaction was noted on the account. Plus, that replacement never arrived.Now let's get to the New phone I bought in Newark,  DE. I bought this phone in November of 2023 while I was getting my car worked on. I had been waiting awhile to get a new one. So while I had time to burn as the car was getting worked on at the dealership. I paid the activation fee and get the accessories to protect the phone.was happy to get my new phone of Samsung Ultra 23.  On December 21. The phone fell when getting out my work truck. The Otterbox case cracked the back of phone and it shut off. I went back to the store and see what could be done. I had the phone for 21 days. They told me they couldn't help me and I had to go through Assurant. Funny thing is I'm 150 miles home from and my mother was having surgery on December 26, 2023. I got to a computer to start the claim and then it got complicated.  I texted the representative Chad K. He told I could go to Christiana Mall to get get replaced. Got up early  on December 22, 2023 and was at the mall at by 10:30am. They told me they couldn't help me. So, they let me use there phone in the store to start the claim. When it got to the payment status of the claim they hung up on me. I called the Customer Service at T-mobile to get them involved. I know Christmas was on December 25th and the phone wasn't gonna arrive until December 26th. I told them I wasn't gonna be home to receive it and gave them the address of the store in Newark, DE. When I went to pick the phone up @ 5:30pm. I was told that they couldn't accept the phone and sent it back to Assurant.  I called Usps and Assurant to see who had the phone. No one knew. I called Tmobile back and told them I needed the phone tonight or tomorrow December 27th for work. Assurant ad Tmobile promised the phone work arrive on that day. Long be hold it didn't arrive and more excuses were made. I was told by the representative to get another phone and I would have to pay for the old one.  The replacement didnt arrive until December 31, 2023 from Fedex. A neighbor found the package sitting outside and picked it up. I called several times after that with problems. They tried to add another number. To be frank and the point.  I was being billed for 4 lines and 4 protection plans. I have been fighting this matter since then. Tonight I went the store to get them to send the phone back to Assurant as told by the representative.  On January 21,Christina said, they would ship it back to them. The Store Representative open the bag and found that the phone was to be sent back Usps. The phone was never used and still in the security tape. Now, I was told by you Tmobile representative that you want me to pay for the old phone along with the new one. I understand one, but 2 no way.",0
"T-Mobile has no competent person to contact if you have any problems with billing (lots) and their changes to business plans.The local T-Mobile offices are not allowed to handle billing/plan changes by TM only the “61” number in the Philippines.You can’t understand the “61” staff and they don’t understand English and our bills keep on going up and up.Our monthly plan should have been about $150 month but because of “61” it is now $344.On of the ladies in our Tempe TM office has a black eye from an irate customer over continued months of excess charges.We finally had to cancel because no one in the USA can help us.We began service with Verizon 1-29-24 for $150.Verizon told us T-Mobile can’t continue billing us after their service was discontinued 1-29-24 but TM did.We received a FINAL Bill in January 2024, which we paid, but new bills keep arriving incl 3-8-24.If T-Mobile just paid their staff a decent wage, the managers could handle billing and plan complaints.The Philippine people are probably paid $2 an hour so they are  angry and revengeful.Just take a fraction on the millions spent in advertising and compensate your American workers to handle disputes.There are over 8 websites with negative reviews regarding T-Mobile  incl the Better Business Bureau.Praying BBB will help us because our only option is to stop paying them and wreck our perfect credit.",0
"Cut the cord and went with T-Mobile wireless in the home. Turns out they use ip address that do not show actual location.   Subscriptions don't work such as MLB.com Fubo Hulu etc. Sports games and networks.We live in Seattle and the news and channels are all Fresno Ca. When we google something like pizza or whatever near us, It only shows business's in Fresno Ca 850 miles away. T-Mobile customer service told us they would try to fix it and call us back Monday. Never called, I google it and they already have thousands of complaints in many forums.",0
we been with them 12 yrs dont join them all types of bs...phones go down no discount....hulu app established before tmobile gave it to yu free added their code it wipe my whole app...and offerd me another free trial...They ass...stay away...yu will have a headache...if they dont have a attitude with yu they wont help...but they get on the phone as smartass... I'm pretty sure I'm done with this phone company customer service used to be helpful they offer you stuff and then take it away I have the screenshot proof it's time to find a new phone company T-Mobile's not it anymore,0
I have been a t-mobile phone customer for 24 yr.  In the past year 4X my password was changed on my account without my authorization.  After the fact I received an email and a text saying that the change was made and if I didn't make the change I should call.  When I call they say that this is not possible and don't even seem to try to be concerned.Worse yet on one of the 4 occasions when the password was changed someone paid my bill using  info on file 4 days ahead of the scheduled autopay date.  Tmobile did see that this happened as online payments are coded differently than autopayments.  To me this would appear that someone may have testing the system.  However tmobile would only repeat that this will never happen again and I should not be worried.,0
"I am so glad I left this crappy phone carrier but now they apparently added me as an authorized user to mothers account even tho she did not authorize this and neither did I. So who did? They can’t tell me. They want me to verify and pass security but some random stranger who didn’t verify was able to add me as an authorized user without either of our permission. I hope this company burns to the ground, they are such a headache",0
I talked to a person about upgrading mine and my wife's phone and looked into iPhone and was told would have to pay 0 for 2 new iPhones and then i asked about doing one android and was told would have to pay 170.00 something for taxes on a new android phone so hung up and talked to my wife about the increase to the bill for 50.00 for iPhone 14s and 60.00 for iPhone 15s and wife said let's go with the 2 newest iPhones. So called back about 10min later and wanted to get the 2 new iPhone 15's and was told i would have to pay 230.00 something for the taxes i told that person hell no i want what i was told on the previous call and she messaged the first girl i talked to to call me back and she said that the 2nd person was right that i had to pay the taxes but i told her she told me for the iPhones would pay 0 and only would pay if i decided to get android and argued with her that she told me i would pay 0 and she needed to honor what she told me and she said that the system must of messed up and she couldn't honor what she said earlier so i asked for her manager and as soon as he got on the phone he was rude and i argued with him some too and told him i know you recorded all your calls so listen to the call and he said no that no matter what that uncle sam wants his money and that was that. He said he could give me the president of T-Mobiles info and take it up with him but it won't change anything I would still have to pay. I then told him ok fine he's going to lose a customer that's been with them for over 12 years and I'm going to get the rest of my family and friends that have T-Mobile to leave as well and i all ready just in one day got 32 family and friends leaving T-Mobile and going to Verizon with me for lying to me and not giving me what i was told i was going to get. All this will also be posted all over social media and all platforms to the way you all are at T-Mobile telling people one thing one moment and the turn around 10min later telling them something totally different and not wanting to honor what was said the first time. Hope you enjoy losing a-lot of customers for the stupid things you do to your customers and they just take it and not fight back but I'm done taking your bs anymore and this wasn't the first time this has happened to me in the time i was with T-Mobile that was told one thing and then something totally different later and don't want to rectify the issues and just have us all eat it and take it . No more will i take it. I hope a-lot more people see this and step up and fight back as well.Good day a long lived client for 12 years is now gone.,0
"I switched from Verizon to TMOBILE and it has been one of the biggest mistakes I have made.I'm not going into details because it would a novella. All I have to say is that this company could care less about their customers. They screw up and want you to fix it.I'm going to see how complicated it is to go back to Verizon.  I never thought I would say a more expensive bill is worth it, but here I am",0
"Awful customer service. Customer service reps don't know current promotions and are only able to follow a script. Hours of my life I won't get back, and several hundred dollars wasted, due to their lack of timely response or my frustration of having to waste additional hours with little likelihood of resolving my concerns. They then referenced fine print to charge me an additional month of service for five lines, when only one line was active for a single day...The horror stories about their customer service are true!!! Consumers beware!They have lost a reliable customer for life - no more T-Mobile for me.",0
"DO NOT GET TMOBILE PHONE OR INTERNET!  Customer service is horrible, they transfer you to one department, that department then transfers you back cause they say that you should not have been transfered in the first place. The rebates they offer are a scam. They have you jump through hoops to get it yet you still don't receive it. The customer care supervisors (Cliff) lie to you even though everything is recorded. Then they try to blame another company (amazon) until you tell and send them the email from amazon stating they have absolutely nothing to do with said promotion. Stay far away from this company, unless you like wasting time talking to them only to get nothing accomplished!",0
"I switched my phones in October 2023 and they offered me  a new plan (expensive of course) promising pay more on trade in, however they didn't gave the the credits yet.

"I have 4 lines withT-Mobile last year and I was paying $132.00 dollars. In Dec 23. we decided that it was a time to buy 2 new phones, which we did.  I trade in my I phone, but my husband could not because it was broken.  They gave me a $1000.00 for my phone and have to paya 799.00 for my husbands.  So we were expected to pay $35.00 extra for 24 months.  Remember I was paying $132.00 a month for 4 lines, but at that time I did canceled 1 line because we did not needed it anymore So now I only have 3 lines, the guy at the store told me that I would only have to pay for the the telephones and that my monthly payments were going to be 167.99. Which we agreed to it.  But when January came my bill was 232.+, no where near what the guy told me. So I called T Mobile, waited about an hour in the phone for an answer and finally when I got the person on line she was rude, no help at all, and she told me that that was what I signed for and was stuck with it whether I liked it or not.  My opinion about T-mobile, they tell you one thing at the store to get your business, but the reality is another,  and that is how T.Monile fraud their customers out of their money.  This is the way this organization works because the same thing happened to me two years ago. So please be in the look out for this T-Mobile organization because there is never an special with them, they will lure in with this promotions that don't work and you get stuck with a big bill. Their customer service is not good and on top of it they work from some where in Lala land and sometimes you don't understand what they said.",0
"I am writing this letter of complaint because of the unsatisfactory customer service treatment that I received at your store located at 3204 Pennsylvania Avenue SE. I visited the store on Saturday March 2, 2024 and spoke with one of the store representatives. I explained to her that my phone was not working, it had been not holding a charge and finally, went all the way down. She checked the phone and confirmed that the phone was not functioning. She prompted me to make a claim and provided me with a phone to call the claims Department. I proceeded accordingly, and the claim was approved with a $49.00 deductible paid.  My wife opted to have the phone sent to the store for pick-up. I was informed that the phone had arrived at the store and proceeded to pick the phone up at around 10:45 AM on Monday March 4, 2024. The store representative asked a few questions regarding my claim, which I thought was odd, since I had already been through that process. The store representatives requested my identification to verify my identification. After a while, she told me that she couldn’t scan the phone into the system, only the manger had the credentials to take such actions. Therefore, I returned home and went back to the store around 12:35 PM. I was told that the manager had not arrived and was told to return around 2:30. I asked if a regional manger can perform the activity necessary for me to retrieve my phone. I was told no; only the store manger could perform this activity. I waited approximately 35 additional minutes for the store manager to arrive. When I returned to the store, there was a waiting period and then additional questions were asked by the store representative. After a while, the store representative told me that the claim was denied. I was very perplexed because the claim had already been approved. Therefore, I requested to contact the claims department to ascertain what had transpired between my claim being approved to the store denying my claim. The T-Mobile claim representative spoke with the manger, Abdul, because she said that the claim had been approved. After a few more moments, the store representative began to asked additional questions and requested my identification again, now I am not only perplexed, confused but also annoyed. Finally, Abdul informed me that the claim had been denied and proceeded to cancel the order.I am thankful that the customer service department responded by re-ordering the phone and refund my deductible. However, I remain concern regarding this unsatisfactory level of customer service, since this is the T-Mobile store that is closest to my house. I am hoping that this issue is corrected, that I may not experience such horrible services the next time I visit this location.Feel free to contact me should you need to discuss this matter.",0
"We canceled our account and 3 lines (one of which was never in use by us or anyone else) and T Mobile continued to charge us. When I called to complain they refused to refund us. I’ve since had to file fraud with my bank, and will be pursuing legal action. Long story short, unless you want horrible service and to pay for something you no longer use, avoid T Mobile.",0
"After being a customer for many years with this company, they simply do not care. I’ve been paying off a barely working IPhone for 4 years. I have to pay 99.00 to trade it in for the same obsolete model despite signing up for their buy one get one free plan years ago. Due to the fact we’ve upgraded - that was cancelled. Obviously, most people want to upgrade.The company preys on people’s desire to be trendy and in. They prey on their misfortune, and their absentminded selves. They bought Metro PCS so nope, cannot go there and pay less, they bought Sprint, so now cannot go there and not deal with these crazy corporate games since they are TMobile now.We need phones because it’s 2024 sadly. So we put up with it. They know this.There are never any offers local to people in the Northeast for the T-Mobile Tuesdays hardly. There are definitely no offers for loyal customers. No discounts nothing. You want that fancy new phone? You’ll have to pay for it for 4 years in small payments and it’s a never ending high bill.I’ve had to replace my daughters phone about 7 times and pay a fee every time of a whopping 99.00. The Assurian insurance is terrible. If T mobile is such a big company, why not just walk in the store, pay the deductible and exchange phones there if we are to pay the high price? Twice Assurian claimed they lost the old phones we sent in-  threatening to charge us for not sending in the (very broken phones) only for many calls later to have “found” them once shown proof of tracking. It’s truly corporate greed and being treated like a number at its finest.I’ve been told “if we do this for one person we’d have to do it for everyone!”The reason for my final upset - I’ve fallen on hard times these last few months and cannot pay my insanely expensive bill. Our phones will be shut off because they want to argue with me over the fact I cannot pay the last two bills and they will get their money eventually. They are a multibillion dollar company. They make you promise to pay on a Sunday so if you get any money on Friday then it won’t be in that day. You don’t realise this. They do though.They also won’t let a relative or friend pay in the store either or let you pay with an expired ID as I don’t have money to get a new one yet.I’m a responsible person. I had a job. I ended up working for a company who replaced a higher up with a very unprofessional individual to put it nicely - and I left for my safety. I have not been able to get a job since. I’ve been living on savings and some I will get back soon. T mobile cannot wait??? I have proof of this. They are a very wealthy company.This never has happened we have always paid. So clearly something personal is going on. They do not care. They should really have honoured their buy one get one on the phones too but that is not happening either because my daughter wanted to upgrade.So that’s my experience with T-Mobile and that is what happens when a company becomes a monopoly. Thank you.",0
"RUN FROM THEM!This company is a thief!  We cancelled our service and they tried to say it was cancelled 9 days after billing cycle started.  This is a lie.  Also, we were getting Paramount Plus through TMobile.  They were double billing this and would not correct!  So well after cancellation they took the full month payment automatically (the second we cancelled service they cancelled our entire account so we were unable to cancel autopay).  They are refusing to refund our money or guarantee no further charges even though account is cancelled.",0
"Where do I start?My wifi has been down for three days and counting, which is also how long I have tried unsuccessfully to reach someone who can help. Oh yeah, they also have me locked out of my system, and I can get no help with that either. Chat says they need to access my account and apparently they cannot help. Voice line says there's a wait, but they never call back when you request it. I am DONE.",0
T-mobile telephone customer service is extremely frustrating! The agents are often difficult to understand and they have to keep putting you on hold. I was on the phone for over an hour and a half with waiting and being put on hold numerous times. I hope to NEVER have to call them again!!!,0
"Stay away run, run, run!! When 1st signed up promotion $750 off per phone (2 phones) savings $1500 after 7 months l I paid phones off in full. I bought 2 new phones they gave me trade in value and I paid cash for these and ths promotional discount. I stayed another 4 months until sneaky price increase so I switched providers. Following month received bill almost $500 I blew a gasket. What happens those so called ""PROMOTIONS"" are only if you stay with them for 24 months (it's in the fine print). If you get $1000 off per phone don't stay 24 months you pay that    BACK!!!  LONG STORY SHORT.....BEWARE OF TMOBILES PROMOTIONS and other fees I don't even want to type out.",0
They are cheating with Customer and direct pay charging more and stelling my money from my bank account. When called Customer service call goes some other country and with poor English and hard to communicate,0
"The company does not value its customers as they claim. They treated me like crap after been with them for over a decade. The insurance company they use (Assurant) is equally a fraud. They claimed not to receive my old damaged cell phone I sent back to them during a claim. They were charging me $1,100 for the no-good cell phone. Is this how phone and insurance companies suppose to conduct business with their loyal customer? I am going to file against them and switch carrier.",0
"Over-the phone internet T-Mobile rates change within the hour!I telephoned the Pembroke Pines/I-75 store, and Ernesto told me that the internet rate would be $50. I went into the store, filled in all the paperwork, had a soft credit check, lifted my credit freeze on 3 credit bureaus, and then Ernesto announced that “Oh, they just changed the rate a few days ago. The rate is $65.”I wasted 1 hour because of Ernesto’s lie! If you have an hour to waste, telephone T-Mobil, listen to a non-existent rate, then go into the store, and you’ll hear the real rate—which will be higher than the one he quoted.He also told me that I could have a 2-week trial period. But that was over the over-the-telephone rate. Maybe it will be a 2-day trial period if I go into the store. Who knows?Welcome to T-Mobil—where you get a low internet price over the phone, but by the time to get INTO the store, you get the higher price!The store was empty. I should have known. Everyone is smart enough to stay away from Ernesto’s lies. You have been warned!",0
Scammed by Tmobile. They don't honor their promos or their trade in offers then they charge to call customer service where they make false promises and never fix problems.,0
"If could give no start, I would. The worst service, worst coverage. I would never come back to them, and wont' recommend anyone.",0
"I travel a lot so I signed up for their new plan that includes Wi-Fi on domestic flights. They made it sound super easy.  Connect to airplane mode, plane WiFi and then make a WiFi call and you will be connected but of course normal misinformation from T-mobiles.A lot  of flights don’t turn on WiFi until in the air and it’s too late.   T-mobile never comes thru and sells you services that don’t work.",0
Tmobile is absolute garbage. Overcharged the shtt out of us. Then promised to correct the bill over a month ago. Never corrected it. I've contacted customer service dozens of times and had repeated promises that it would be corrected. Last night they said not to worry and our service would not be interupted since I have said I am not paying the bill until it is correct. This morning our service was disconnected and even more additional fees added for the service disconnect. They asked me to pay the full amount to restore service now. This has been the worst service I've dealt with from any cell service. Complete bullshtt.,0
"Returned a watch. They kept charging on the line. when we caught on we had already payed for that line a total of $225. they denied it was returned. They refused refund and if the line gets cancelled, they will cancel the rebate and we would have to pay $93 remaining on the watch.",0
"TLDR: They took money after a free trial and getting it back is a nightmare.Signed up to test T-Mobile home internet service with two weeks trial period. Service seemed fine for what it was, but I got a better price from the service provider I already had, so I canceled with T-Mobile. Store couldn't cancel service, so I had to call. Customer service has been kind every time, but they are useless. I was charged for a month of service ($55) after I had canceled on time and returned all equipment. Upon calling for reimbursement I received $40.21, not the full repayment. That was two weeks ago and the process is on-going. I'm still owed the small amount and it's barely worth the repeated calls and confusion from service reps. I'm no legal expert, but if this is happening on a large scale it seems criminal to me. Promised free trial and they took the money anyway, making it painful to get full refund. If this is happening as a result of their ""system"" it looks like fraud to me, taking money from people with already tight budgets who need cheap internet when they promise a free trial. Won't use them again.",0
T mobile lies to its customers- sells u one deal at one rate & when ur bill comes it's substantially higher. This has happened once to me & once to my mother-in-law. How they get away w this is disgusting. They make u think it's ur ineptitude in understanding the billDISGUSTING....no it's not & hope they get sued over & over. Disgusting ppl running the company. May they rot!!!!,0
I have insurance on screen protector...went to store on davis...no one would wait on me...helped people who came in after me... was there for over 1.5 hourdcalled another store...no one would answer...called 611...they can't help me since I'm on my moms plan...and she wasn't at my house to talk to agent...and I thought vetizon was bad...guess I will have to go back to them...this is unacceptable,0
"T Mobile is overhyped and overrated.   I switched from Verizon due to cost & customer service. T Mobile customer service is second to none.  That's where it ends.  The T Mobile service doesn't live up to its hype.  I drop calls like itthe 80's and service is none existent in many stores or buildings. When my 2 years are up, I will return to Verizon.",0
Don’t go to the Miller Lane (Butler Township Ohio) store. They are thief’s. They stole my two phones I turned in and now am getting charged 2000. I have the boxes and serial numbers and now must contact the Ohio Attorney General today after they said the employees working there were all fired. They’ve been running us around for several months with excuses and say they are fixing but never do anything. They will be getting a call this week from a Consumer Complaint Specialist from the Attorney General’s office.,0
They suck. Updated to T Life so customers can't access T Mobile Tuesday's offers & suck us into buying new expensive phones to bow down to them.  Bad enough they don't take auto bill on credit cards anymore. They're making BILLIONS & screwing customers again.  And the service is crap.,0
very bad exprience with T-mobile today..After being with t-mobile for over 15 years customer service was no help at all..I have always paid for insurance for my Samsung Galaxy phone warranty and since Assurance didnt have it in stock they made me take a very inferior phone called WingTech which gets horrible reviews…Regardless that i pay for a warrenty for Samsung they force you to take it or leave it…I will be looking into other carriers now and leaving T-mobile as soon as possible,0
"As a long-standing T-Mobile customer subscribed to the Magenta® Amplified plan with three voice lines, my experience with the company has been consistently positive without any notable issues. However, on January 15, 2024, we initiated contact with T-Mobile to help us navigate plans and get the best deal possible at that time.  To stay on the current plan and purchase all new phones and increase our monthly bill from $ 157 to $270 or switch to a more expensive plan and get promotions. We opted to switch to the Go5G Next plan, which involved trading in three devices: upgrading from an iPhone 12 to an iPhone 15 Pro and obtaining one complimentary iPhone 15 due to adding a line. During this process, 2 different T-Mobile representatives assured us that, after factoring in all eligible discounts, including a teacher discount, our monthly bill would total $230. The process included 3 steps including changing the plan which is only possible by phone service. We trusted representatives to do it correctly, but unfortunately, it was not the case. The wrong code was applied to one of the lines, the other code was expired and had no value.Despite receiving three new iPhone 15 Pros and one iPhone 15 on January 17, our account still reflected details from the previous Magenta plan. It was only last week that T-Mobile finally updated our account to the Go5G Next plan, resulting in a monthly bill exceeding $349. It feels that we are trapped because according to the agreement we only have 20 days to make changes, but our account information was not updated till it was too late. Until that time (February 6) we were sure that our bill would be $230, not $349 like it is stated now.Upon noticing this discrepancy, I promptly contacted T-Mobile to seek a resolution. Despite investing significant time on the phone with various representatives, the issue with our bill persisted unresolved. I hate to be trapped: phones we used for trade-in cannot be returned to us, and codes for the trade-in are incorrect. The customer service department wasted hours on “investigation’ to come up with “Unfortunately we cannot fix the problem as all those deals are expired now.",0
They have lied to me about my bill and credit.  They want to charge me 60 over quoted rates. All I hear is how no one can do anything g and they will charge me an early termination.,0
"2 years in a row we signed up for monthly internet service during a lengthy stay over holidays. No problem the first year. The second year they continued to charge us and when I called to straighten it out was told only the account holder can cancel. This was not the case the previous year, nor were we told this when we signed up and took the equipment or when we returned it. And it is nowhere in their paperwork. Customer service just says, ""I'm sorry"" or ""I understand"" or blah, blah, blah. I'm pretty sure the supervisor is just the robot at the next desk. So literally, any authorized user can add lines and services because that makes T-mobile money. But when it comes to canceling services and therefore reducing the monthly intake on their end, it takes the account holder. Unethical much? And when I complained that my son (not an authorized user) was able to walk into a T-Mobile store and get a brand new I-Phone, she suggested I go to the store (where he was attending college?!! ) and take it up with the manager. Again with the customer service script that says, ""That shouldn't have happened."" Forget reading small print, it isn't there.",0
"Left T-Mobile due to poor service and dead spots.  Went to local store where they told me I was paid in full.  Received a bill a week later AND a call from a collection company.  Fought this collection. Weeks later I receive a FINAL bill from T-Mobile.  I pay it.  Today I receive a REVISED FINAL bill for $107.00, finally with an explanation of charges. This is four months after I was told I was paid in full. Worst.",0

"The actual speed is too low.We buy this Net service from t-mobile since it offers $10.00 off (the full NET service total becomes $40.00)1. The average speed measured is usually less than 25 Mbit (less than a quarter of the lowest standard 100Mbit/s speed).2. Customer Tech Support Never has a real solution. All solution available is to turn off the power of the Router box. Within 8-days, we made at least 4 calls, but the only real solution is ""to turn it off about 5 minutes then turn it on again"".3. Lie in explaining reason: within 4 calls we reach, the only explanation is ""I saw the technical is working  ... It only takes 1-2 days"". But actually, it is either a lie or they work with the turtle speed. After many days the problem was still not resolved.",0
T-Mobile is refusing to honor their Phone insurance policy with me. Instead they want me to buy a new phone. This is INSURANCE AND CONSUMER FRAUDThey want me to pay $1400 for a new phone when I pay $18 a month to cover my phone. THIS IS THE BIGGEST SCAM EVER.. What a joke they are as a company. I really think they are doing this because I am a senior,0
I purchased international data plan at $30 for two phones to travel for ten days and was unable to use any of the 5 gbs on one phone. Whenever I tried to access internet it wouldn’t let me and times out.  I called T mobile and went through automated service only for it to say to call back during business hours. I called when I got back to get refund and they treated me like I was a liar even though the phone showed that 0 out of 5gbs were used. I tried reaching out to managers and they were even worse. I escalated to another manager above two and that person never called back. I have been loyal and never asked for anything from this company but when you sell me a product that doesn’t work and then treat me like dirt for $30 when I pay $230+ per month it is unforgivable. They wanted to refund me half saying it was my fault that I didn’t constantly reach out to them while overseas and figure out when they were open to help me. Huh! They said that the phone was used because it stated for one day out of ten 0.004 kb were used and that the phone was used on the day I left and was still in the U.S. Despicable! Others have complained about bad service and I will make sure that friends who are chief officers at major companies spread the word. And you will lose a bunch of customers for $15!,0
I wish I would have read these reviews before switching to this $#!t show company. I had to pay $800 to sign up.  I went from Verizon and having internet at work most of the night to this joke of a place having internet 1 hour maybe a night.  Hopefully it's not a run around to get my money back.  2 days of this bs company is more than enough for me. I spoke to customer service 4 times in the last 2 days.  They were also less than useless because none of them speak English.  They mute the phone over and over and try saying the same stupid thing that don't work.  This company is a joke!!! I would rather have no phone than have this trash company for free!,0
"I've been with T Mobile for YEARS! I wasn't even able to do a simple stupid trade in without having to pay money monthly because I was ""grandfathered in on an old plan"".TMobile??

"I had a business account with T-Mobile, with 10 phone lines and a couple of other devices. They guaranteed me credits of $600 per line to switch over to them. Once I switched, they said that I didn’t qualify for those credits and only got $150 per line. My first invoice was incorrectly $1500. In calling them, they said that was a mistake, and I should only pay what I owed, which was about $500. I did that, but two weeks later, they shut off my lines and charge me to turn them back on. They did this four subsequent times over three months. I finally had to transfer out. They are now invoicing me for over $1000 for a phone they say I purchased from them that I had originally bought from Verizon and ported in when I first transferred to them. This company is an absolute train wreck, I have spent countless hours working on it to get resolved. I even come lost a few clients because they could not reach me. They keep telling me they will have someone call me back to me, but they never do. They have now sent my bill for a phone that I owned before I came to them, to collections. Absolutely corrupt!",0

"Mada a huge mistake moving from ATT. From day 1 not happy with how my porting started and the false promotion they promised.My honest recommendation to AT T users please do not switch from ATT, if your are switching please don't come to TMobile because of the below reasons.1. Poor network coverage. They say we support wifi calling , when you are at work you don't have a wifi network and my office is in NYC and I have only 1 point signal. I never had this issue with ATT2. promotions what ever they have won't continue even for a week. The promotions whatever they offered me during the sales got expired before I activated all my numbers. I had to wait couple of days to get my phone unlocked from  ATT by then they said your promotions is expired and I am no more eligible for the promotional offer signed up. More over the promotions is eligible only if we activate all number in your account I order to get all lines.3. We are 5 in the plan the promotions said free phones on all lines when we added free phones we neee asked to pay  800 for the 5th and said this gets credited month on month. Which was not explained by the sales person in the store. We have 5 lines what will the other members think about me when I say this offer no more exists. I am adding them to my line by saying the promotional benefits. What kind trust will I have.my name gets spoiled because of this4. Porting and activation my line was not activated for 24 hrs after porting happened. I did not realize the phone wasn't activated until next day. I had to call them to activate Mt number wherein I had to wait 40 mins on call to get connectedOverall I'm with wrong hands and no more I will refer or recommend my friends and family to T mobile.  After 2 yrs I will switch back to ATT.",0
"I have had the service for a year and 4 months and it the service center that is in the Philippines is the most atrocious comments said to customers I have ever heard and if you complain you they put you on hold,  Comments that have been said to me include, go get a cup of coffee and get a cookie, to just begin with.  They have been charging me for tablets that I do not have every month and I have to be on the phone for 1-2 hours every billing cycle.  I know their prices are good but the customer service is enough to make you insane.",0
"Review of T MobileI ordered T Mobile Wireless Internet. I never received the proper equipment for internet and was charged $112 for a service i did not receive. I returned something i did receive to the store, and they told me it was not the proper equipment for internet. I asked for a refund and they said i had to call a number to do it. I asked can't they do it there? They said no. I called the number and said i didn't receive the proper equipment. They said that means i can get a refund. Then they quizzed me and asked for a 6 digit pin #. I said i don't remember any pin #. Nobody can remember a six digit pin #. They said i had to go to the store to get the refund. I said I was just at the store and they said to call this number. They said that is the only way. I went to the website and tried to log in and it didn't recognize me. Then i went to the store and explained the situation fully. The store clerk asked if i wanted to pay the amount. I said no, i want it cleared out, i was told that they could do that here. She said that she would not service me and asked me to leave!this was 4714 N Broadway, Chicago IL 60640 at 1pm Sunday Feb 4 2024I said i would file a dispute with the credit bureau and this is what i intend to do.

I recently got home internet and they don't even know how to apply my acp benefit which I'm approved for and transfer me to other companies that have absolutely nothing to do with anything. Their website says they accept the acp benefit and I follow the steps to apply it on my online account yet it just logs me out and I cant do anything.

"Stay away! I had tmobile for almost 10 years. At first they were good, over time the service (phone) has been awful for me everywhere. I even had to call multiple times to see what was going on. Was super patient, even tried out their internet. Which sucked in my area and I had to cancel it within 4 months. Anyways the service never improved so I finally left them! And ever since they’ve been treating me bad, I’ve called to pay off my remaining bill and no one helps me. Tried the chat same thing. I received a bill by mail that told me to pay online as a guest and their system won’t let me either. Overall bad phone and internet service and unfortunately bad customer service!! which is why they lost a great client with meCome to find out that they charged my card without my permission for the remaining balance on the phone and the $1 bill owed them for service. Horrible company! I’m appalled, this is illegal",0
"First off, was lied to about a promo deal. The guy who opened our account in the store said the promo came with 2 phones, 2 tablets and a galaxy watch absolutely free. Told him we didnt want the tablets or watch and he said the price  was barely lower without so we should take the promo.  He drew out a plan and said our total amount was $206 including taxes and that would never increase. Realized when we got home that we were charged to activate the tablets and watch. We knew we were paying phone activation fees but were never explained to that we had to pay activation fees for the 3 items we didnt even want to begin with. Tried to take the tablets and watch back the next day and same guy was there, along with the manager who was very unfriendly and unapologetic, and was told we can return them but need to pay a restocking fee and also our promo deal would not be valid anymore and the price would go up so it was in our best interest to keep the devices we didnt want. So we did. Few days later, the bill on my account was $251 so we called customer service.  She didnt know why it was that amount.  Then my husband put in for the first responder discount and auto pay discount and she said the bill would lower to $135 within 1 to 3 days. It did not. Called CS again and the girl said the first responder discount went through and now our bill would be $224 monthly. Asked to talk to manager because the price was higher than we were quoted...and come to find out , phones werent free. We have to pay monthly for them. And the tablets and watch services are also  not included in that ""promo"" price we were quoted. He said we had to go back to the store if  we wanted to return the devices and would be charged those restock fees but we would qualify for a better discount. So all in all, we will have paid close to $200 in activation and restocking fees for 3 devices we clearly told the 1st guy we didnt want. We will have nothing to show for it but wasted time, aggravation,  and $200 wasted as well. Once our contract is up, we will be leaving tmobile for good and i would NEVER recommend anyone go there, especially the lanoka harbor nj store. No one is held accountable for giving us false info, or straight out lies even. Talked to 3 reps on the phone, one a manager, and 3 reps in store, also including one manager. Every representative had a different answer to give and gives you the run around on who to talk to so you go in circles calling CS and going back to the store. They are a disgusting company with incompetant liars for employees!Edit: just went to the corporate store in toms river nj and the employees and manager were very helpful, and apologetic for what happened in the other store. They got us on the plan we originally wanted and did their best to refund what they could. I recommend going to that store if any one ever wants to deal with t mobile",0
"honestly criminal, I got a phone at the store which had many issues that they replaced. however, they didnt have the replacement in stock, they ordered one. It didnt show for two weeks and i couldnt continue to have a phone that worked 50% of the time. I went back in and the store gave me the next best one for no upcharge. HERE IS WHERE THINGS WENT WRONG. new person, did the activation under a ""Lease"" even though i paid for the phone in full originally. They were not able to back up the error because the IMEI and other numbers were already in the system because of the activation. After HOURS they gave me a credit for the ""lease"" on my account. fast forward until now, lease is up and they are asking me if i want to KEEP my phone or RETURN it. well its mine, i paid in full. i called in to tell them this and they argued, told me i was wrong, they said i got the upgraded phone and its worth more so NOW i need to pay for it. total joke, scam, and should be illegal.",0

"I've been T-Mobile for about 2 years. I had an interest in upgrading my phone so, I did my homework, decided on a phone and began the omupgrade on the T-Mobile websiteThe figures provided were fine however, when you get to the consent page (to agree to the figures) everything changes to higher monthly payment amounts, your trade-in value is nowhere to be found etc.....I previously thought T-Mobile was a halfway decent carrier but, they're nothing but corrupt, unethical scumbags.Some Pinhead rep told me their ""system"" wasn't functioning properly and he then quoted me the price I originally saw. Too late! They lost my trust. Time to move on to another carrier.....",0
"Will continue to give bad reviews until coverage service improves again. Decade ago, used to be good then they absorbed sprint. Now emails come thru in big blocks rather than as they should one at a time and emails don't go thru and I constantly have to resend.",0
"After 3 wonderful years I just had the most disappointing conversations with T-Mobile. What's changed??  My services were suspended with no advance notice, with no messages, no communication whatsoever. The reason, I'm told, is because there was one missing payment. Meantime T-Mobile has not 1 but 2 valid forms of payment and I have never missed any previous payments. After spending crazy time on the phone trying to understand and rectify the issue I was then told different answers by different supervisors. The last crazy conversation was about a $15 credit I should have received and was not provided. Enough is enough. Good by T-mobile until you return what you used to be.",0
"Worst customer service! They had a problem with our internet, it took from 1/9/24 until today 1/26/24 to finally get service. It took a change of a modem and we were supposed to make another trip to get a second modem today but there is a snowstorm so we didn’t go. During the last hour, service magically came back on. We spoke to them as we have many, many times this month and they would not give us a refund on this month’s bill. So instead of 300 gb, we were only able to use 23 gb, but they still wanted full payment! After my husband spoke with them, they gave us $40 off our bill and told us it was the best their manager could allow because they didn’t know if we would use a thousand gb tonight! So $93.57 for this month of 23gb. Terrible customer service! We are looking to switch.",0
"Worst ever, employees do a ripoff not explaining none of their offers or details of their packages. Got a prepaid card, payed 3 months in advance to keep the line active, cause I’ll be out of the US (no one told me I won’t be able to receive SMS nor calls and the line will be dead), so those 3 months in advance payment is wasted as the line is inactive but payed for. When I called them, they told me to upgrade to 40$ plan to just be able to receive SMS to the line, and calls if any. I told them I just need the line active, and I payed in advance cause T-Mobile guess what - receiving payments from cards issued only from certain countries and my home country isn’t the one. I told them, I’m outside of the US, payed in advance to have the line active - none informed me of additional minimum charge for prepaid roaming, and I can’t upgrade my plan as the card I have isn’t from one of 15 countries which is accepted. Money wasted time wasted stress from dealing with thiefs. Zero zero zero stars, do not get anything from this ripoff and their uninterested staff - worst experience in Seattle and Chicago! Philippinos on the call center are friendly, however talking much and zero helpful as their company is - zero.",0
Was contacted by a T mobile business rep. Said they could lower our bill. Instead they open 3 accounts and triple billed us. Called customer service repeatedly but tge barely English speaking reps couldn’t help because there business rep. opened accounts. The internet barely worked. Horrible company. I left for Verizon and never got our money back.,0
"I have been with tmoble for ever. I just bought a new phone, and be honest, I wish I had my old one. Not only was it expensive, it is terrible. Talking on phone I hear echo, on speaker, they hear ehcos. Always kicking me off of internet, pictures are terrible. I can't afford a new phone, but seriously thinking of moving on to new company to get one.",0
"The only way to improve this company is to shut it down. They charge for items they say are a gift for loyal customers ( you discover it later on your bill). They steal items you trade in, and then the customer service simply doesn't consider your complaints anymore. They are overpriced. What else? Sometimes you find a competent associate, but it's pure chance.",0
"I have been a T-Mobile customer for over 10 years, but my experience has been far from satisfactory. Living in a densely populated area, I expected reliable cell coverage. However, T-Mobile's service was so inadequate that they had to provide an amplifier to boost the signal. It was one (two, actually) more devices running in our house, but it solved the issue.Fast forward to when I decided to cancel my service due to moving abroad. To my astonishment, T-Mobile charged me $300 for the amplifier they provided 8 years ago - a piece of equipment that is practically obsolete and that they sold to customers for only $100 back in 2019.Attempting to resolve this issue, I spent several hours with their customer service. While the representatives were friendly, it felt like they weren't really listening (I had to repeat some basic facts several times). They never truly addressed my concerns.Needless to say that I'll never be a customer again.",0
"T-mobile contacted me about their 5G home internet service. The t-mobile rep offered me one price, but when the bill arrived it was over 50% more. I called and was told that offer had expired, and they would not honor the price. But I never asked for it. It was T-Mobile who made the offer. I am a current t-mobile customer and have been for years. Now how can I trust an offer or anything that I'm told going forward. Too bad!",0
T-Mobile encouraged me to buy a SIM card they knew wouldn’t work for my phone. Now I’m out 50 dollars and a terrible customer service experience.,0
"My husband and I have used Sprint/TMobile for several years and have had HORRIBLE experiences with them. We’ve tolerated questionable billing practices, bad customer service, inept management, spotty coverage, lousy promotional offers, outright lies about pricing and contract terms, impenetrable website login pages, inestimable wastes of time with general problem resolution, and terrible equipment- related issue resolution. I know mergers are never seamless but this irredeemable mess of a company needs to close down. We can’t wait for our new phone company to take over our account. Run as fast and as far as you can from Sprint/T Mobile if you value your sanity and money.",0
I have T-Mobile internet and phones They sent me a lap top thru the mail which I told them I did not want numerous times and sent it anyhow. They will not take it back and now they’re charging me for it. They lied about taking it back so now I am stuck with it They told me to sell it . But it only works on t mobile so I am stuck with this useless laptop. I ll be looking for a new service,0
Worse people to deal withManagers a d supervisors will not talk to. Customers and no help puts you on hold than transfers you to another useless rep.I will never recommend any one to them,0
"Absolutely the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Contract was a bait and switch, with false representation of what was included, the ""guaranteed"" monthly cost, etc. The store said to contact corporate, and corporate said it was the store's responsibility to make things right. Stay away from ALL elements of T-Mobile!",0
"Promises were made by one of their phone ""Advisors"" and broken as soon as we got of the phoneIn my case and my opinion I would say shady business practices.",0
"I have a One Plus 8 phone that I bought from One Plus directly that is locked by T-Mobile. At the time, my carrier used T-Mobile lines so it wasn't a problem. After countless efforts to get T-Mobile to network unlock The phone, I was told that I would need to purchase a prepaid card from them so they could access the phone. Then after having it for about a month and a half, I called again to have it unlocked. Custom Service is clueless! Apparently they don't keep any records of previous phone calls and I have to go through the whole issue again just to have them tell me there's nothing they can do. Finally after at least three supervisor calls, I get one by the name of Alex who convinced me that he had taken care of the situation and my phone would be unlocked in 24-48 hours. He said I would get an email. It's now a week later and my phone is still locked, no email has come, and I am forced to call them again. This time I get Becky. Becky tells me there is no record of my phone calls with Alex or anyone. Funny she did give me a call reference number though. Becky tells me I have to do a factory reset to unlock it. I'm not seeing that this will work either. I will update if it does, but at this point, I have at least 15 hours of talk time to customer service in which ten of those were on hold. I still am not able to use my phone with my regular carrier. Don't ever get T-Mobile! They are terrible! They hire people that you can't understand and it doesn't matter because they don't know what they are doing anyway. I think I may have to complain to the FCC. T-Mobile has no right to keep my phone locked. Thanks for nothing Alex!",0
"T-mobile is the most deceptive, Greedy, and scammers that I have fully experienced with this company stole money three times from my account without having my permission  I'm not happy with the service and the company which I believe is a crooked establishment",0
"After being with a competitive Telephone Carrier for decades, I decided their fees were too high, and decided to save money by going with T-Mobile and their advertised rates.HUGE MISTAKE.Signed up, and spent THREE (3) days trying to get both of my lines working.  NOTHING worked correctly.  THREE (3) days of wasted time.  They couldn't get both lines connected, service quality was worse than poor, and their agents were totally clueless.I then cancelled service, switched to a new Carrier and WHOA  !!!!  everything immediately worked perfectly. BUT !!!   T-Mobile wasn't finished. They had me set up in 'auto-pay' and thus began a multi-month disaster of trying to get them to remove incorrect charges.  HOURS spent on the phone, talking with agents who promised to transfer me to their Supervisor, but who instead switched me back into the general call incoming 'pool'  wherein I had to Start ALL-OVER-AGAIN with a new agent, describing the issues, and trying to find an iota of justice.   More DAYS spent trying to get rid of these bottom feeding losers.  BUT, it's even WORSE !!! They automatically put my account into 'COLLECTIONS and then more clueless scammers calling, trying to collect monies on a NON-EXISTING account.STAY AWAY from these low life brain dead liars, and scum.  They cheat, steal, and scam the innocent public.    OTHER carriers are FAR more professional and courteous.  T-Mobile will NEVER achieve even a minimal level of professionalism.Please NO DOT blame me when you get 'burned' by these low life scum.",0
"After 6 weeks of frustrating, fruitless calls to T-Mobile customer service I finally walked into the T-Mobile store in person -- after my third visit to the store, a rep was present who had my problem solved in about 15 minutes. I had spent approximately 15 hours over 6 weeks of calling T-Mobile customer service and spoke to so many different reps, supervisors, technical engineers, etc., and none of them could find a solution. Many of them promised to call me back with a solution, and none of them followed through on the promise, and many of them failed to even call me back at all. The DIGITS app was not working dependably--I was continually not receiving all texts. I used DIGITS for my business line and I wanted to keep my business number on my same phone. Why did it take so long for a T-Mobile rep to suggest adding a second line to my phone??? It seems like a simple answer. I wasted a lot of time before finally having my issue solved.",0
"Horrible service at TMobile! I’ve been a loyal customer for 25 years. I get ooor reception on the lines, overcharging of my bills, and poor explanation of service and benefits. This company needs an overhaul!!! No one can answer a strait question! I don’t recommend them!",0
I am not a customer of T-Mobile but am receiving nuisance calls from their call centre on average 3-4 times per week. I have repeatedly asked them to take my number off the list & stop calling me but yet the issue persists for over a year. My number is registered with tps so who knows how they got it. Awful. I am sick of the stress & interruptions.,0
"1 star because 0 wasn't an option.  T-Mobile raised my rates so I decided to switch to another carrier.  They canceled my service but kept auto-billing me.  I was on the phone with customer service for hours, completely useless and unhelpful.",0
My husband changed his cell and our home to t mobile. Thank heavens I kept my phone with Verizon. They cut service off before the due date. He is constantly getting his service interrupted. He has made like 5 payments in two months and pays whatever they tell him to pay but our service is interrupted every other week and it's frustrating spending hours on my Verizon cell phone calling T-Mobile to figure out what on earth has happened and if they can get it turned back on. They usually want another payment. I've never seen a company act like this ever. It's insanity. My husband is returning his phone tomorrow and disconnecting his service.  He has promised not to change our home wifi again.,0
"I thought I would save money by using T-Mobile and I did. However, I dropped an average of three calls per day for the ten months I had this service. They could not offer me any better service so I canceled.Then, after canceling, I was late on my final payment. After they did receive the payment a month late, they billed me late charges and sent me to a collection agency. I received both bills in the same week.Terrible service and terrible billing procedures. So glad I went back to my old carrier.",0
"I don’t want to sound like I'm exaggerating and writing with a lot of emotions after multiple times trying to get their support. I want to ensure that they have been by far the worst customer service I have experience with all the mobile service companies. If you look forward to have good customer service and have a company that ensures they improve on this, T-Mobile is not the one. Also depending on the area that you live the cell reception is very poor. I recommend to ensure that fits but the customer service is the worst of all companies. Hopefully they improve that soon and don’t keep losing their customers.",0
No customer service online only a virtual robot,0
"I've been with T-Mobile for quite a few years, but sadly, the customer service is severely gone downhilli’ve done many upgrades in the past with no problems in mailing back the trade-in devicewhere my problem comes this time I didA upgrade last November to a very expensive phone got the phone no problem activatedIt mailed back my trade-in phone tracked it. It shows received first part of December where the problem lies I had paperwork showing I was supposed to get $585 for that phone I have never received the promised credit to my account I have now had 12 phone calls to T-Mobile telling me to keep waiting they showed the phone has been received, but it may take a while to get the credit last phone call now is telling me to wait two more bill cycles BS!!I have done a lot of upgrades. It does not take two months to get your credit. I used to work in a large wireless call center. I know how it works and this is nothing but BS that they are feeding me.I have called multiple times asking for a manager only to be told one is not available or one would call me back, but they never doI am severely close to just paying off my phones and taking my lines to another carrier. Only problem is I live in an area where I’m really limited on cell phone carriers as cell reception. Here is not great unfortunatelyall I can say is save yourself, major major grief. If you decide to do an upgrade, go to a store, never do one through the mail, or be prepared to eat the money you were promised better yet stay the hell away fromt-Mobile",0
What a very sore company I tell them I had covid and that I won't have no money until the 19th and that my account will go negative if they take it out and what do they do still take it out and they said that they would help me but yet they still took it out I will be changing carriers once this is done and over!!!!,0

My wife signed up for a T-mobile account for her new iPhone. The account was almost immediately hacked. My wife went to China to care for her mother. Then she discovered her T-mobile account was hacked. The thieves were able to completely take over the phone number. All sms verifications went to the the thieves. They were then able to hack all her bank accounts. They even extended the limit on her credit cards and drained them. We were trying to close the T-mobile account the whole time. T-mobile refused to close the account and every time my wife tried to create a new bank account the thieves used the T-mobile account to take over the new bank account. T-mobile refused all assistance. Now my wife is stuck in China with no way to dispute the charges made in her name or even create a new bank or credit card. T-mobile has allowed my wife to remain powerless in China and will not allow me to close the account either.,0
"THE WORST CELLPHONE COMPANY!!!!I HATE T-MOBILE!!!!!!!!!!!I REPEAT I HATE T-MOBILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This company suckers people with contracts. I was told by 7 different  representative different prices of my phone. I was sucker by a white female  My phone was stolen and T-mobile insisted on telling me I was under contract. This means I am responsible for a stolen phone that I will never see again. 2 representative/employees; a rude black female with an attitude named Tiss and a white smart mouth male supervisor name Jason that lives in Charleston South Carolina, insisted on threatened me in to pay as if I still had the phone. I had to pay for Price of phone, accessories, data plan, cords, and screen protect and insurance, even though I don't have the iPhone 14. My account had a 360 insurance, in case the phone is lost or stolen. I was charged for a stolen iPhone 14 pro max. This company didn't care that my phone was stolen or tried to give me another phone. They only care about getting money. NO STARS!!!! SEVERAL HANDS DOWN WORST CELL PHONE COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!",0

"I have been trying to deal with adding lines as well as a change in ownership of 3 current lines- been a customer for 7 years- the customer service is HORRIFIC.  Sure, they are polite and read their scripted cues beautifully, but they have ZERO idea what they're actually doing and I've gotten incorrect information over and over and over again..... I've spent 30+ hours on hold, talking with a rep, or chatting online to try and get things resolved.

"To start with, if I could give a negative number I would. Today 1/1/2024 my son was trying to switch carriers as he was on our account. When he received the SIM card, we found out his phone was locked, because we owed a $1.32. This was an unknown balance to my husband and I. The $1.32 was sent to collections. My husband and I cancelled our service on 12/5/2023. We switched to PureTalk. My phone ended up being locked as well. My husband took my phone into a T-MOBILE store and was unlocked with no mention of a balance owed and in collections this was on 12/7/2023. We've been on off the phone with T-Mobile Customer Care Services off and on since 4pm (1/1/2024) We have spoken to2 different operators on currently on hold for a third who is Supervisor #2...We were previously told that since we cancelled our service before we had a credit of $92.00, again no mention of $1.32 that was owed. Mind you our bill was due by the 9th of each month, so technically our bill was not due until 1/9/2024, if would have stayed with them.  Since, we cancelled 12/5/2023 there should not be bill owed...now it's in collections not even a month later...Way to T-Mobile, you rock and still on the phone at 11:33 at note with no resolution. My husband is going to the Cooperate office tomorrow...",0
"I was a T Mobile customer for nearly 10 years.  Over that period, their customer service has gone downhill.  Hold times to reach customer service are now 30 minutes to an hour.On December 26, 2023 at 12:31pm, I called T Mobile to protest an increase due to their declining my autopay discount; they wanted banking account & routing info, which I was not willing to provide.  I was on hold for over 30 minutes.  They subjected the on-hold caller to music and a recorded voice cut in every minute, saying ""we'll be right with you"" and sometimes asked you to ""name that tune"".  During the long wait and bot cut-ins, I wondered ""why are we being treating so poorly!?""I decided I'd had enough and cancelled my T Mobile service on 12/26/23.  It turned out to be the worst customer experience I have ever had.  Our two Iphones had a T Mobile SIM/Carrier lock.  I could not begin service with the new carrier until the phones were unlocked. I spoke with a T Mobile tech on 12/26/23 and requested the SIM unlock for the two devices.The next day, 12/27/23, the phones remained locked, so I drove to my local T Mobile store, and the employees were unable to help.  They said I had to work with T Mobile's Customer Care group (via phone).It ultimately took almost 25 hours and about 3.5 hours on the phone with various T Mobile people (plus two more charges on my credit card) for T Mobile to finally unlock the phones.  It was a version of “kick the can”:  one rep told me I needed to do a factory reset on my phone to unlock it.  She transferred me to an Apple Care tech, who advised me that T Mobile needed to unlock the phone and that a factory reset would NOT unlock it.In the last call, I was on the phone with a T Mobile tech for well over two hours to get the phones unlocked.    Before I could get the phones unlocked, they asked me about returning equipment I had already returned (a signal booster which didn't work, and that they failed to support, I had returned it months earlier) and about paying them for an Iphone we had paid for in cash months earlier.This was just an awful experience.",0

"My experience with T Mobile the worst company that I have dealt with in my 76 years. I went.to the Mechanicsville Va store and got the internet gateway to try for 15 daysI could not get a good signal to far from tower. I took it back 4 days later and was told we won't take it back and to drive another 30 minutes to another store where they took it back. That's only the beginning I started getting charged 55.00A month for 2 months on credit card.I called and they said they would take care of it. I called again two weeks later and they said it would be taken care ofI called again and sorry.it would be taken care of and today I get a collections notice for 110.00I called again and asked to speak to manage and got no satisfaction. I just filed a complaint with the Attorney General Office ,BBB and FCC to have this removed from my credit report.

I received a email from Marty ceo of the response team telling I returned the equipment on 11/16/23 and not on 10/16/23 and he would offer to erase the 95.33 if The claim was over. I sent the receipt for the return showing 10/16  now that's  the ceo of the response team can't even get it right.

I have been with t mobile for over 6 years now and slowly they are showing their true face. For the past 3 months i have been really patient. I wanted to upgrade my paid off iphone to their latest version and they sent me the wrong phone and had to send me a new order. Now they have messed up my account and I owe double what I used to. My new monthly bill now is $750 which is ridiculous. I have been on the phone with them every other day and they keep promising we will get to the bottom of this but they never do. They have now suspended my line for the 4th time because I was promised a call and resolution from some of their supervisors who completely ghosted me as this seems to be a more complicated situation. I rely on t mobile for my business and they have not held their end.,0
"I was with Sprint for a long time, they switched to TMobile. While I was with Sprint I fully paid off every phone I had and always did the trade in to upgrade.

I would have just sold them on my own. I lost $400, please learn from my mistake.",0
"I used to get good service from T-Mobile, but now it's terrible and I plan to switch companies. I hope I can find a better company.

"I don't see any use for the T-mobile store in the Westfield Oakridge Mall. The manager of the store - Eduardo has no powers and they don't honor anything that the T-mobile app online offers. All the sales folks have parroted 'only eligible if you upgrade your plans to 5gGoplus plan'. There was a time when they'd invite and go the distance to retain customer satisfaction but now with their domination in the market, all of them display 'arrogance' - the manager in particular. Is there a way to notify T-mobile upper management to reconsider either removing the manager or empowering the stores to honor online offer or remove the store completely?",0
"I chose the 55+ plan since it allowed two lines, one for me and one for my out-of-town college kid.  I was using a Droid and moved over to the iPhone 11.  Then T-Mobile “upgraded” the antenna my phone was using to connect to.  Weeks of trouble started and when CS ran a “diagnostic” on my connection, it blew out my Cisco WiFi router.  They gave me “generous” $75 to replace it.  No way!  Cisco didn’t sell $100 devices then.  I was told by CSRs that management was considering replacing my phone with a 12.  Right, in a pig’s eye!  I had to buy it and the improvement was minimal.Calls to customer service went to through to nauseatingly polite representatives, or once in a while people who really didn’t want to work. The big red check is a no go from the start and all the smaller guys are subcontracted to the “big boys” in the market place and offer contracts of dubious, IMHO, value to the customer.So, as soon as junior finishes his studies, I will return to a flip-phone or no mobile phone.Experience, what you get immediately AFTER you need it.",0

"Call the 611 because my account was frozen.  Phone tech could not get into my billing. Made payment . Had payment plan $64 on the 21st and $64 on the first of January. Well T-Mobile locked it down because I haven't made the January 1 2024 payment....it's December 21st ....so i had to pay the Jan 1st bill on the 21st just to be able to get my other phone activated.The attitude of customer service was good at first till I stood my ground so I put it on speaker phone. Every one in the electronics section heard her crappy attitude asking me ""why am I still waiting on you"" ...get rid of horrible bs loopholes and sell the company to Temu!!!!!!¡",0
"There is a reason why they don't ever document any conversations or the trade in value of the phone you just gave them.  I was told $1000 for the trade in value, then I sent in my phone, I never got the $1000, I got partial credit like $440, I called them a dozen times about this, each time I was told different BS or excuses, 6 months later I am still calling about the correct trade in value, this time they said my original promotion had expired at the time I sent in my phone.  I've had enough with them.  Every time (after at least 1 hour) of talking to them and getting them to agree it's $1000, I ask for an email or some kind of written documentation to say what they agreed on, they dodge this request and refuse to document this trade in value.  I've had at least 3 supervisors giving me their verbal ""personal guarantee"" that I will get my $1000 and 6 billing cycles later, I am still not getting it.  They really try to scam you in any way possible and hoping customers won't notice the little charges here and there, or hoping that we would just give up because no one has the tenacity of calling them over and over and spending tons of hours and mental stress dealing with them.",0
"If I could give them a 0 I would. Worst company every. First they lied to us when we started a plan with them. We were told that we were getting a phone for free which was a complete lie.

Now I want to downgrade my service on their prepaid number they are giving me the ran around again saying my account is suspended. I told them I don't have an account with them the number is prepaid.

"Hello, after finding out the router I originally bought from T-Mobile needed an upgrade I thought that this would be an easy transition to a new upgraded one.

Not sure if they were not configuring the router on purpose at the store because. Or again they just didn't know what they were doing. And this is after speaking with the manager and the rep. After the 3rd router, I was still unable to configure the router to log in. So I went back to the store to get a replacement the manager and rep started arguing with me because the court information wasn't on the router. Sand the manager stated after this router is replaced I cannot come back to this store if something goes wrong with the router. But it was their fault I had to go through so many routers before. So after replacing this router, I needed to make sure this router was up and running before I left the store while I was video on my phone this whole incident. This rep thought I didn't see him on his cell taking a screenshot of all the router information IMEI, router password, etc. So immediately after I left the store I called T-Mobile to tell them what had happened so this could be recorded. To me, the rep didn't sound too interested in this incident and was more concerned with a second line and another new phone. And now after putting in the ""new router"" overnight it reset itself and now I have had to reconfigure this router 3 times because it keeps getting hacked and I know it's because of the manager and rep at that store.  Wow... Store# 9062. I think they should retrain their management and staff because whatever they doing is not working. I'm in contact with a lawyer. This doesn't make any sense. I hope this doesn't happen to other customers at other stores like this happen to at this one.I will be posting my experience with the store and Tmobile everywhere. This is crazy!!!",0
"I have been a customer for at least 25 years. And have always been happy with them until yesterday. I went in to buy my granddaughter a phone which I raise. And noticed tax was way higher than it should of been, So I questioned it. They said its a one time activation fee of 35 added. I said since when! This is my phone number that I've had for years and we are switching the sim card over. And so the argument began. I will also mention I haven't worked in months because I've been busy fighting cancer. So I had to get in my bill money and take out the other money. This is nonsense. My husband and I both need new phones too. But they just lost two sales. I am going back to buying off of market place or Craigslist. Very very disappointed in this practice that started last year. And the lady waiting on me said it's always been that way! Wrong! I said I can't wait to get my survey when I leave the store. And for the first time ever they did not send me one.",0
"I was with Verizon for 22 years.When I saw the Ad. On tv about TMobil offer iPhone free for each line and their rates I called TMobil spoke to a sales representative (every thing was recorded by T Mobil) I told her I want to switch 5 lines from Verizon to T Mobil.She said we are eligeable for 5 iPhone 14 free.I told her I just want one iPhone 14Pro Max and one IPhone 14 Pro and I am not taking all iPhone 14 in that case TMobil saving lots of money but Insted 5 iPhone 14 free I want 1 iPhone 14 Pro Max free,and 1 iPhone 14 Pro free.I advised her to talk to her supervisor and if TMobil agrees to my deal I will switch.After 1/2 hours of explanation she agreed that I do not hand to pay any thing for iPhone 14 Pro Max and 7 $ a month for 24 months for I phone 14 pro.I agreed. Now T Mobil is keep charging money for both phone.I called T Mobil back many times but things are not redolved",0
"Staff told us in person, we would not have any extra charges for our cruise trip to Bahamans, Jamaica, Haiti, with our Unlimited plan.  However, when we got a couple hundred $$$ bill they would not issue a credit to cover their employee's miss information. After speaking with C.S. and the manager James Soriano they opted to not honor their employee's word.This is rough as we are forced to use this company due to coverage for home use.  Its also painful to hear the staff and management ask us to call other people to fix this issue and all we got was another person passing the blame with no good results.Furthermore, each time I've walked in, staff was too busy to acknowledge me even if I was the only one in the store. Yesterday I had to watch Neisha walk around for 10 mins before she helped me and I felt like it was a problem that I was there.The issue here is their word is not been good with us now on 2 different occasions.It's not about the money here. Its about the lies and wasting other peoples time. Belmont NC store",0
worst customer service ever. the guy on the other end of the phone is barely understandable. and all they do is dance around your issues with non-helpful questions and bs.,0
"I would not ever recommend going to T mobile!! The customer service is the worst of the worst and nobody will do anything to help resolve issues. I purchased a phone on 25Nov, received notification from UPS that my package was lost I was told that I should be refunded by the 6th, that didn't happen, I was then told I would receive my refund by the 14th, that didn't happen and am now being told it's not going to be resolved until the 29th. There is clearly a lack of communication in this organization and the fact it's taking over a month to fulfill or refund orders is horrible. I will be switching to AT&T as soon as this order is refunded. Whenever that will be.",0
DO NOT DO IT! WORST COMPANY EVER. GOT THEIR WIFI UNDER THE 15 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE AND SENT THE EQUIPMENT BACK WITHIN 7 days and they sent me to collections for $112….Tried calling them and they said the 6 digit pin I gave them was incorrect and there’s nothing they can do for me. I even offered my Social Security number and they refused….,0
"I’ve had T-Mobile internet for less than a month. It has been down three times with no notice, even when it’s planned maintenance.This is 2023 T-Mobile, you should have;1 sent out notices2 have an automated line for outages because your outsource help is less than worthless.3 have number that will update on your outages.Knock knock, it’s almost 2024.",0
"switched from ATT.  From day 1, most calls get dropped and more than 50% of text messages won't go through.    After 12 FULL hours with Tmobile support, they could not figure out how to make their service work.   I then asked chatGPT and it said to check if I was using Google messages.  Sure enough, the employee at the store had installed and set that up as my text app WITHOUT my permission.   I deleted the Google message app and Text messaging is better, now at least 80%, but still some are being missed and/or delayed significantly.  We tested it is not location based.  Tried connecting at 5+ cell towers with 5 bars and still an issue.Switching back to ATT.",0
"Walked into T-mobile 1491 W Mason St, Green Bay, WI 54303 with a phone I bought offline ready to buy a plan and start service.  The two employees there never acknowledged me so I took a seat and waited for a half hour while the employees continued to pretend I didn't exist so I finally left.  The next day, my husband took the phone there and the same guy who was working yesterday claimed he couldn't hook this phone up with service, he was completely aloof and very unhelpful.  I took the phone to a different T-mobile store a few blocks away and they hooked it up, no problem.  That location is notoriously subpar and I wonder how it stays open with those kind of employees.",0
"signed up for home internet never worked properly. (spotty at best) Contacted them 4 separate times, no better. wanted to cancel had to complete billing cycle. charged for somthing that never worked as promised.",0
If I could leave a negative Zero rating for Tmobile I would. Customer service is horrible they have to be the most incompetent people I have EVER COME ACROSS Down to my most recent conversation with a manager named John!! If he is in charge I understand why they can get it right. I asked to cancel my service on November 26 its December 7th and my lines are still on. I advised sprint's service was crappy but customer service was so much better his response oh we won't do what you want no sir I want you to do what is right I work in a collection environment I don't believe that the customer is always right but I do stand on principles and excellent customer service and TMobile has NEITHER!! Do yourself a favor buy a phone LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE save yourself from the JOHN'S and Tmobile unfilled agreements!,0
"Went to T-Mobile store in Sept 2023. Brought my parents to my account and was given ""free"" phones, as a promotion.   Was told to verify with T-Mobile regarding billing.  When i did so in September,  I was told I would see the charge for the phone, but would also see a credit for that same amount.  So here it is December and I'm being billed for the phone with no credit.  Called T-Mobile.  The rep stated there was no promotion on ""their"" end, and there were no notes on my account regarding a call regarding a credit,  and they were sorry someone told me I would get a credit.  I asked who would review the recording of that previous conversation, I was told to go to the store (an hour away) to try and resolve my problem.",0
"On 12-06-23, my mother and I walked in to the T-mobile store located at 1491 W Mason St, Green Bay, WI 54303 to buy a phone and start a plan.  We walked in and we were never greeted at all, no ""hey"", no ""we'll be with you in a minute"", nothing.  We took a seat and waited for a half hour but were never even acknowledged in the least so finally, exasperated and a bit shocked, we got up and left.  Those two T-Mobile workers in there were the two most rude, unqualified airheads I've ever personally experienced in a retail setting.  Their customer service, or lack thereof, was horrible and virtually nonexistent.  Even a dog will come up and greet someone, these people could not have ignored us more.",0
IF THERE WAS A 0 START THATS WHAT I WOULD GIVE THEY ARE THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD,0
Horrible! Don’t get involved with these crooks. Signed up on a “promotion” to buy a phone for 400.00. I didn’t need 24 months to pay off 278.00. They said if I wanted to leave my phone would now cost me 800.00. These guys are thieves and thugs,0
They changed billing to paperless without letting customers know. Now it costs $1.99 to get a detailed bill in the mail! That's absolutely insane.,0
"if you travel abroad, be aware that you probably won’t get your voicemails. They will tell you all you have to do is dial 123 on the phone. However, halftime that does not go through. Sometimes it says your passcode is incorrect even though it is. Also, it will say that you have no voicemails and then as soon as you get back to the United States you have about eight some of them from over a week ago that we’re not showing up which, of course, is costing you business.   I can’t imagine it being too terribly difficult to get a voicemail system that also works in Europe or Asia. It just doesn’t seem hard to my imagination.",0
"T-Mobile literally stranded us abroad and proceeded to extort us and lie to us. We upgraded to iPhone15 Pro's and changed our plan with a salesperson in South Florida. We have a second line on our phones which we use when we are in second home in Ecuador. The salesperson said we would simply need to change to an esim to install it. We tried that, but the phones are locked, and T-Mobile does not do temporary unlocks for travel anymore. After calling and working through their process, Janica (a Supervisor), told us if we paid off the phones in full ($2k), she would get them unlocked for us. We did. Seventy-two hours later (the latest she said it would take), they are not unlocked. We cannot access our bank down here without secondary text message on our Ecuadorian line; we cannot access our healthcare plan or communicate with our physicians, etc. A new CS rep said she would put in a request and it would take 24-72 hours more.  Still not done-- T-Mobile's service is reprehensible.",0
Tried to order watches for Christmas gifts for my kids. Took 5 sales people and 1 managers and they still got the order wrong. When I called t mobile in Wyandotte I was told for me to just go online and order the bands myself or call the number they can’t help me. I’m talking being on hold trying to place the order for over 10hrs total and the order comes wrong. Now after sitting on hold asking for new bands to be sent to me for two hours. I’m waiting for a manager for another hour or two to try to correct the problem. ￼,0
"We upgraded our devices to the iPhone 15 Pro with dual e-sim slots and upgraded our service plans accordingly to Go5G Plus which would make is eligible for upgrades every 2 yrs and with the promo would pay off the phones over those 2 yrs. However, if you wanted to take advantage of the second e-sim slot e.g. for international travel to be able to use foreign networks for faster data and calls while abroad, you couldn’t. If you needed a second e-sim you have to have the phone paid outright AND the device must be used with T-mobile for at least 40 days according to T-mobile’s current policies. It’s not an issue if you added a second T-mobile line to the phone but good luck if you want to use it for travel outside Can or Mex. If you stick to the promo where T-mobile eventually pays off the cost of the phone over 2 years (via monthly credits), you would never be able to access the second e-sim unless you held on to your now 2yr old phone and chose not to upgrade. We have spent hours with customer service trying to explain our needs so that we can use the second e-sim slot: we paid off 2 iPhone 15s, we even said they could re-lock the phones after we added our foreign e-sim. Only under the threats of leaving T-mobile did we get contacts from higher level reps who have now promised us twice that they would unlock the phones. At the time of this review, we have still not gotten any results or updates within the timeframe of their “personal guarantees.” Meanwhile, we are living abroad with less than optimum T-mobile service (using their local partner network). Some local businesses and services we use here require a local number which we have (because we had local plans before we switched devices and plans) but can no longer use or access them since we can’t add the second e-sim.TLDR: International travelers beware. T-Mobile policies don’t make things easy. You can’t use the phone to its full potential. Customer service has not kept its promises.",0
I cancelled my service and have been waiting on a refund for 4 months. Each time I call I have to start from begining.,0
"I been with Tmobile for 21 years and now all of a sudden I'm having phone and billing issues,  I had the flip phone z4 or whatever an they said that I could trade it in for whatever phone I wanted,  I wanted the iPhone 15 of course they wouldn't have it until 3 months later so my ass got talked into the Samsung ultra 23. Had the phone now for a month and now it's a billing issue saying I couldn't trade the phone in due to I didn't pay the phone off,  a whole month, so the customer service representative saying I understand,  no the HELL YOU DON'T,  I wanted money taken off from buying a new phone. Tmobile SUCK ASS yes I'm mad",0
"I've been with Sprint for 11 years.  I have a business account with T Mobile and was expecting a smooth transition. however, I've only experienced horror. One of my phone lines returned in July a phone because of a warranty issue. sprint contacted T-Mobile to tell them that the phone was returned.  you would think that they would credit my account the $1,00+ fee. no way!!! they have disconnected my phone line over 16 times and threatened to permanently disconnect my phone because of a phone I no longer have.  after three supervisors and over 8 hours of customer service phone time there has been no resolution.  why is every time I call I have to retell my story from the beginning.  do they have notes are anything?  please give me my number so I can go to a real cell phone company.  I'm contemplating filing a lawsuit for lost revenue.",0
I went to T Mobile from a prepaid plan lol I repeat a prepaid plan. So after getting sold the brand spanking new Samsung s23 ultra for almost 2 grand. I started having issues not receiving my phone calls!!! My business is ran off my cell phone.  The technician at tmobile literally told me that the phone is junk. That every customer with the new s23s are all having these same issues!!!! GO TO VERIZON AND GET A GOOGLE PHONE OR A IPHONE. YOUR WELCOME.,0
"horrible. the manager refunds my account after I was told the money he refunded wouldn't be taken out. now they expect me to pay the money back for the money the manager refunded. they even told me to ask a family member to help me get the money, how rude is that. you really think they would have know not to tell a customer something like this. then after I told them I was leaving because they are horrible and help. they have the nerve to try and send a review on how my experience was. They need todo better with their customer service department.",0
Purchased a iPhone from them and they will not unlock my device have call them for the last 3 weeks they keep telling me it’s unlocked and it isn’t been without my phone for 3weeks,0
"Will never do business with t mobile again and will make sure everyone knows about our horrible experience. Not only was our coverage way worse than AT&T, but we also had a few customer services issues with them throughout our time. However, by far the worst was when we decided to leave them.Back story…when we decided to sign up with them they said “we’ll throw on a third line because there is a deal and it’s free anyways. You don’t ever have to use it but can if you decide down the line you’d like to” this was fine obviously. However when we cancelled we had forgotten about the third line and nobody mentioned it. The problem came when t mobile continued to charge us for our full bill…when we called they apologized and stated they would refund us. However the following month came around and we never received a refund and were charged AGAIN for a line we literally don’t even have active. Again we call and they apologized and finally refunded us the $280.This was until we were charged AGAIN…the people were never actually canceling the line. We went into the store and they now we’re saying we’d have to pay $140 for our “last month” again for a phone line we NEVER USED.We called again and nobody seems to want to resolve this despite telling us twice on the phone we would be refunded  and it was a mistake. To out of nowhere be like “you need to pay a last bill” after months of us contacting them is unacceptable.We will likely end up paying this bill for a phone line we never used.We absolutely without a doubt will never recommend t mobile to anyone and in fact we believe they will cheat you out of money anyway they can. Not worth it…definitely not worth it.",0
"I hate this company. I was not explained when I traded in my phone that I was agreeing to being stuck with the company for 24 months. The chat and phone agents are constantly giving misinformation. They have not been able to send me a copy of my contract they keep sending me a link that takes me to my profile dashboard. Their website sucks and their mobile app is even worse. A chat agent promised me that my phone was going to get unlocked in 72 hrs if I paid $142.94 because that is all that I owed on my device. 72 hrs later I called and they tell me the agent lied to me. They are applying a trade in promotion in 24 months for a trade in device they ALREADY RECEIVED! I am not sending them pieces of my trade in each month for 24 months. On top of that if I want out of the company they are asking me to pay over $400 dollars when I have already given them my previous device and got a credit for almost $800, I have been paying installments for many months and last Saturday a chat agent told me all I had to do was pay $142.94 if you all of that up it is $1001 for a phone that’s worth $1000 but because I want to leave the company because I hate it and I am unhappy they want to charge over $400 as punishment but they call it “promotion” for a device they already received. They shouldn’t force me to stay with them if I don’t want to. They also can’t give me a better price and I have been asking for months. I hate Tmobile and I will make sure I let every single person I talk to know about the horrible experience, how toxic they are forcing me to stay with them when I don’t want to, how much they’ve lied to me, how bad their website and mobile app is and how they want to steal money from me when I already paid my device in full. Even car loans allow you to pay your loan early. Tmobile would rather have a million unhappy customers against their will than let people leave the company without hating them. I HATE TMOBILE!",0
Worst provider. They cheat you on everything.They sell you stuff as free but you end up paying for them.,0
These incompetent morons are the worst. I've deactivated by account due to unacceptable service and they keep sending me final notice bills even tho I've been to a kiosk 3 times to verify that i don't owe a thing!I want to strangle the morons behind this annoying bs.Tired of wasting my free time dealing with these morons!,0
"After over 13 Years, NO ONE deserves this treatment. I asked for a more economical rate (July) they didn't provide a solution that could beat Xfinity mobile so I left. T-Mobile closed my access to my account immediately online. They began sending me bills and charged me from July, August, & September. I called to dispute charges stating that I wasn't a customer and wouldn't pay. The rep claimed they would cover to cost but I had to pay up until July-August; and all other charges would be dropped by T-mobile. I asked for written confirmation and didn't receive it. Fast forward to today, I have a new bill claiming $7.00 late fee for the remaining balance of over $120 which isn't included in the bill. Later, I receive a debt communication letter from a debt collector for the $120+ amount for a bill on November 9th. Now, how am I billed on November 9th and then sent to a debt collector within 2 weeks, I have no idea. I used to love them for the rates....but this has been a complete nightmare.....I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.",0

"T-Mobile, is a very shady place, been trying for over a month to get my refund, talked to about 10 customer service people and have been getting the run around, think twice before dealing with the clowns in customer service, I never been so pissed off, never would recommend these people to anyone ,Oct 4th and still no refund as of today Nov 18",0
Went to switch with them back in March. Same day I switched Verizon bought me back with a better deal and we canceled the plan.

Will never ever recommend them.,0
"Terrible costumer service!! Carlos is probably the worst t-Mobil representative to talk to. Very unprofessional, he was rude and he tried to make me feel stupid. Obviously he took it personal when I told him I had change all my lines to another company (I thought he was aware of) He, changed his mood immediately.                                 I, was calling because I supposed to have a refund. I switched to a dif company on November 8th and the cicle close the 18th. The payment it was automatic. The rep that help me to close my account (Juan, very nice guy) told me I will have a refund, but Carlos said I did not explain to them that I was closing the account, (it was obvious when they gave me the code to unlock the phones and switch companies) and  I will not receive a refund.

"When the iPhone 15 came out, T-Mobile gave a great offer. I was doubtful of their coverage in my area, and the salesperson told if there were any issues with coverage I could return the devices in 14 days totally free of charge. ""There will be no charges at all."" When the phone arrived, I could not even make a call from my home due to the bad signal. Made one call from outside to check and a few text messages (8 total in the USA), and used 36 MB of data to check the internet speed while outside. Found the signal was horrible in our area and returned all 3 devices! (Did not even open one packet). After a month and a half, I got a bill for $257.39. When called the support center at Phillipense, they told me I owed this bill and they could not do anything, as this is an automated bill. Spoke to the manager who said you have to pay or it will go to the collection agency. He also stated they cannot help with the bill as it is automated. I wondered why they have customer service for billing. Anyway, I paid the bill while with the manager who said the bill is only around $48 for 4-day charges for the lines they sent to test. I was using my Verizon phone all these times, glad I did not cancel it. After 4 days of paying the bill, got a letter from a collection agency telling me I owed T-Mobile $257.39. Can't believe this, as they never even sent me a first-time bill, and I had given my Credit for them to monthly charge me, which got canceled by them when they stopped my service. This was a horrible experience for me, and I would strongly suggest you keep away from testing their services, as they are going to charge you for the days. Don't believe the salesperson.",0

"Tmobile has one of the most disrespectful and incompetent employees, especially the call center located in India.  These individuals provide fake names, they love to hear themselves speak, lack listening and communication skills and have no customer service skills.  It appears that they use your call to practice their English.  The corporate office where one should be available to file a complaint, the representative transfers the call to a B.S. department, when you call back and request to speak to a supervisor, you are told that you are being reported for harassment and your call is blocked.  This is Tmobile mission statement- to provide disrespectful agents and a disservice, while you pay us.",0

"Back in about 2009 T-Mobile sold my personal information. As my contract was coming to an end I was contacted by phone by someone asking if I wanted to renew my contract. I went ahead assuming it was T-Mobile at the time, but it turned out to be '3' Mobile and I didn't realise they had sold my details until I read about it, and being naive about mobile phone companies, I thought that '3' were part of T-mobile. I only found out about the data being sold by reading about it in the papers at the time. Needless to say I haven't used T-mobile nor '3' mobile ever since. However, we are now in 2023 and I'm still receiving scam and spam emails from all the usual culprits at the rate of some 15-20 a day. It is so brazen that they always quote a reference number and guess what? It is is the last 9 digits of that original T-Mobile number I had so there is no escaping who is to blame. Beware they will sell your personal details! Also '3' Mobile need a mention too as they bought those stolen details, so don't trust them either. I've left this for so long but after all this time I've finally had enough and the fallout from a company that still drags on. Someone less aware will get stung no doubt further by the scam emails proliferation. I would have liked to have given no stars to both those companies",0
"Worst experience ever, they promised me 800$ in credit in an offer, then told me I didn’t qualified so all they would give was 400$ for my trade in, now that I want to pay whatever is left on my phone after a year they’re telling me my trade in was worth only 80$ bucks and the 320$ they “gave me” was the promotion which I wouldn’t qualified if I paid my phone before my 2 years contract, what a bullsh!t, they basically got my phone for free, worst scammers ever",0
"They lie!!! Said they have the best coverage. I can stand if front of my TV to hot spot and it still doesn't work. They slow down your data so you have to buy better and more expenses phone. I'm switching back to Walmart or the dollar store phone. They worked every where and all the time. Walmart has better plans and they worked everywhere. T mobile you suck big time and your over charged for service. They're so petty that they charged me accounts.20 cents and they can't tell me what's it for. If you take .20 cents from every costumer that works be almost  allot of money that they stole from us. They are so bad that I'm will to hurt my credit just to cancel. I hate this company and the people are dumb in the store. I should charge y'all the$5 dollars for convenience fee just to put up with your dumb asses. So no I highly recommend not to use t mobile here in Ada, server sucks here.",0
"I went to a local T mobile store after hours of useless conversations on the phone to eliminate my account (I have a new phone service) they charged my account after I dropped service with them. I wanted to be sure they could not asses my personal banking information.  Over the phone the agent told me to go to a physical store, show my license and then then could eliminate my account. I went to a location in Camillus NY (On West Genesee street) the manager refused to help me and told me he could not assist me.. the Manager was indifferent and extremely rude.. I did get resolution at the Costcos in Camillus location. but it took literally hours of calls and driving to two locations to get resolution. I will never do business with them again",0
T-Mobile like most other companies are using the OFFSHORE CALL CENTER REPRESENTATIVES. They are not trained and most unprofessional people on earth. They would misrepresent what you say and falsely claims and charge your credit cards for services you never received. I hope that the USA government sue all of these companies because we as customers are suffering….,0
Customer service was horrible.  My main screen went out and I followed the instructions for resets and even went to the store they recommended to run diagnostics on the phone which said the screen was defective.  I called back to get a replacement and the tech wanted me to to repeat everything again and go to a T mobile store.  The rep the day before said they would ship a new phone since I have insurance.Spent two hours on the phone. Very disappointed this was not resolved and will not be held hostage for two hours at a store like I was when I switched from ATT.  Buyer beware,0
"We had to cancel our t-mobile internet because the service was awful in our area. I was told I would get an email with a shipping label attached to return the router.  I received the email but with no shipping label attached. Tonight I spent two hours on hold and still don’t have an email with a shipping label. The last person that I spoke with told me I would have it within three hours. That was six hours ago, so I assume I won’t receive it. I believe this is t-mobile’s way of being able to charge the customer for non-returned equipment.  Long story short……buyer beware.",0
I would give them zero stars if I could. Switched 6 weeks ago and totally regret it. Customer service is not knowledgeable. You will spend hours on the phone with them and get a million different responses depending upon who you talk to. My account was never opened correctly. My employer discount would not be applied even though they said at the beginning it would. I will stay though my phone trade in credits then leave this horrendous company. Beware.,0
There customers service is the worst and they lie they told me my order was coming November 6th lied about that promised me a lot of stuff lied now I have to wait until November 8th which I won’t be home I hope my people at my house can sign for it if not I’m done with t mobile den they didn’t care they was going to send my phone back either way if I didn’t except it something needs to be done with this company,0
"I went to a T-mobile store in Bellevue PA and was promised one thing and then after I paid money, said that they wouldn't honor their offer and that I had to pay more after I confirmed the terms of the offer many times.  When I called T-mobile for help, they promised I would receive calls back from the store and from a supervisor but no calls ever came.  I called 4 times with the same promise each time. Every time I called, I got different information.  I am looking to move to a new carrier now.",0
"Just got a text, if the payment method is cc, you will jot get the auto payment discount. How low can this company go, just the greed at the C suite level is horrendous. They are not cheaper than anyone else, just a bad bad company.",0
"T-Mobile’s in-store customer service left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. I visited the store to replace my internet router, but the staff refused to help me, claiming that the router was defective and that replacing it would hurt their numbers. They told me I would have to go to corporate or mail it in and wait for it to be shipped. I explained that I needed internet right away and couldn’t be without it for several days, but they still refused to help. I have a business account with 12 lines, but they didn’t seem to care about my needs. The customer service specialist was rude and unhelpful, and I was left without internet for several days.I would not recommend this store to anyone. The in-store customer service is terrible, and the staff doesn’t seem to care about their customers’ needs. I plan to reach out to T-Mobile’s corporate team and management to file a complaint about this store and its poor customer service. I hope that T-Mobile will take steps to improve its in-store customer service so that other customers don’t have to go through the same frustrating experience that I did.",0
"Stay away from this company their billing practices boarder on criminal!  My closing date for my account was 10/11/23.  They charge ahead for their services so when I canceled on 10/12/23 I figured I would be refunded for all $60 - less 1 or 2 days.  Today I get another bill for $60(11/4/23)!  I called T-Mobile billing & was told ""yes bill is pay ahead.  Because I did not cancel before start of new cycle I am responsible for the full month""!!!  What type of customer service is this! Now I am paying double for my service, because new & better customer service company Consumer Cellular, charges after use!Again STAY AWAY FROM TMOBILE THEY ARE NOT A REPUTABLE COMPANY PUNISH YOU FOR DECONTINUING THEY PLANS!!!",0
"Don't go to tmobile, they are liars and don't know what information they are advertising!  I had an account with ATT for 10+ years and I was getting charged over $400/month for tv, internet, and phone.  I went up to midtown plaza to tmobile when the store was there to switch my provider.  Gabby, the store manager, assisted me.  She told me I could switch over to t-mobile for a lot cheaper for all services and I could trade my ATT phones and they would be all paid off, in full.  I had two phones from ATT, an iphone and an android that I traded in.  No further instruction was given, they said they would take care of it, and received a confirmation email of the same!  4 months later, I am getting a bill from ATT that I owe for the phones that were switched over, over $1000.00!  I kept calling Gabby and she kept saying she would look into it.  After several months, now I am in collections and my credit that I worked so hard to get back up, is ruined.  Apparently, Gabby, keep in mind she is a manager, had the wrong information.  Because I was on a payment plan, the phones were not eligible for this program!  Shouldn't a manger know this?  After all the back and forth, and finally finding this out, btw, noone knew this info up front, I attempted to call Gabby again, but this time, no response.  Why?  Because she was wrong, made a mistake and she couldn't fix it.  First of all, if you are a manager, you should know the policy and how the programs work.  Then, when you made the mistake, you fix it one way or another!  It didn't matter to her, she made her money and I am in collections ruining my good credit!  This shouldn't be allowed.  I was a nurse and if I gave someone the wrong info, guess what, people could lose their lives.  Obviously not the same thing, but the main point is, is that if you have a job, you do it, you do it well, you do it right or you get fired or you are screwing someone else's finances or lives or what not.  DO NOT go to tmobile, they dont have the correct information or everyone isn't on the same page!  All they care about is making their profit.  This shouldn't be allowed.  There is NO excuse!!!! A manager like this does not deserve to be a manager!  I will be cancelling my account, they don't even care to lose a customer.  Oh well, maybe that's why the store that I originally went to closed, they SUCK.  Have all the information, paperwork, etc you need when you open account with anyone.  Because when you get screwed in the end, you better have your ducks in a row because they change up their story to cover their asses.  I know she will get this review and I hope her manager fires her for the crappy manager she is!",0
"In my opinion, T-Mobile is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Sprint was transferred to Tmobile. I’ve noticed that anytime I call it’s always a 2 to 3 hour ordeal to get anything fixed, that’s if they fix it at all.My advice to anyone switching to a different plan is be prepared to pay quite a bit of money because they do not keep track of the account that you’re transferring your plan from. They don’t even know how to look it up. We switched from our business account to a 55+ account and without our knowledge they put it into a plus premium which charged us $60 more a month. Took hours to get that fixed. Also, after switching the account to the 55+ plan I paid it immediately but little to my knowledge did I know that the previous plan we were on had also billed us  Which is OK but they did not tell us about it and I found out that it was going to be turned over to collection. Tmobile needs to put all their billing access together rather than separately. When switching over the account, they did not tell us that we still owed money on our pre-contracted phones, which caused my phone to be locked so I could not even transfer to a different service without going through all the hassle of calling over and over. When I found out that we owed money for our contract phones, I immediately paid that and it still took hours and hours and hours of calling to get my phone unlocked, I am no longer a T-Mobile customer, but I would say that is the worst customer service that I have ever had to deal with. I would not recommend TMobile to anyone.",0
"I have two choices for internet where I live. The only other service is constantly broken, and does not provide even the 'guaranteed' 20Mb/s they promise. T-Mobile REFUSES TO HONOR any Affordable Connectivity Program (federal) discounts. They do not tell you this upfront, and they do not offer any other options. You cannot even lodge an official complaint with anyone. If you are disabled, and every dollar counts, DO NOT SWITCH TO T-Mobile. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.",0
"5G wireless for $50 sounds great, right? And guaranteed services! T-mobile wifi drops every time a fighter jet or plain flying over my house! Every day at random times their router would turn off and reboot constantly. After seeking T-mobile assistance for weeks they ""had no idea why their router"" kept messing up. Everyone from the services department kept saying how amazing the speed was???  Again the speed was not an issue. Not having an internet connection that they guaranteed was the problem. How is the router dropping off and on all day long when they had two 5G towers in front and back of our house? T-Mobile did NOT account for the most extensive Air Force Base, and their air runways are directly over us. Hello, the Air Force Fighter Jets have the equipment to block radio waves/5G! We never had a single person from T-Mobile help. Their guaranteed wifi was a lie. We paid them for months with their guarantees they could solve this issue; ⚠️ We Kept getting the runaround. I was distraught and never refunded anything even though I was guaranteed service🤬 Do NOT get their 5G!!!",0
"ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE! T-Mobile uses Assurant Insurance, which has their customer service department in the Phillipines. They do not speak English well. They are super disorganized. I spent more than 5 HOURS ON THE PHONE trying to process a damaged PHONE CLAIM. Even the supervisors would hang up on me and not call me back. They even shipped me a label that was inactive so I was informed by the USPS that because the Assurant shipping label did not work I had to pay to ship the device. I contacted Assurant and they said that they would not reimburse me. The agent said that they do not have a Tax ID number. This has to be the MOST INCOMPETENT COMPANY that I have ever come across. Choose a cel phone carrier that does not use Assurant Insurance. It is extremely stressful and time consuming to process claims with them.",0
"T-mobile is so bad that literally every other email I send from my phone will not go through and I have to re-create the email and resend it.  And it is not anything to do with the email server because I have four email accounts and it happens on all of them with T-Mobile. The only reason I keep them is because their service actually works really well overseas but God help you if you want to send an email in the United States from your phone.  If you are not a world traveler, get a different cell phone company.",0
"Where do I start?  First of all T-Mobile ""free phones"" is crap they are obselete phones that stopped being produced in 2021.  I went thru 3 one plus nord in 6 months.  For a whole week I had no phone bc this garbage freezes Everytime I open an app.  One rep will state one thing and when you call back there is a completely different story.  But they do ""apologize for the inconvenience"". If I hear that one more time I'm gonna spit.  So instead of giving a different phone that like you know works.  They wanted to give me a fourth one plus nord.  And nothing is free with T-Mobile. You can't upgrade for one year bc they give you a $11.75 ""credit"" so is it really free. No you pay for it in the long run.  And their customer service is the worst I have ever seen in any company.  Maybe Humana could stop by and do some training.  Any training would be better than what they are dishing out now for $75/line.  It's garbage nothing but garbage.  This is just another bad review.  Keep reading there are thousands of these.",0
"I recently went to a T-Mobile store to get New phones ,I asked if there were any  promotions available  they said yes, So they came up with 2 Samsung Galaxy Phones And two, Samsung Galaxy, Watches, they said it was all promotions, OK By the time I left the store. I paid out $295. I also got there home internet.So I inquired later on how much I would be paying monthly for all this good stuff.I was told.  $256 a month. I asked why show much.I was not informed by the store how much so they told me. 8 lines you're paying for I said. I only have 2 phones And 2 watches They said I had 8 lines . I got screwed by the people at the store and person I talk to on the phone. The guy I said I was getting a good deal. Cost each phone, Was $800.But I got it for free. That's a bunch of Bull c***.",0
"Approximately 4 years ago I purchased a 2 galaxy watches with T-Mobile. one of the watches was damaged and T-Mobile exchanged it for another watch and that required opening another account. The store clerk assured me that the first account would be canceled., After receiving my first bill I noticed I was now being charged for the 3 watches they are under wearables in the T-Mobile bill statement. I called again to explained that I only had 2 watches and the extra line they charged for was no longer owned by me. They said they would refund me and cancel. I trusted T-Mobile with that. So today October 31, 2023 I decided to check my bill and noticed T-Mobile was still charging me for that 3rd line (wearable). I reached out to customer service and they said they have canceled it and that they would only refund me $30. I brought up the fact that they owe me about 4 years worth, so they flipped it on me saying I should have checked my bill monthly and called them and they cant go back that far. Why after multiple attempts to cancel and being told it was taking care of I should have to keep calling about the same issue. I trusted the problem to be solved. I been a customer for about 20 years. I'm so disappointed in T-Mobile. I added a line about a a few months ago and was told I get a free phone and then they said no free phone because of my plan. T-Mobile you treating your faithful customers that been with you for over 10 years like crap. I should be refunded for the watch.",0
T-Mobile's service is literally so bad that every time I send an email from my phone I can count on 1 or 2 not going thru and having to recompose and resend. Just garbage reception and customer service,0
"All I can honestly say is, they are not an honest company and you would be better to pay off any equipment that you have, albeit expensive in the time, but worth it in the end. Go, matter of fact, run to a different company. They are not an honest company. Nor do they care.",0
"I recently signed up for TMobile service because the rep at Walmart lured me in with a deal on the phone.  Never again!  I have tried to deal with customer service, and it is horrible.  Long massive wait times on hold speaking with people from the other side of the world who do not know what they're doing.  This is the first and LAST month of service I use with them.  They need to fix their staffing problems and stop abusing customers with long hold times with incompetent people who do not know how to solve issues.",0
"I been charge on my bank account 279 for not returning box when I did it so it’s been 3 months since then keep charge and when I call them says they will gimme a credit for it an this mont my bill it’s again almost 300 hundred dollars, ever time I call I have to explain why they shouldn’t charge me that money cuz I already send the box and tell them the route number and they gimme the confirmation that they get the box it’s been frustrated, why every time I call I have to spend 30 minutes explaining that they overcharge me.",0
"Waited on hold for over two hours for a supervisor only to keep it in transferred to a different customer service rep disconnected by representative twice. Very rude and unprofessional, promised follow up which did not happen. Over all very appalling conversations and no resolution.",0
"They deserve  a negative, they say keep and switch. It is totally  bait and switch. Lied about everything. 3 of us changed to t mobile. And it has been completely  horrible since the start.  Pay off your phone/ good luck on that. Took 6 months of countless emails and calls to get them to pay off my phone.  Said $240 each on costco gift cards. We got 2 for $75.  Our service  area has went from bad with Verizon  to horrible with Tmobile.     Will tell you your not an authorized  customer. How can you not be an authorized  customer  when you have an account with them????  I now tell everyone to stay completely  away from T mobile  it is that horrible!!!!!",0
The worst customer service ever. Sprint was much better.,0
"I have had a very bad experience with T-Mobile right from the get-go. They're employed lied to me and I have been lied to for the last 2 weeks. They have my phone I have no refund. I'm disabled on disability, they basically ripped me off. When An employee tells you that your refund will be on your card by Monday, and you talk to somebody else on monday. And they say he shouldn't ever said that. Aren't they supposed to honor what they say? But any business that Hires other people from a different country. And doesn't keep our money in our country shame on you.",0
I upgraded with T-Mobile and did not receive the device.  Multiple people callled me to wait an entire day for delivery - it never came they put me on hold for more than 30 minutes and asked me to pay deposit again and then wanted to charge me again.  Worst service in th world,0
I'd give a zero if I could. there accounting is all messed up their phone serve ice is shotty and drops. I get a collection letter then the rep says ignore the collection letter but there is a balance owed different form the collection letter. this is after they send me a final bill to close out the account of a different amount.,0
"Our old phone carrier shut down so we were forced to change carriers. I went to a T-Mobile store in Maize, KS and Maria, the lady that helped me, told me we would definitely have 5G coverage where we live. I questioned her about that several times during our interaction because my husband and I live very rural and when I looked at the coverage map before heading into the store, coverage looked spotty. She kept telling me we would FOR SURE have 5G coverage. I didn't purchase a new phone until I knew it would work at our house. After a couple weeks, I decided to purchase a new device with them because we at least had 4G coverage. Then, shortly after the 14 day return period expired, our service is almost nonexistent. I called customer service and the guy I spoke to informed me that he would have never sold us a plan and phones because his map showed almost no coverage where we live. He told me that we basically get ""left over"" signals from a tower that is very far away from us and the reason we don't have service now is because they were having problems with said tower. I asked when the tower was going to be up and he said he didn't know. Now, we don't get service, thank goodness we have wifi or my new expensive phone (that they won't let me pay off early or return) would be a paper weight. The only way out from under them now is to pay off mine and my husband's devices at full retail pricing, not just the sale pricing. My husband's phone hasn't even left the box, but we can't return it. I asked the customer service guy if there's anything we can do since we don't have service and he said, ""No, nothing."" So basically we have to pay ridiculous prices to them but our phones only work on wifi, that we also have to pay for. I'm extremely disappointed with T-Mobile. We'll be switching to Verizon as soon as we're able to.",0
"T-Mobile Money are Employees are a compulsive liars, habitual liars, pathological liars, scammers, Ponzi schemers. They are very inconsiderate. They were close customers are pills for no reason. You file disputes, they think your threat for filing disputes and/or too many disputes. Because they figured out that someone was stealing your identity and stealing your money from the card. So then they came to a decision to close your account. I don’t recommend T-Mobile Money. Stay away from these careless morons",0
"Very upset with T mobile now. Got a text saying my service was going to be disconnected for no payment. Not sure how that can be considering I am on autopay. They are saying a payment from July 27, 2023 was returned. Why did it take over three months for them to contact me and now they will not let me pay my bill with a credit card, has to be a checking account and I do not give anyone my banking info. So in morning go phone shopping (mostl likely xfinity). Obviously over 15 years of service with Sprint don't mean anything to Tmobile.1mReply",0
HorribleWe haven’t even been with them a month & I want to leave which I would if it wouldn’t effect credit. I will only list a few things 1st they lied in store we switched over from our another company which we liked only reason we switched was due to the in store customer service at location near us. ((I regret leaving now) they offered us a great deal on phones watches etc the one watch they did not have at the moment gentlemen helping us said come back Thursday(was Tuesday we were there) offer will still be good we can override the fee u will get watch for same price which was $26 so we got the one went back Thursday get to the second watch all of a sudden things changed can’t do it wanted well over $100 which I would of if they said that but I was pissed and they should of honored it like they said so I left annoyed.So that was that then they still set watch up and had linked to our phone yet never received watch was a biotch to get that corrected couldn’t do it in the store(of course) and customer service kept telling us it was in the mail was not understanding we didn’t get the watch it was not being sent etc. u can tell they r reading a script and have no real knowledge of anything majority of the time. so I should of known that the bad taste was going to continue to linger. I feel the service is horrible got new iphone 1/2 stuff don’t work can’t connect. I had a refurbished older version iPhone and had way better connection before . I would not recommend this company to anyone I heard so many bad things since this company has been out I stayed away due to that reason for many years. We decided give it a try plus they lured us in with the great deal should of stayed away big mistake. Like I said hasn’t even been a full month and on top of all this I’m paying almost $200 a month more to be miserable and in happy with service and not being able to use all the functions cause connection blows. If thinking about switching please do yourself a favor don’t. I never write reviews ever but I had to if this helps even 1 person. Don’t make same mistake cause I’m stuck now. I wish I could give it a positive one i at the moment have not one positive thing to say except they are good liars.,0
"One might guess that the Customer ""Service"" folks at T-Mobile CHAT....or the phone employees...are taught to LIE and make promises that none of them follow thru on.",0
I think T-Mobile customer service is wonderful I've never had any problem with them for the last 21 years period however T-Mobile has decided to block me from customer service. I can't call there if I call there I get put on eternal hole. Most of the time I can't get into my T-Mobile or T-Mobile to see the billing or to try and chat with someone. If I call from another phone I can get through or I did get through now they've caught that and it started blocki.ng me using someone else's phone. Oh well I forgot to mention T-Mobile's billing I thought was perfect for every charge there is a date and an explanation I have been having two charges with no explanation of what it's for. And the problem with accessing my my T-Mobile or T-Mobile so that I can watch the account during the month is a problem for me so I will be saying goodbye and I hope that just that this does not happen to anyone else,0
My sister had just got out of high school in 2019 and  went with T- mobile and she was happy with them. I meant her for lunch then went to T- mobile in October 2021 to upgrade her phone. She talked me into switching fromAT&T to T- Mobile I finally agreed. I told the rep I would pay in full for my new phone. He then suggested i trade in my current phone for ($400) iPhone 8 Plus I said okay what’s my balance? He told me I would have to wait 60 days before my old phone would post on my account. What he didn’t tell me was they pro- rate that amount over two years 90 days in I try to pay the balance off and they had only applied $40 dollars to my account. I was so mad that I called them up and asked for my phone back and told them I would pay that 40 dollars but they said they couldn’t do that. I paid the bill for the next 20 months on time in full . I called them to ask my balance because I was moving to somewhere else. They fail to tell me that I had a $ 40 credit before I ported my number over and sent me a bill after that and told me they didn’t have to give me that  credit. So please be careful when trading in your phones when you take good care of them like I do …,0
"I've been a TMobile customer for over 20 years, since it was Aerial, back in 1997.For more than 6 months, I've been paying late fees because my payment due date was originally the 13th of each month and I usually make my payment when I get paid on the 15th of each month. In August, I contacted TMobile Customer Service  to request my payment due date to be changed to at least the 15th of each month. For my surprise, after I was informed that the change was made, the following bill (September) was still reflecting the 10th as the due date for the payments. I patiently contacted TMobile Customer Service once again and supposedly, the issue was resolved, but I still had to pay the late charges. When I received the notification for the October payment, once again, the due date reflected is the 10th. I contacted TMobile again and I was given a credit so ok. I was also explained that I could schedule a payment on October 15th or 16th, as a payment arrangement, and that the November payment was to be due as requested, on or after the 15th of each month. For my surprise, and once again, I just received the notification about my bill with a due date of 11/10th and this time the total amount due is $20 higher than the last amount paid.I contacted customer service once again, this time yelling and screaming to whom identified himself as a Supervisor, Brandon, who stated that he was able to change the due date but I will still be responsible to pay the November bill on the 10th. He offered a $20 credit (A JOKE, AN INSULT) as damage control. Ridiculous.I'm not asking for $20.  I'm asking to get the due date fixed. I feel it is unfair that after over 20 years of paying on time, I need to keep paying late fees due to the incompetency of the TMobile's staff, where nobody seems to be able to make a simple change to an account. As a mortgage loan processor, I know the importance of paying on time; however, looks like TMobile is unwilling to help in order to keep collecting late fees.",0

After reiterating the story multiple times with agents and a supervisor I was assured (with confirmations) the refund would arrive. It Never came. Request began in August.

"On October 7, 2023 I went to a T-Mobile store located at 100 Viewmont Mall 842, Scranton, PA 18508. I went into the store and HUNTER helped me. Hunter told me about a promotion and a trade in value. Hunter asserted to me and multiple other people including the account owner that the promotion they were running was for $350.00 PLUS IN ADDITION the trade in value of the old phone which was valued at $260.00 for a total of $610.00 being applied to the new phone making the installment payments a total of $24.58 monthly. On October 12, 2023 the phone was received and I was to do the deferred trade in for the old phone. Went to a T-mobile store near home and was told that the information I had was inaccurate and I should call the store that provided that information. On October 14, 2023, I spoke to a representative named Jennifer over the phone (recorded calls) and explained the situation, she promised me a call back Monday October 16, 2023. THIS CALL NEVER OCCURRED BECAUSE SHE NEVER CALLED ME On October 16, 2023 after failure by Jennifer to call me back I called again and was transferred to Nadia another rep. I explained the situation to her and because of the situation she sent me to her Supervisor Danielle. Danielle said that there was nothing they could do to honor the price the EMPLOYEE gave me on October 7, 2023. T-mobile's employee misrepresented the terms of the promotion to MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN RELIANCE THE MISREPRESENTED TERMS THE AGREEMENT WAS AGREED TO TMOBILE DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THERE OWN EMPLOYEE'S ERRORS. To put into context, there was misinformation provided by TMOBILE'S EMPLOYEE who they TRAIN and who they are RESPONSIBLE FOR. As a result of the inaccurate information my payments are higher for the new phone then what was represented to me on October 7, 2023. I tried to speak with TMOBILE and they refuse to rectify the situation saying they cannot do anything about it. After 13 years I believe it is time to leave.",0
"We had T-Mobile internet service for 19 months.  The T-Mobile service at the beginning was pretty good, with the service freezing needing a restart only about once a week. However, the towards the end in August of 2023, the gateway(modem) needed to be restarted several times a day in order to function. Around the same time T-Mobile removed the $5 discount for auto pay if you were using a credit card. Something they had allowed for over a year. On Aug 23rd we ordered Xfinity. The Xfinity gateway would be delivered in several days. On Aug 24th, 2023 I called customer service and told them I wished to cancel. However, customer service said I needed to try a new gateway first to see if that would correct the problem. I figured I would compare them both. T-Mobile sent a replacement quickly, but it did not do much better with Mbps download of 44.  The Xfinity gateway came a few days later with Mbps in the 400's for downloads without any problems. I canceled T-Mobile service on Sept 2, 23 through their customer service. When canceling they requested the 6 digit number that I gave them when I signed up 19 months earlier.  I gave them the number I had written down in my T-Mobile file. The customer service rep said it was the wrong number. I said that is the one I uses. They said it was imperative that I give them the 6-digit code.  I asked if they could use my soc sec number or email me a reset and they said no. They said that I would have to physically go to a T-Mobile store and request my 6-digit number after they verified my identity.  I drove to the nearest store located at 2024 IL-50 Ste A1, Bourbonnais IL 60914 and spoke with a rep named Michael.  He said he could not give me the 6-digit number and told me to call customer service back and tell them so. I went home and called and told them what he said, and they said okay and that they would email a return label for the gateway.  I received the email with the label on September 2nd, 2023 and returned the gateway to UPS. T-Mobile received the gateway on Sept 11 23.  I received a letter stating that ""They received the gateway, and no further action is needed on your part."" Then on Sept 19, 23 T-Mobile collected an auto pay of $55 from my credit card on file.  I called my credit card to dispute the charge.  T-Mobile sent me a new bill asking for the $55, plus $25 for a chargeback, Plus the next months $55 for a total of $135.  I called customer service on Oct 7, 23, and they said I needed to go to an actual store because they could not help me again because of the 6-digit pin saying the one I gave them was incorrect. I went to the store in Bradley Il and they told me that the account had never been canceled, even though customer service sent the return label and had received the gateway. The store contacted T-mobile customer service from their store and eventually a very rude corporate manager named Patrick said that they insisted I pay the full $135.  I explained I had cancelled the service on Sept 2, 23 and returned the gateway.  He said it was T-Mobiles' policy to have you also physically come to the store to cancel and that it wasn't officially canceled until that day which was over a month later. I told him I physically went to the T-Mobile store but Michael would not give me the pin.  He scolded me saying I should have used the phrase ""I wish to have you cancel my account"" I explained that I had already done that with customer service rep on the phone and that I had told Michael that I needed the pin number for them to cancel it. Patrick from Corporate says that I am repeating myself and it was my fault for not saying that I wanted Michael to cancel the account.  He then said that he would offer me a one-time deal that he would forgive the last months charge and that he was being very gracious in doing so.  I again told him I didn't even have a gateway to use the service and that T-Mobile had it after sending me the return email and label. He again said it was never fully canceled to their satisfaction whatever that means.  We went round and round until I said I would pay $55 for the month I disputed even though I had canceled the service just to end the madness. He said he also insisted on the $25. I said no and that I wanted to only pay $55 only on that day.  He said it would cost an additional $10 to have an operator take my payment.  I asked if I could do it online without a charge and he said yes but it would not give me a confirmation.  Because he was not helpful at all we ended the call.  I went home and paid $55 online and still received a confirmation number. It seemed that Patrick was trying to squeeze even more money from me. The amount of time and effort I have put into resolving this is ridicules. There appears to be no training for customer service either at the store level or at corporate.Update 10/15/23  T-Mobile reached out and we reached a mutual understanding.",0
for starters they suspended my account and when i contacted them they said it was “accidental” and unsuspended it. not to bad but then i couldn’t change my plan or view any other plans in app. i opened a triuble ticket and nothing happened so i was stuck with my call/text unlimited only. NO DATA and then the next month i got charged 466 dollars for data roaming and using excessive data when i had NO DATA and 0 BYTES USED. contacted customer support and got told nothing they could do and then they recommended upgrading my plan and getting their home internet. this company is terrible and a scam. don’t recommend,0
"I was trying to purchase one of there Military Plans and was quoted a specific rate including trade in for 3 phone at no cost. A glitch in getting me a docusign agreement to sign was the beginning of my problems. The original rep who was going to fix it never called back. The next rep was going to check but never called back. The next rep sent me to a local store that was unable to help me. The next rep said they could fix it but it would take 24 hours and someone would call me, which they did. That rep however advised me that the plan I was quoted (and verified with each rep along the way did not exist and i would have to pay an additional $30 per month to get the phones i wanted. I then spoke to a supervisor who told me the same thing. So, multiple hours over 4 days wasted.",0
"Ranks at the very bottom of my experiences over the past 55 years with companies.  Three weeks ago, we contacted T-Mobile about upgrading our cell phones to newer models.  We currently have 7 lines with T-Mobile and all but one of our cell phones is paid off.  I cannot get a quote or straight answer, despite spending more than 4 hours and 5 different reps.  We're ready to switch to AT&T or Verizon!",0
"I have had T-mobile for seven years and never had a problem other than the service sucks in a lot of areas. But now they have outsourced thier customer service to another country and they can't even help you, I am not even sure you can get someone in America any more , I will be switching to spectrum",0
Just junk reception. Literally 15-18 emails come thru at once a lot of the time because of poor reception.,0
"T-Mobile will increase your bill after you sign a contract. Then they won't credit your account because their hands are tied. If you have any other options for phone service, use them first.",0
Very unethical business practices. As a 20 year customer (Sprint/TMobile)  Made a payment arrangement. Employee failed to note. Phone was turned off causing numerous problems. Management refused to own employees mistake. Don’t trust this company. I don’t feel they care about the customer.,0
One hour holds. Not helping customers with their issues. This is the T-Mobile way.,0
"I have been with T-Mobile seven years and I always have a payment arrangement every month because I’m a senior citizen on a fixed income .I was not able to keep the payment arrangement and only needed it to be extended by one day, which is  24 hours and they weren’t willing to accommodate me at all after seven years this is the first time they’ve ever denied me an extension!! I guess because they’ve gotten the monopoly on cell phone companies  now and all they are concerned with is making money. Thank God I don’t have a contract with them and I will never get another contract with them and as far as purchasing iPhone 15’s I will definitely be purchasing them through another company . This company offers No empathy at all,  no care or concern, and the managers are the worst.",0
I was told that my account was canceled multiple times and it wasn't. They continue to demand payment and refuse to work with me. It takes a lot of time to get a hold of a customer service rep. When I do they contradict each other and are pretty much completely unhelpful. A total nightmare to deal with. Just go with a different provider.,0
"I just got mobile service and continue to drop calls. My internet box never worked. My phone was hacked first month and I had 4 gran taken out of my bank acct. Viruses, they nickel and dine u, only want to help u if u buying something.",0
TMobile Customer Service Stinks.  I was on hold over hour and a half which is totally unacceptable.  I am going to consider changing my service because customer service is as much important.  They treat you as though once your a customer its ok to slack in other areas but so not the case.,0
"I have been with Sprint for 20+ years now T-Mobile. I was shopping to see if I should switch to ATT with my wife's legacy plan or have her move with me on my Sprint legacy plan. I called the T-Mobile customer services line as I was shopping for rates they told me that I would get a 20% discount if I went to a different plan and I could add my wife. They send me a link I fill out the information. T-Mobile sent me an email to call they confirmed it's 15%. As I was ready to switch the contract, I double-checked I called the number again 877-384-0296, and yet again they said yes it's 15% and I am eligible for it. After they switched me to a more expensive plan there was no 15% discount, I called them and they said they apologized but I am not eligible for the 15% discount. I have spent hours on the phone they refused to pull the recording and listen to it to honor what they told me twice. I am currently looking to leave T-Mobile as it has been a nightmare for me since they bought Sprint. I highly recommend you do not do business with companies that do not honor their words especially when you have been with them for 20 years. I am looking to exit my contract with them and sign up with a different carrier. Haresh P.",0
"T-MOBILE  isn't a the phone company you will want to us. While we used them we had nothing but issues and costumer service couldn't ever fix the problem. Once we canceled with them we found out they had been charging us for an additional line the whole time. It's now been 3 month after closing our account and they again took money from our account. We spoke to two different managers and one says we still owed money (which we dont) and the other says ""I see everything is paid in full and I'm not sure why we took another payment. We can reimburse you, however, it's going to take about 60 days.""We will never use T-MOBILE  again!",0
"THEY ARE NOTHING BUT LIARS! Their advertising is false, they DETEST THE MILITARY, they do not stand by their products, & their customer service, especially Shane, will lie from the first word out of their mouths! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BUSINESS!!! Oh & the read from a scripts & just keep at it. Liars, all of them!",0
"Customer service is in a different country than where I'm at, U.S. They don't know the US and they couldn't find my address in Vermont. And it took them 40 minutes on hold to find the nearest T-MOBILE store in Burlington (after I gave them the location). I found it on Google maps in 3 minutes but stayed on hold until they found it. So bad.",0
T-Mobile is a fraud and criminals. I traded in my new phone and they didn’t meet the deal they promised. They cancelled the contract and I had to call every month to get a credit. They stole my phone and then wouldn’t give me my monthly credit. I ended up having to pay for the phone outright and move to Verizon. Do not ever use Tmobile services!,0
First Time Dealing With Customer Service Where The Employees Seemed To Not Have A Solution To Anything Or They Was Just Guessing At It But It Started From Me Trying To File A Claim On My Phone Because I Couldn’t Call My Girlfriend Unless We Was Connected To The Same Wi-Fi And They Ran Test And It Was Something To Do With The Phone So I Went Through With The Claim People And The Man Told Me All I Had To Do Was Take The Phone In Store He Already Sent My Info And They Would Switch It Out Which Wasn’t The Case At All And On Top Of That I Had Sent My Black Iphone Back Still New Damn Near No Scratches Nothing Never Drop Water Damage Nothing I Get To The Store To Pick Up My New Phone And It’s White Which They Didn’t Tell Me Before Hand So The Woman Ask If I Wnated To Wait I Could Return This One And I’m Literally Done With Them At This Point Before Hand To Even Get The Clain The Customer Service Calls Getting Nothing But Disappointment Because The First Rep Told Me They Noted Everything Down So If The Steps Didn’t Work If I Had To Call Back It Would Already Show We Did All The Trouble Shooting And Just To Send Me To The Claims Department Just To Find Out Nothing Was Noted So I’m Trying To Explain To The Man I Just Want To Take Out The Claim I’ve Already Did All The Steps Which I Get Hung Up On After Him Saying He Was Going To Transfer For The Line And To Make A Long Story Short It Seemed That They Hired The First People They Step Out Side And Seen Like It Was Horrible I’ve Never Felt Disrespected By A Company As Much As I Did By Them It Was Like No Concern About My Issue At All But I Ended Up Suing Them And Not Even Getting What Was Agreed By Choice Because It Wasn’t More So About The Money With Me But The Lack Of Service That Many People Pay For That Wasn't Met if Your Going To Run A Billion Dollar Company At least Pay For Some Employees That’s Going To Keep A Business Looking Good Not Ones That’s Going To Get You A Lawsuit,0
"Tmobile did not have my correct email address om file and when I had fraud detected from my bank account my automatic payments were no longer going thru to Tmobile, however they sent the alerts only to a bad email address and waited 3 months before my service was shut ff which alerted me to the need to update my auto payment. I have since paid over $500 per month due to all of the reconnect fees that my bill is consistently over $1000 a month regardless if I contact them prior to the phones being shut off and then I am promised that no fees will be assessed buy then the next person I talk to tells me the reason it is so high is due to the fees and then they promise me to not chargeE but do anyways. And then proceed to shut my phone service off again 2 weeks after I've just paid them over $500!!!In addition I had insurance on each line because 2 of them are for children.  My 10 year old first lost his phone and thr claim was denied for fraud and I could not speak to anyone with the knowledge of how or why my claim was fraud. I then got him another phone I paid for out of pocket and then he broke the screen amd again insurance said it was fraud and would not replace it. I requested tmobike to cancel my insurance on every line and to reimburse me of each month I have paid for insurance ewhen I have been denied my coverage.And now my phone is shut off every two weeks without fail regardless that I am paying about $500 every 2 weeks for 4 phone lines!!DO NOT GO THROUGH TMOBILE!! THEY ARE LIARS AND WILL NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH PROGRAMS SUCJ AS INSURANCE THAT HOU PAY MONTHLY FOR BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE NOR EVEN GET AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IT IS SUPPOSEDLY FRAUD!WILL NEVER RECCOMMENE TMOBILE THEY ARE A SCAM AND A HORRIBLE COMPANY WHO WILL CONTINUOISLY ROB PEOPLE BLIND AND SMILE WHILE THEY DO IT!!",0

The device is locked and cripples the  dual sim feature especially when traveling. The customer support advised to get another phone for travel. So sad!,0
"The customer service aspect of t-mobile is not any better than it was 5 years ago.For those considering a switch to T-Mobile internet, you may want to give it caredul thought.The service may be shutting down orpossibly throttled late in the evening. However, I can not identify if it is the internwt service, a third party service platform ir a particular program.T-Mobile offers the ""perk"" of Paramount+ Showtime. The perk part of it is only the convenience of billing through T-Mobile. I am thinking the benefit runs to T- Mobile rather than the customer.Paramount promises local channels. For CBS, I can access TX, CA, GA,BOS, PA, MO, FL and many other stations but not CBS in Tucson. I spent hours on the phone with Paramount+ but one is not allowed to speaj to tech support. It goes on from their. It does not seem that Paramount+ is interested in fulfilling its obligations.",0
I have been with sprint / t mobile for 17 years never ever had a problem with sprint but tmobile I was late on my bill one time in 17 years and they want to charge 160 for a reconnect fee on top of my 190 bill I am beyond mad I might go to Verizon,0
Same thing bait and switch. Said credit for phone then never mentioned I would have to pay for the phone for two. My bad for not reading the fine print but the store made it sound like the phone was paid off and the contract was for two years.,0

"Absolute horror story beginning to end. Wrong trade in phone written on the order, had to return brand new phone and completely start over after hours in the store and three days waiting for the phone. Then SIM card they installed in the old phone wasn’t  activated, was told it was xfinity’s fault and wasted hours trying to get it resolved only to find out it was TMobile all along. Another week of no service. Then phone couldn’t be activated after 4.5 hours, was told it was their connection but it didn’t work at our home either. Finally got issue resolved after multiple days, one hour trips each way and several hours in the store, calls, texts, etc. Then received notification our checking account was debited, wanted to use a credit card from the beginning, wasn’t told it would be an additional $20 per month. Was told we received a credit for trade in phone against out of pocket costs, which never happened. Several calls to customer service later our service is more expensive than we were told, there’s an additional charge for a phone and the credit doesn’t offset it, and no one seems able to understand the simple math that $120 credit against $120 charges equals $0. What a mistake.",0
"T Mobile SUCKS. Worst thing I ever did switching. Dropped calls when in 5 bar service area, texts that never get delivered or people tell me they sent a text and I never get them. It's not random either, poor service all the time.",0
"About a year ago I decided to switch  from Verizon after 38 years to T Mobile since they were offering big deals to switch. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!!Their customer service is awful, their deals are not what they promise and they cannot fix their issues.After 6 days I went back to Verizon. This experience Cost me about $100 and a lot of headaches!!!!!Think twice before you change your service!!!!",0
The area I live in suppose to be compatible with T mobile. I live in Apex NC. T mobile is the worst phone carrier I ever had. Every month a tower is down and I’m unable to use my phone not to mention my dumb ass got there internet to so when my phone is down I can’t even use my internet. Then they tell me o we will credit ur account lies they tell. This happens to me at least three to four times a month. I’m am over there trash ass service. You’re not compatible in my area stop your lies t mobile. Once I pay my last phone off I’m switching my service.,0

"Switching tmobile has been nothing but a nightmare,I came from spectrum mobile on the Verizon network , never had any issues using data in my home ,  my data speed on the 4g lte network was around 140 megabit per second download but verizon has no 5g network I'm my area so I came to tmobile there 5g speed is abouy 50 megabits Now I have no data connection in my home I have towers everywhere around me there is no excuse. 1 week in to the plan data just disappears in and out constantly,   I got mixed reasons chat says tower upgrade then chat again says no tower upgrade and phone support says tower upgrade ,  don't they let customers know their services will be interrupted?Trade your device with T-MOBILE is far from trade ins.  When you take your car for a trade in the trade value gets deducted from the new car sale .. not as a credit..smh but here it's we buy your device and just give you credit on your account so you can buy more tmobile products with your creditIt's not a trade inNow I'm looking to go back to my old carrier",0
"In November 2021, I traded-in 3 phones (family plan) for a total trade-in value of $2400 ($800 each) at T-mobile. T-mobile promised to return the $2400 in the form of a one time credit and further credits spread over 30 months. However, I have had to call in dozens of time spending close to 50 hours on the phone with them to get the credits. Each time, I'm promised a refund only to see a small partial credit. Each time, I argue with the company to honor the contract, I'm assured a refund of the payments due.After I filed a on the phone  complaint with the FCC, t-mobile now tells me they will honor the trade in credit but start the 30 month cycle 13 months after the original contract date. They are not willing to give in writing Tbey abrogated the contract.Given this is affecting thousands of customers, it is possible T-mobile swindles customers of a couple of billion $ every year.If we get more than 40 customers willing to go to court, we could file a class action lawsuit against T-mobile?",0
"If this service had 0 stars I would give zero stars to T Mobile Sales and Billing. I am not sure that the promises made by Telesales are real. So far, there is a discrepancy between the Tele-sales offer and the billing. I agreed to transfer five lines from ATT. I have the pdf file with the chat with Tmobile sales. The deal was for $176 per month including taxes and fees after some 20% insider code promo—also, four ""free"" iPhones 14s with no trade-in. I signed a contract for the New four phones 14s for $129 per month but  I was told the promo for moving from att would give me an equal credit of $129 every month for 24 months. When I called the billing they told me my monthly will be $280 per month and only two phones are ""free"" the other two  I have to pay for. If I complete the Port  from ATT to T mobile I would pay $80 more per month and have to pay for the iPhone 14s. The customer service is hard to understand and there is a lot of background noise. Some call centers overseas. The last person helping finally told me verbally that indeed I was going to get what I was promised but it could not be put in writing. (leap of faith?) I am tempted to return the unopened four iPhone 14s to T mobile and keep ATT, I have only transferred one line with a phone I own.  I have not ported the other four lines because I suspect it will be a billing nightmare. I have spent close to 5 hours dealing with billing so they can not guarantee my bills to reflect what TElesales sold me on. Legally, they made me sign an installment purchase for the phones but all the promotions are verbal statements or in the chat.  No one seems to care about the chat transcripts. They also, indicate to pay the wrong bills and that they are corrected eventually. In other words once I am stuck with the phones they own me and they can bill whatever they want. How can this company be gaining so many new customers with the BAIT and Switched strategy? These people need to be accountable.",0

"I was told I was getting a free phone. Unfortunately, I was on automatic payment so I didn't see my bill. They not only charged me for the ""free"" phone, they charged me for insurance.

"I would prefer to give them zero stars.t-mobile ported my phone number without being able to activate my phone. They keep saying I need to come in to a store to activate so I keep reminding them I am out of the US. Now I have no access to my US phone number. I cannot even get out of t-mobile and back to my previous carrier because they cannot send me a text to confirm my number because I have no service. I have wasted literally hours on the phone and many dollars of international phone time trying to get them to fix this and they are incapable of even releasing my phone number to me. I've tried emailing or using their chat feature to avoid the expense of international calling, but I cannot login because my phone isn't working and they do not allow anyone to email or chat without first logging in. I am beyond angry with them. I responded to a request for feedback 3 weeks ago and checked their box requesting follow up contact from a manager, but have heard nothing. They are horrible.Follow-up: Back in the US, still can't cancel because now they say my account is suspended and I somehow owe them almost $200. I still have not had service from them, never received any bills, and have spend more hours on the phone with customer service people who cannot help.

"I've been with the company for 23 years.  I was going to switch carriers, but was offered a new phone to stay while maintaining my current bill, which according to the agent ""would have to be adjusted manually each month"",but promised that it would be taken care of.  Subsequently each month it has not been taken care of and I have to call and ask for an adjustment each month.  A supervisor even went back and reviewed the phone call of the original agreement and credited my account and apologized and informed me that it would be adjusted,  but yet after 5 months I'm still dealing with it.  Today, I was told that it could no longer be adjusted and I'm stuck with a higher bill an extra phone line that I don't want or need.....and if I cancel it, I have to pay the full price of my new phone.  Deceptive and frustrating.",0
"I've been a customer for 16 years. I recently switched companies. I canceled my service 3 days before the start of my billing cycle in July. In August, I noticed a charge to my bank account for a full month's service, which was canceled over a month prior. I was told that even though the number had been switched over for 3 days, the account was closed the day that the billing cycle started. How convenient! After spending over 1.5 hours talking to reps, telling me I need to go into a physical location (more inconvenience) for me, they acknowledged that if anything, I should have been billed at a pro-rated rate of just one day.  I disagreed and the supervisor rep finally told me they would credit my account the full payment amount, not even pro-rated. I called my bank and had them halt the payment of the charge because T-Mobile was able to take my money in a day but it would take up to 10 business days to return my money.Fast-forward to a few weeks later, and we get a bill in the mail for the full-amount, plus an additional $30 fee. We called T-Mobile again and had another supervisor waive the entire fee, which was supposed to have been waived a few weeks prior. This time we recorded the call at least.Fast-forward to last night and we got yet another bill in the mail from T-Mobile. Called and they said we had a $0 balance and all was resolved. We chalked it up to the previous call being made after that last bill was sent to us.Today we received a letter from a collections agency from T-Mobile. So in a month and a half of the bill being ""late"" (even though they admitted 2 times being in the wrong), they sent us to collections.I've had perfect credit my entire life, and T-Mobile is trying to do what they can to change that over their mistake. This is how they treated a long-time loyal customer. Disgusting company.",0

"Tried to switch services with T-Mobile, Service and signal from them on my phone was not good.. tried their service for 1 week They had one excuse after another not to give me a refund back of what they had charged me for, They somehow took a payment out of my account that prepay had been canceled from. They gave me a run around of probably two weeks different people then tried to charge me more than next month so they charged me $16.15 for a trial period of maybe 7 days Not a company company to deal with. all the way around they're not honest I spent 45 minutes on the phone with someone trying to straighten this out She acted like she knew what she was doing and was going to give me full credit back  Then by the time the conversation was ending her dollar amount changed!!

Im so disappointed I have excellent credit I switched 4 lines to T-Mobile from att. I wasnt to upgrade my 2 lines and they want me to pay high down payments on phones they lied to me over and over on at customer service that they would fix it but they didn’t after 4 calls still got the run around how they care I will leave reviews everywhere how they lied to me. I even asked about upgrades when I got the new service. They said Every customer is different that you get a spending limit. I have a 795 credit score and it’s just not right I will go back to att where I can get anything I want and just pay taxes. I would have never switched to save 30 bucks a month.,0
It sucks and I have plenty of towers around me. It's not consistent. I lose signal and get buffering all the time watching tv. Many times it interferes with downloading. I will move gateway around the house constantly. Customer service is a joke. Was promised a local team but many times outsourced far away. The last thing they pulled is no longer allowing credit cards for auto pay. They had a data breach just last year (UPDATE) and another one just this week. I refuse to hand over the keys to my bank account to appease this mega rich corporation who cares less about my money. I am done with them.,0
"If I could give 0 star or negative, I would.Customer Service sucks. Signal sucks. Overpriced service.I paid my phone in full but I could not get my phone unlocked. And it has been more than 7 days.

But nothing has resolved.Who gives Tmobile the right to hold my phone hostage for weeks while I have paid my phone in full?Boycott the company!",0

We were quoted a plan price (written down by sales salesperson).  We got a text saying sign up for automatic payments and you will get another $5 discount per line.  Come to find out, if we did not sign up for auto-payment it would cost more. No discount there. Bait and Switch.2. One line could not be activated the first day we purchased the other two phones.  Based on sales rep advice, we activated the line and they would roll the activated number to an actual new phone the following weekend.  We were charged for 2 activation fees.3.  The quoted price for the phones we traded in was inaccurate - to the tune of $400 less than quoted.4.  The customer service rep was very rude when we tried to understand what was going on and he basically said we should have known what the phone was worth and that when the phone was sent in, someone made the decision.  (We can understand if it was broken or water damaged of course the value should be reduced, but really if your employees do not know the value of a phone or mislead, or lie about the value, isn't that on the company??5.  Coverage across rural SD and MN is not good.  Dropped calls several times over the miles.6.  So after month 2 bill, the cost is much higher than expected.  Oh yes and be sure your tech skills are strong as you will have to navigate their website and the app.",0

"Be aware of their AT&T promotion. I have been  customer individually for almost 4 years and business customer for way longer. I decided to use their promotion $1000 for trade in. They offered me $1,000 promo trade in for my 13 Pro Max 512 GB for 3 year contract. Today I got message they give me only $350 for the phone in a perfect condition without any scratch (always had screen protector and case on) that I could trade in to Apple Store for $350 without any contract or sell privately for about $650. I consider that to be a real scam and I do not want to be customer any more and want my old phone back.

They told her the first month would be a little over a $100 well it was 211, her phone bill plus phone payment is supposed to run $86 a month total, not $113 like this month.. Very inconsistent and I would definitely not recommend.. I’m not sure if it’s a problem with all att stores or just the one in Berea Kentucky.. Not pleased, fixing to return phone and go with different carrier",0

"worst service ever !! Im in Thailand all my friends either had a ESIM card or their Carrier  gave them either free days or signed them up for a one month international plan at a very good price .AT&T Does neither ! You can NOT get a intl plan you have to pay 12.99 a Day! You can NOT use a SIM card, AT&T  Carrier will not allow it unless your phone is paid off and even then only certain ones .. so I have to pay 190.00 for 2 week vacation. And they said today counted because I called THEM!! would not even credit me for calling them .. They just want you to give more money to them!!I’m a Realtor in Washington and since I switched , I can’t tell you how bad the service is , literally showing a house in the city and No service !! embarrassing to clients  !! switching carriers as soon as I get Back !!

They are doing everything illegally. I cannot even move to other service as they made me to stay with them for 3 years. Made a very big mistake moving from Verizon to AT&T. I wish AT&T go bankrupt soon. They are losing customer confidence. Their billing is most corrupt in the nation. Please don't believe Costco AT&T sales people are any sales and move blindly to AT&T. Tmobile has a better service than AT&T in NJ. Lets all sue AT&T for the illegal business practice they are doing.,0

AT&T fees are excessive $45 plus $10 they offer you discounts and they never give them. Look for other options that offer better service. I would never recommend to AT&T,0
Bought a new phone as trade in 17 months ago and discovered that at&t auto pay and the line from old phone was still continuing so was charged since then. They never bothered to discontinue the line when switched to new phone and just let it happen. Place is deceitful and wouldn't even bother to refund hundreds of dollars lost from this and will never use At&t ever again. Would recommend same to not use for others who use them.,0
"unacceptable in everyway $70 a month for complete trash that doesn't work.

"We were quoted $30 a line. The first bill was over $1,000! We were on the phone for 6 hours trying to correct it. Finally it was corrected and we were sent an email, because we had to request it, of what our monthly bill should be. Seven months later we still are not billed correctly. It constantly shift from $500-$800. We then call and spend hours on the phone to get it to $450.00 were it belongs. This company should be out of business.",0
This people are real thief’s  !  They sent me an email with an offer and their representative told me to wait a few days to take up on the offer ( maybe he didn’t want to do it at that moment) and to call back on Monday to get that taken care of. I spend all day Monday calling ATT and just kept getting transfer from place to place to than be told that the offer had expired  and there was nothing they could do about it. Even tho I missed the offer because their own employee provided me with the wrong information. This company does not look out for the long time costumer all they care about is the money. This will be the last month I spend with them.,0
"AT&T's service has been disappointing for me. I've experienced frequent outages and slow internet speeds that have made it difficult to work from home. Customer support has been challenging to reach, and when I do get through, the solutions offered don't seem to resolve my issues. Overall, I expected better reliability and responsiveness based on their reputation, but my experience has not met those expectations.",0
I started using AT&T prepaid a few months ago and it is the worst service I have ever used. I have to change. Logging in to pay is so ridiculous due to the switching between code and password and due to pw requirements. They try to force you to pay without signing in. There is no way to see payment history. My own mother can't even call. Customer service is terrible. Now i have to change providers AGAIN because of the issues.,0

NO LegsNO CarNO FamilyATT used to be a good place to do business.  I guess it's a direct reflection of this country.  For 6 weeks been begging for a way to return my old internet hardware only to be mistreated again and again.  Only trying to upsell me more service or lies.  Yet it sits with a threat of a $150 fee and sitting on my $35 credit.  On disability $35 is a weeks worth of groceries.  Nobody cares they think it's a joke to be disabled.,0
Spent an hour on the phone with a technical support rep Jospeh trying to troubleshoot my apple watch cellular plan. After not being able to resolve my issue he gave me the wrong phone number for advanced technical support. Spent a total of 4 hours on the phone with multiple different reps in an attempt to do a simple activation of an apple watch. Most masochistic experience of my life. I was respectful and patient the whole time and had a rep put me in hold purgatory.,0
"I have a landline, high speed internet and Directv. I can't do anything on att.com because no matter what I select, I am immediately redirected to directv. So if I wanted to pay the landline or internet, I can't. I've told them a hundred times for several years, they acknowledge it, but never do anything about it. This company must have the worst web designers and IT people on the planet. I pray that the cost of removing the underground lead cable and pension obligations puts them out of business. They do nothing to maintain infrastructure and their fancy fiber cable is coated in a peanut based material the squirrels just love to chew on. This is hands down the absolute worst American Company. Shameful and overpriced to the extreme for terrible customer service.",0
"My experience with AT&T has been nothing short of a nightmare. It began when they accessed my backyard without permission while I wasn’t home, and during this time, a laptop was stolen. Despite raising concerns, nothing was done about the theft—no compensation, no accountability.Fast forward about a year later, when I attempted to deny AT&T technicians access to the utility pole on my property due to a lack of easement. Instead of handling the matter professionally, the technician refused to leave when asked, and the situation escalated alarmingly: I was threatened with a gun and bullied on my own property.The police were contacted, and a report was filed. However, even after AT&T conducted an ""investigation,"" no meaningful action was taken. Their resolution? Terminating my service. This response felt more like retaliation than a solution.AT&T's handling of these incidents demonstrated an utter lack of accountability, professionalism, and respect for customer safety and property rights. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this company to anyone.",0
"rude employees who are not helpful in any way, shape, or form. i always make it a mission to be kind to any service employees but the associate in their mount pocono location might be the rudest woman i have ever encountered. i gave her no reason to speak to me in such a condescending tone.",0
Canceled the cell phone within the 30 day Costco period and is in collections for a 2 month service period. AT@T does not care and it shows,0
"With what was a good company has turned into a horrible one.  Five agents and five issues later, nothing has been resolved.  Having one agent ignore this customers plight and decide to place him back in line, really says it all.  No thank you, onto their competitor.",0
AT&T/Direct TV- Tried to cancel after my husband passed away and I could not afford it. They continued to charge me and added a third more on my next bill.  Many phone calls to try and correct it.  Then they called me offering me more deals.  Not listening to me and up charging me when I am already struggling.,0
1 star is too high. when you have a problem with A T and T's service and it is clearly their fault the solution is to say they are correcting the issue but it will result in you getting a higher bill. I thought Verizon was bad but this has gone to a new low. I have NEVER regretted using a service in my life as much as signing up this total rip off of a company.I would rather use smoke signals to communicate than pay them one more dime to get less than what I have paid for. I'm guessing data breaches and over charged accounts for services not rendered is their new norm.I Hope They Go Out Of Business,0
"5G is a SCAM. You’ll be lucky if you even get 3. I’m in the middle of the city and it RARELY loads anything. If you are deciding which service. DO NOT GO WITH AT&T!! They have spent more $ on marketing then actually improving their services. STOP PROMOTING 5G if we don’t get 5G. I have $ to spend so I tried each different plan. The only difference is hotspot/unlimited data into the bundle, but the speeds are STILL THE SAME. They lie and say they’re able to support 5G.",0
"I don't know how they still have customers. AT&T allows their reps to lie to customers. Our bill was astronomically higher than what was promised. We were charged for a phone that was supposed to be free with trade ins. Even with proof of all of this, customer service did nothing.They are perfectly fine with lying, scamming and stealing to get that contract. On top of all of that, the service is a joke. All that money and the phone barely works.I wish I would have read the reviews before taking that leap. Don't make the same mistake. Stay far away.",0
"AT&T has locked my cell phone and refuses to unlock it. Salesmen in-store and customer service failed to disclose to me their policy of requiring service for 6 months until after I purchased service with another carrier but couldn't use it because my phone was locked. This lack of disclosure about the 6-month service requirement has caused me significant distress and financial inconvenience. I meet the requirements listed on their website to unlock it. I requested an unlock but the male tech support refuses, was rude and he yelled at me. The store employees said I will have to purchase another wireless phone. I have a family and have been without cellular service for a week and customer service knew my intention to end prepaid service with AT&T and I've paid for service with another carrier but can't use it. It took hours to reach anyone and I had big problems initially starting service which should have been a red flag.",0
The promotion I used was to trade in your old phone from another carrier and get the new phones with At&t for free.  I did just that I even had to jump through hoops to send in my old phones.  I am on my 6th bill and still paying for the new phones.  The excuse is they are still processing my return.  I wish I never switched over.  I am now paying  $350 a month for 3 phones and the service sucks as well.,0
"The worst customer service from store managers to call center.  I have been attempting for months to get a billing issue resolved and they will not even allow you to speak with anyone that can help.  They claim that a case is created for a manager to review, however no one ever follows up.  Very disappointing service.",0
"I have been trying to unlock one of my cell phones that I purchased at AT&T. The unlock was entered incorrectly and there is a network lock. I have been waiting over 5 days for this to get fixed only to find out today I will need to get to an at&t store to get a sims card to enter the unlock code. they could have told me that on Monday but waited until now. I have canceled my account with them. And I will be billed a full months service + a cancellation fee. This is a very bad company to do any business with. They are ruthless, unelthical, immoral and shameless. Once they are in your pockets ... it takes a lot of patience to remove their hands! One important piece of advise: never ever take a sales persons information as having any credibilty from at&t or any other provider. They will lie to you and find excuses - I think they provide the staff with a list to use.",0
"I submitted a warranty claim on 11/21/24 for a replacement phone. The phone was shipped and lost during shipping.  I called Asurion again on 11/26/24 to check on the status of the shipment. They told me it was lost and shipped a replacement.  I called back again on 12/3/24 to check on the status of my replacement.  Asurion told me once again that the shipment was lost during shipping.  I finally spoke with a Supervisor who finally got me my replacement device.  However, I learned that I had been charged a $250 deductible on each of the previous replacement shipments.  The Supervisor advised me that I would only be charged the one original deductible and the other two deductibles would be credited to my account.  I get my Nov-Dec bill and it turns out I was still charged the other deductibles.  I call Asurion and they say I have to call AT&T for the refund on the refunds.  I call AT&T and they say I have to call Asurion.  This back-and-forth has been going on since 12/3/24.  I called Asurion and AT&T on 1/8/25 and they said they would issue a refund. It should only take 7 to 10 business days.  I call Asurion on 1/19/25 to check on the status of my refund and they state that AT&T can only issue the refund.  I call AT&T on 1/19//25 and they state I can only get my refund from Asurion.  I tried to speak with a Supervisor for both companies and each one disconnected the calls.  I was billed over $700 on my bill.  AT&T refused to transfer my call to a Supervisor on multiple attempts on 1/19/25.  First attempt I held for 20 minutes and was disconnected.  Second attempt, I was holding for 40 minutes before being disconnected.  On the third attempt, the agent refused to transfer the call to a Supervisor and hung up on me!  Do NOT get a warranty from Asurion and /AT&T.",0
"I cancelled the company's business phone service with ATT April 2024, then saw a bill for a credit of $6k. Instead of receiving a check, I later received another bill for $2k. Turns out, they switched the account number from my old one to a new one, and were paying the bills with the credit that was left over. Now, not only do they not want to refund the credit but they want me to pay $3k. They are claiming that number was tied to our account, but if it was, when I cancelled, why didn't they cancel it as well? Why did they switch the account number from the old phone number to this new phone number. I was speaking to customer service, and when I made that statement, the lady hung up on me or something because she was no longer on the line.",0
"I was lied to be a ATT&T employee at a store when told about a promotion. He said we would not have any additional lines added to the bill, and it would only be a few dollars more a month for new devices (apple watch/ipad that I didn't even want, I went in to upgrade my phones). When I saw my bill and called the store even confirmed he no longer worked there because he did this to other people. Anyway, they debited $500 from my account in additional fees, and my plan went up over $100 a month for lines I don't use. Now I've spent hours on the phone trying to get a refund and cancel the phone lines and they are sending me in circles without correcting anything. I filed a fraud complaint that was denied because the representative helping didn't understand the situation either. Huge waste of money and time. Not mentioning details is one thing, but to lie to my face with no accountability is insane. Very bad business & customer service.",0
"Setting up as a new customer and transferring from another carrier, I selected a plan and ordered a phone. Order was confirmed, $$$ deducted from my bank account (set up auto-pay for additional discount), yet no correspondence received had any information on how to set up a way to access my AT&T account, therefore no way to log in, etc. Numerous emails and jumping through hoops attempting to initiate the Signature Program through my employer, a major university where I’ve worked over 15 years, which discount was denied, I called AT&T customer service and was transferred numerous times, finally landing with the rudest rep I have ever encountered. They insisted I must have set up an account with a passcode  for the order to go through, despite my insistence I did not do so - I only provided my email, phone number, SS#, address, etc., online on their website. I have a MacBook which saves every account and password created and have nothing stored. They continued to berate me when I requested the order be cancelled stating they couldn’t since the account wasn’t active. All the red flags are going off and I will not be doing business with this company after this frustrating experience.",0

WRONG. My bill ended up increasing by over $50. Representative straight up lied to me about the plan and bill charges…I guess to just get the sales. Anyhow, I have since cancelled my ATT internet and now have ported my number over to a new company. Paid off my $1500 iPad so I could move that service as well to the new company. Money is not the object, it is the principle of what happened and how it was done.

The prices they charge for this and what you get in return should be federally illegal and punishable by public humiliation for 6 business days straight. Don’t waste your time on this dogshit, it might as well be a god damn scam",0
AT&T’s Internet and service is horrible.  We have had off and on service since before Christmas and today it’s off again.  According to them it’s a fiber issue and they’ve be working it since December 23.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable AND they decided to give us a $5 credit.  We work from home and this inconvenience is far more than $5 and over multiple days.  I’ve been with AT&T well over 30 years and it has significantly declined over the years.  Their service is horrible and unreliable.  I’ll be looking into another service today.,0
"They told me my on the would be 70$ on the 8th of January smh come to find out they charged me 125$ instead of the 70 and said it was due on the 2nd well after they read the agreements too me, these people are scammers  DO NOT DO business with them . You never reach anyone from customer service , it’s always atleast an hour most like because of more complaints that they’re receiving , terrible company .",0
"BEWARE of AT&T bait and switch tactics are becoming infamous for if you read on Google. I have twice now been bait and switched on two different promos. I’m a long-term 15 year customer with multiple lines. i’ve noticed there’s recent lawsuits on this bait and switch tactic also recently so I guess I’m not the only one who’s experiencing this. One was an advertise special in an AT&T store for $20 for an additional line which they didn’t honor and ended up after I went to the BBB speaking with their so-called office of the president. What a joke to resolve their reason for not honoring it the store shouldn’t have been advertising the promo. It was not going on, but yet they take no accountability. Number two promo was upgrade your iPhone with trade-in, my spouse and I did this. They honored mine and not my spouses continuing to charge him full price every month, not giving him the credit that he was supposed to get for his turned in device. I have fought with them over this for over a year through the BBB and the so-called office of the president again it’s a joke this office of the president reps have lied to me each time I talk to them about the resolution there never was a resolution, and they lie in states there were. any problems with your AT&T bill can never be handled with customer service at AT&T because every employee is not educated and tells you a different story and tells you they can’t handle it. You then have to go to the BBB who is very good about submitting the complaint with them and AT&T contact you back right away through the so-called office of the president which totally lies to you and tells you they’ll resolve it. It has been a nightmare for over a year and a half and they have cost me thousands of dollars taking advantage of hard-working people who only take advantage of the promo. and then our bait and switched this should be illegal and they have no accountability. I’m now being forced to take them to court. i would suggest steer clear of AT&T as they literally lie to make money off you.",0
The absolute worst. Inexplicable charges and fees constantly. I am so glad to be done with this horrible company.,0
"Att store at costa mesa3711 S Bristol, Ste 104, Santa Ana, CA 92704We recently opened a new line and specifically requested that AT&T Next be added to the account. Unfortunately, it wasn’t added as requested. I called the store spoke to Ana who initially helped us and assured us to that if we came back to the store, look for the store manager Edgar, they would take care of it.On New Year’s Day, we made the hour-long drive, only to be told by Edgar that it was now past the 14-day window and they could no longer add it. If he had properly addressed the issue in the first place, we wouldn’t have wasted our time and effort.This manager displayed poor customer service, refused to take accountability for the mistake, and left us deeply frustrated by the lack of resolution. We switched to at&t for this poor service. It’s so sad!",0
They don't look out for there costumes it's all about the money be paying for 2 years on time lost my job out of work for 3 months they don't care please don't go to them they boss don't care either been on the phone with them all day,0
"If I could pick 0 stars I would,  but it isnt available.  Their customer service is terrible.  They dont listen when you tell them you have issues.  I plan to run,  not walk away from AT&T for good.  All they care about is the almightly dollar.  BUYER BEWARE.  Their current rating doesnt surprise me.",0
I have been going through this with AT&t home service and my phone service at my home -NO SERVICE!  my landline it has been out since August of 2024 and today is January 19th 2025. When you call at & t keeps coming up with different excuses stating that it was restored but some customers are still not restored they refuse to send anyone out to your home to investigate. And on top of that they have the nerve to send you bills as if your service is still remaining I have no wireless service I have to spend more money to go do my job elsewhere I'm not being compensated about this I've contacted corporate who does not care this is a billion dollar company and if people are still in copper are you really trying to tell us in Los Angeles that you don't have the money to prevent this this is absurd I'm very disappointed and would like everyone to know do not become a new customer of AT&t because they don't care about their customers they'll give you a date and then they'll call you back if they call you back and push the date back and back and back and back and then you have to call to be recompensated for the money that you have on your books as a credit already because they're taking it as if I'm getting service do not use AT&t they're disgusting despicable in the world needs to know this. I still do not have service and this is 2025. No internet no wireless no home landline service AT&t you are a disaster! Living in the urban community perhaps that's the reason is it racism is it that they don't give a dang what is it are they trying to get us to buy a different brand to manipulate us with no service there's many questions but no answers all the copper has been stolen that's you know it's it's too many excuses we don't care about that at this point we want it restored or there should be a lawsuit in the near future!,0
"AT&T has been installing fiber in our neighborhood for the past few months. They were at our neighbors and installing service for them. THEY TRENCHED IN OUR YARD AND CUT OUR INTERNET CABLE!! We have Xfinity. I called AT&T and was told they can not come out and fix since it is not their equipment!! WTH!! So now we have no services! NO INTERNET, WI FI, TV, SECURITY CAMERAS!!! I had to take action MYSELF and call Xfinity to set up a tech appointment so they can come out and fix. What type of INCOMPETENT AND CARELESS techs does AT&T have working for them!!!!! And to think, we were considering switching services from Xfinity to AT&T fiber. Hahaha!!",0
Constantly telling me I’m grandfathered into a plan but that while it is still the same I pay significantly more than I originally agreed to with no actual benefits.  Service is getting progressively worse with dead spots all over the city and support can’t even answer basic questions.  After over a decade of decline it has finally reached a point where I’m actually looking into the very few other options seriously even though moving carriers is a hassle.,0
"For the love of humanity and god, Do not ever choose ATT. They are open criminals and will do anything to siphon money from you. I thought ATT was a big company and they had millions of cell towers so they must be good. But I made the mistake of not checking trustpilot.. They have 1 star overall review which is INSANE. Do yourself a favor and go with Usmobile, mint mobile,redpocket, or Tmobile. They would not let me cancel my port request, wouldn't let me cancel my service, and they ship you out a ESIM instead of emailing you it.",0
They will rip you off stating they never received payment then you show proof and they still want to hit you with a late fee. You ask to speak to a manager because the first agent is being rude then the manager Julia is also rude and smartallic. Do not go with this service. Metro has a better plan.,0
"Absolutely garbage phone service and the customer service is way worse than anyone could imagine. Have insurance on our phones and were told we still have to pay $200 to have the glass fixed.No point in doing business with this company based on what I've mentioned and when you add in how many data leaks they've had, it's beyond comprehension how they are still in business.",0
Beware of this company. They are not secure in anyway on their MyATT app. Mine got hacked and a double payment was made. One being authorized and another not. They will make you pay for their mistake. They will not correct it either. Their customer service is pathetic. They don’t care about their customers they didn’t through Covid either. I received a letter in the mail about my information being compromised and that they believed no personal information was stolen but explain to me how an unauthorized payment was made. Done go to T-Mobile for service they are by far AMAZING,0
AT&T has horrible customer service-wait times 1-1/2 hours. Can u believe an agent referred me to their Spectrum competitor? Have chronic problem w 3-4 technicians out and STILL not fixed. After being a 25 year client we r thinking of switching. What a bloody and stressful mess. Horrible!,0
Att waited till brother passed away and sent a bogus bill to collections. He cancelled his service after paying his bill went to TMobile to get better charges and after a month he passed away. Att never sent a bill or nothing. Then sent a bogus bill to collections and then sent a letter to lawyer to delay probate. This service is not professional or caring. Would not recommend Att to anyone!,0
I have to gave att one star or less. Don’t trust any of them from sales representative when they ask you for promotion from att to get discount from current bill. The sales representative was cheating me. I did call att to ask them why my bill higher last couple month bill after sale representative told me att had promotions discount to customer if add one more phone line from my account.I spoke with representative customer service your guys were cheating with customer today.Don’t trust them and I am going change another provider.,0
Phone support is available after an hour wait at which time the untrained agent will need to transfer you (another 45 minutes) to the next bozo who will waste another 40 minutes of your time before finally telling you to call again tomorrow. The att goal is to tire you out until you quit trying to get the problem resolved. The worst support in the industry. Every other carrier is better than att.,0
"Do I have to give a star.The worst service ever, Sales person after agreement wouldn’t return a single call, Calling support, bounced from one department to another, go over the whole issue time and time again, sorry you need to call this department, nope I can’t resolve let me give you the right department, sorry you need to contact this department…... After 2 months of countless calls and countless hours on the phone with them, the internet has never worked. We had to switch back to our old provider which went seamlessly to get by, resulting in us doubling our costs thinking we might get this resolved. . Apparently they have no technicians to visit and resolve issues they can’t resolve over the phone. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",0
DO NOT TRADE-IN YOUR PHONE AT AT&T as i was a 3 years in happy customer i hated it after what happened and i’ll just pay it off and switch to some other company.what happens is recently i traded in my 14 Pro max 512 GB for a 16 Pro max 256 Gb and to be honest with you i had some cracks at the back of the phone but they gave me $830 estimated price for rhe phone at the store and they said my charges would be $11 for the new phone and i took the deal.After i traded-in i called them and they told me the screen wasn’t turning on and off so they revalued my old phone and gave me $400 in credits instead of $830 and i can truly say even if i would sell it i would’ve took $800 so they robbed me by $400 and they only paid $400 for my old phone and when i asked my phone back they told me the policy and terms that i signed up won’t allow me to get it back.There was nothing wrong with the screen they made this to make extra bucks on me and they are probably doing it to a lot of people and making extra millions of dollars by this.Just wanted to let everybody know.I would’ve gave 0 stars if there was an option,0
"dog shit of an fiber service and billing department, every month I had to call loyal department for them to manually adjust my billing because the ticket they submitted for me has yet to be resolved.",0
We have been double charged insurance for our phones. We asked for a credit for the thousands we paid over the last few years and they only want to give us $100.I wonder how many customers they are currently taking advantage of. ATT is making millions from fraudulent charges.,0
"DO NOT GET ATT! Their fraud department flagged my account for no reason, then denied me adding a line.  and refused to tell me why. I have my bill on auto pay and have never missed it, I have excellent credit and make great money. There is no reason to treat a 16 year customer this way. I will be seeking other alternatives for cell phone service.",0
"I am On Auto pay and updated my credit card.They continued to charge my expired card ( which I had removed from my acct.) and sent me an email that I owed 306.00 and was going to have my service shut off. Ernesto,the customer service Rep, was rude and unhelpful.",0
"Consistently poor Internet. Drops out frequently, ATTs own speed test shows they are delivering 20% of the promised speed. Spoke with their ""support"" group multiple times and they are rude, refused to escalate and last time put me on hold for 34 minutes and came back to say they'd call back. That was 2 weeks ago and no call. I'd switch to any other provider, but att is the only option on our road. If you have ANY other options use them.",0
Bill had been 55 a month for four years. Randomly increased to 130 and paid that on Nov 20. Suddenly received another bill for 130 stating if I don’t pay before the 9th then they’ll cut service. I scheduled three calls on the 8th with no call backs and they cut my service at midnight despite me checking my billing history and my bill isn’t due until Dec 20. Can’t get a hold of anyone until tomorrow night and it’s finals week and I have no internet. Honestly kind of ridiculous.,0
"Called customer support for an extension on scheduled payment for a week cause my Medicare advantage flex card arrives by Dec 1st & I have no other funds. They said no. So I won’t be able to stay in contact in case of a crisis with my dr, pharmacy, medical transport or dialysis clinic. I will in 2 months be leaving ATT after my iPhone is paid off to bundle services with xfinity. At least they have empathy.",0
"It was impossible to get through to an actual agent.  After being in voicemail hell for what seemed like an hour, I finally got a link to chat.  Finally, I thought - at least I can get a chat discussion.  Just as the agent  restated what I was trying to explain, the chat disappeared.  SO that was another 20 minutes.  I never was able to solve the problem.",0
0 stars.  Salesman  over phone are blatant liars… trying to milk you for every penny. absolutely lied to time and again.Then we get our bill and have  all sorts of new non discussed add on charges. Obvious fraud!Wasted my time over a hour on phone then wait for our phones to be mailed. Now we get to return them and switch carriers to probably another money grubbing company. But I will never use AT&T again.Know the advertised deals going on or the will take advantage of you.If we did this equivalent as consumers we would be jailed. Complete con artist . Reviews do no good. They need a huge law suit for lying to customers. Class action anyone !!,0
When your internet is out all day and your scheduled time in the evening is screwed up by AT &T and then you can’t get it repaired until 2 full days later. What sort of service is that!! Paying $90 ish a month for below average service and average internet with regularly dropped zoom calls. I will be looking at other options,0
"Our area was extremely hard hit by hurricane helene.  My 90 year old mother was without power for 21 days and without a home phone from Sept 27 to Dec 17.  She paid over $90 per month for the landline service.  She's had the same phone number for over 68 years.  AT&T initially announced they would be issuing credits for people in the area because of interruption of service.  In late December I called to check on her credit which should have been a little over $250.   I was offered $130 and then $200 or I could call back with the dates that I reported the service.  They said they had no record of us calling to report the outage.  I repled it was a hurricane, your lines were completely down.  When I called back with the dates I had reported it, I was told there was no record of me calling the first time today.",0
"AT&T is trying to scam people. When you first get an AT&T line, their customer service is friendly, and they offer you a good price. However, once you receive your first bill, you'll be shocked. They charge various taxes that seem unreasonable, such as communication tax, 911 charges, and state tax. It feels like you went to buy a beer, and then they suddenly ask for licensing fees, food and beverage tax, resale certificate fees, and company registration fees, among others. Be careful don't go with them.",0
"If I could give a lower rating I would.  AT&T is the absolute worst mobile carrier.  Service is slow and nonexistent most of the time and way overpriced.  But the customer service,  that is the real downfall.  AT&T customer service has to be the worst.  They refuse management, refuse call backs, hang up on callers and take an excessive amount of time with transfers.  Don't try to get anything resolved ever, that doesn't happen with AT&T.  I spent 6 hours trying to fix an order AT&T screwed up and nothing was fixed.  I was told I have to place and pay for a new order and dispute previous charges for an order AT&T f'd up.  Thanks for the lack of customer service!",0
"I have never in my life had any interaction with ATT wireless until my new company issued me a new Iphone 2 months ago.  The charging slot will not hold a cable.  I wanted to see if the store had the ability to repair the phone, but that was not to be.I tried for 20 minutes to break through their customer firewalls to get a human, but they engineer their firewalls for maximum time wastage and frustration.So F you immensely ATT, and your profoundly shitty service.  I am now obligated to drive to a store to be ignored there.",0
I have been with AT&T for over 12 years.  I recently lost my job due to medical issues and I'm currently going through chemo.  So I have been making payment arrangements so I paid my past due bill of 290.00 and they advise me I had to make another payment of 234.00 by Dec 14 and can't assist me with a extension.  I understand that there running a business but if I'm loyal to you why kick me while I'm down. I have other bills with no income.  I'm so disgusted with this company.,0
"My bill has doubled because of a mistake made by AT&T and they refuse to help in anyway. Customer service, Martin, with AT&T found this mistake and explained to me what happened and how they believe it happened by an employee in the store when we upgraded my daughter’s phone. But instead of correcting the error they tell me to continue paying the huge bill. They refuse to put me back on the plan that I was happy with for 16 years and are forcing me to now pay 433$ a month instead of my previous 200$ monthly bill! I am furious!",0
"ATT/DIRECTVI COULDN'T BE MORE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR SERVICE.  YOU DON'T DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR. AFTER THE NIGHTMARE TO GET INTERNET AND TV SERVICES, I WOULD NEVER RECOMEND YOU TO ANYONE.  FROM YOUR SALES PERSONAL TO YOUR SUPPORT HELP.  YOU ALL DESERVE A ZERO.  ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SINCE THIS NIGHTMARE STARTED DEC. 20TH HAVE GIVEN ME THE PROPER SUPPORT I NEEDED.  I INFORMED THEM I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE I HAD RECEIVED SO FAR.  I NORMALLY DON'T WRITE REVIEWS BUT AFTER THIS EXPERENCE I HAD TO.  AFTER 38 EMAILS AND 7 TEXT MESSAGES, THATS NOT COUNTING THE ONES I DELETED, AND BEING ON HOLD FOR OVER 4 HOURS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, I FINALLY GOT SERVICE WORKING.  I TRIED TO FIND ON YOUR WEBSITE WHERE I CAN WRITE A REVIEW.  I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND IT.  I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AFTER BEING ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES AND REQUESTING A CALL BACK THAT TOOK OVER 30 MINUTES TO RECEIVE I SPOKE TO SOME FOREIGN PERSON WHO I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, I WAS TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER FOREIGN PERSON I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.  I ASKED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO SPOKE PROPER ENGLISH.  I NEVER GOT TO THAT PERSON.  SINCE THEN I HAVE CALLED THE SALES PERSON WHO SOLD ME THE GARBAGE INTERNET/TV SERVICE AND TOLD THEM TO CANCEL MY SERVICE AND TO COME PICK THEIR EQUIPMENT UP.  EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN ALRIGHT ACCEPT FOR YOUR TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  TOM FROM ROCKFORD, ILL. IS THE ONE PERSON WHO REALLY HELP ME THE MOST.  HE DESERVES 5 STARS.  IF ANYONE FROM ATT/DIRECTV WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT ME, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO.",0
"Used to like them until they discontinued my Internet service. I decided to move to another Internet provider April 2023  they continued to bill me for almost a year after I discontinued service. They stole money off my credit card and when I finally cut off my credit card to prevent more fraudulent charges they sent me to collections. The worst customer service, stole  money for service not received..Beware !!!!!",0
"For all first responders; stay away from AT&T and don’t be fooled by their First Net promises. Especially if you live in rural areas. Their coverage is horrible, customer service is nonexistent and cost will continue to climb year after year. My experience with them has been a nightmare and I am switching providers. Never will I return nor recommend them to anyone",0
"WARNING - AT&T offers deplorable customer service, setting up two account, getting itself completely confused. Double billing me, taking multiple payments.What a NIGHTMARE. I suggest you stay away from this utterly incompetent company",0
"This company is the worst  I change from Verizon  5 lines to get better deal and international deal they told me is going to be $15 dallar for extra line what is was good deal no signal en ecuador bad signal and they send me bill for 1 month $10,000.00 dallar is ridiculous  now theySend to credit report",0
"When I had the phone transfered to my name...the rep just did a transfer of financial responsablity. So when I went in 4 days later to get it all moved over as it should have been I told them I wanted to keep my new number. That was fine, but what they did was basically give me 2 acct for 1 phone. So even though I'm paying my bill on time, there was another acct I didn't know about. That acct got shut down for no payment then they hit me with a 1400 dollar bill with my device on it. They basically said sorry there is nothing we can do ...how do you want to pay this....for their screw up",0
"I hate ATT! I left Tmobile because of their terrible customer service. They are stellar compared to ATT. Everyone i spoke to told me something different. Supervisors have no authority to do anything.  I spoke to one rep for one hour and 55 minutes and two days later they refused to honor exception she promised. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CURRENT CARRIER, YOU WILL REGRET IT. I cant wait to get out of this contract.",0
"Att is absolutely garbage,  customer service the worst,  coverage really bad! I have the unlimited plan and I have no data most of the time,  really is time for a change after more than 8 years,  completely disappointed!!@",0
These guys suck absolute ass. Does not matter how many bars you have your service will always be dogshit. Not consistent whatsoever.,0
Horrible! Crooks! You have services and when services interrupted you are still required to pay for something you were unable to use. Both my landline and internet have been put for OVER a month and yet I'm still billed. More then likely will be canceling the landline and looking for another internet service provider! My internet rate just went up another $5! I'm looking to email Elon musk and vivek ramaswamy to see if they can look into att and pge in California! Been with att for a very long time but no more!!!,0
"I had to chose 1 star to star a review, in reality they deserve 0 or a minus.Worst company I have ever been affiliated with.  Can't wait till my contract is up to get the hell out.They are sharks and will try to charge you for stuff they did not even provide.Think twice before switching to ATT",0
"I was trying to take advantage of the plans through Costco offering new phones signed up for him, and after four hours at the kiosk and talking to multiple customer service reps at their 833 number I was ready to throw all the phones through one of the TVs at Costco. Worst customer service ever, I was hopeful after 17 year hiatus from AT&T. Their customer service has improved. It’s only gotten worse. Do not do business with them.",0
"At&t has been steadily increasing my home internet bill for the past months. They are constantly sending notifications about getting air internet which I refuse. For the first 2 years with them, the line was bad because of faulty installment on their part, until they rewire. They didn't compensate me for the loss and I let it slip but yet they are increasing my bill basically every month.",0
"The AT&T that is at Costco is a HUGE Scam. They will tell you ANYTHING to get you to join their service. We traded in our own PAID OFF (new) phones, to get new ""free"" phones. When the new iPhone came out we wanted to gift our phones to someone and buy new phones, they charged us $1200 each phone which means we got ZERO value for the phones we gave them. ALL because they FAILED to tell us the conditions that came with the phones. They just wanted us to get to sign the contract. I AM BEYOND disappointed. The customer service was nice but they literally did NOTHING.",0
"I paid my brothers phone bill until his death on Sunday. I asked ATT to cancel that line. Kelly was extremely helpful and courteous. I upgraded my phones last June and the young man added another line to my account that was at no additional cost to me. I decided to cancel that line as well. Problem was he attached the installment plan for my upgraded phone to the new number. ATT will not attach the installment to my original phone number so to cancel that line I have to pay the phone off ($555.00). Lesson learned, ATT just sucks and I would advise you not to use them. You’re welcome.",0
WISH I COULD GIVE A MINUS REVIEW. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,0
I would give zero Stars if I could this company is scamming. their fees are outrageous and they're not detailed whatsoever they completely get you on late fees and reconnection fees 2 months after you had thought bill was paid in full they are completely unclear and they lie when you talk to them through service,0
"Already regretting about changing to AT&T. They offered me a bundle credit and trade in credits but what no one told me was that credits appeared 2-3 billing cycles after, so I’ll be paying way more money for that than what I originally agreed to pay until the credits are applied, who knows when. Don’t fall for it !!!",0
"’ve been a loyal AT&T customer for over 15 years, but my recent experience has left me deeply disappointed. I participated in a phone trade-in program for $700, only to find out a few days later that the trade-in value for my phone had increased to $830. When I reached out to customer service to request an adjustment, I was met with a flat refusal to honor the updated trade-in value.What made the situation even more frustrating was the lack of willingness to escalate my concern. The representatives I spoke with were unhelpful and outright refused to transfer me to another department or supervisor who might have been able to assist.After more than a decade of loyalty, I expected AT&T to value its customers enough to provide fair consideration for situations like this. Sadly, their rigid policies and poor customer service have shown me otherwise. I am now seriously reconsidering my long-term relationship with AT&T.",0
"Worst telephone company, and dishonest. After decades of being a customer I finally changed carrier.Tired of dishonest charges, and the terrible customer service the client ends up paying for. And, it only keeps getting more and more expensive for its unreliable services.If I could give a no star I would.When I called to close my account, I was not told, ATT doesn’t prorate. I just found out today they will keep the money for 3 weeks of prepaid service on a closed account.Shame on them.Just like they read all their promotion scripts to clients, they could have more respect for us, and also read conditions and results to the changes we are considering, before we make a final decision.But then again, that ends up costing us more money, but making  ATT  even more easy money. Sickening.",0
AT and T customer call services have been awful. They promise one thing only to find out they are not able to fulfill an over the verbal promise. Their charges for returning the phone which was supposed to lower my monthly bill only to be charged 638.00 in separate charges within 3 days don't even know what once they recieved my card# - I have been with them for over 3 years .  They dropped the ball and can't believe they can do this and get away with it for now. Just awful !This is an update: I did leave AT and T and yesterday they refunded me the shipping fee of 130.00 they charged me.,0
"AT&T experienced several data breaches compromising customer information.  3 days following one such breach, an account was opened in my name without my knowledge or permission.  I explained this to customer service and they had me fill out a form and file a police report.  Nevertheless, they denied the form and said I was still responsible for payment! They sent it to collections and have not removed it.  AT&T has permamently lost my busuness and I highly recommend avoiding business with this company.",0
"We have been customers of AT&T wireless for years, but due to the high charges for AT&T we opted to go to another carrier. It took 4 phone calls to AT&T, with numerous persons, and many lies on AT&T's part. We finally contacted our new carrier explaining that AT&T would not unlock our cell phones (which we own!!). Once contacted by our new carrier AT&T shut off our service with no notice. I have congestive heart failure, so AT&T's lack of customer service and shutting down our cell phones was unacceptable and medically dangerous to me!!!  I urge anyone thinking of using AT&T to go somewhere else and use any other company!!! AT&T is lucky we are not contacting an attorney regarding the phone turn off, when our account is paid out for another 2 weeks!!!!",0
"Att completely misrepresented there policy. We switched to att and we're given free phones , however they were not free and upon upgrade we had to pay over $100 to pay off our free phone. This was unexpected and a hardship as we live on ss. If I had been informed we would have never switched, now we're screwed for another 18 months. I advise not to do business with att and and avoid there deception.",0
Cancelled internet. They will not pro rate the bill. Cell phone service also sucks,0
"I've never had any other service than AT&T, my landline back in the day with Bell Telephone, then it changed to AT&T... We're talking forever ago.  No more, switched to T-Mobile and was made a happy customer the first day.  Sick of the dishonest business tactics and overcharges almost monthly with AT&T.",0
"Stay away from AT&T and FIRSTNET. Horrible. They disconnect my number by mistake of AT&t and took me over 10 days reconnect. HORRIBLE. Their agents don’t know nothing , just know say: “ sorry about your situation but we can’t do nothing “ ( In 10 days period I talked with almost 25 Agents from all their service departments, and nobody can’t do nothing about their own mistake. -STAY AWAY FROM AT&T-",0
"AT&T required my 95-year-old mother with dementia to come down to the store to authenticate her ID simply to activate a new SIM card because she misplaced her phone.    Even though the store employees said, I could do it over the phone, AT&T customer service, In all of their wisdom, required them to send an authentication code to her phone. The lost phone!! They would not do it through email. They verified her Social Security number. They spoke with her on the phone. But they’re still going to require her to come down to the store for a new SIM card. Until then she has no phone. I will never use AT&T.",0
Unbelievably bad. Tried to do a simple transfer of billing responsibility to move off my sister’s account. My sister completed the TOBR and I was told twice that it was completed. But no transfer. Called for the 4th time and customer service now says they cannot see the TOBR and I will have to start the process for the third time. Absolutely ridiculous.  Total wast of my time (3hours!!). Hopefully three times is the charm. Do better ATT!!!!!!!,0
This company is a liar and dishonest and has no honor in business. They said that I could upgrade my phone for free and would only have to pay an $11 difference to get a 512GB phone since my previous phone was 128GB. Then after a month they discounted it over the phone and I will not be able to cancel the contract because they set me to pay in 36 installments. My experience with this company was very unpleasant because I felt like an idiot for trusting this unscrupulous company.,0
Worst customer service ever !!! We are switching back to t mobile.  The service is good they cost less . Good coverage.  At&t is just expensive for nothing.,0
"Absolutely horrendous. I ordered new phones for me and my brother and got a significant holiday discount, but it was delivered 3 days during the work week, but it requires a signature, so I obviously missed all 3 days because I'm at work. Due to this, our phones were sent back to where they were shipped from. I called both AT&T and UPS and both told us there is nothing we can do. The AT&T agent I spoke with even was placing the blame on me for not being home. I am at WORK in the middle of the day. I have zero way of being home if I am working. Some of the worst customer service dealt with, and now I have to start the ordering process all over again. If you are thinking of getting a new phone through AT&T, please reconsider.",0
"Did an upgrade with ATT online after the local store was out of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. It was shipped by RLC today via Fedex. It requires a signature and every restriction possible. Fedex says ATT needs to call them to allow holding it at the local Walgreens, but ATT says they can't do that. Fedex also doesn't allow the option to deliver at a time when I'll be home. I work all day from 8-5pm. I've told both Fedex and ATT that they can cancel my order and ship the item back. I will not sign the door tag to have it left at my residence. The ATT rep was very nice I talked to, but this is a systemic failure by both ATT and Fedex. UPS is great and I've never had issues with them. I'd switch to another carrier, but unfortunately, ATT is the only carrier with service where I live. Fedex is a complete joke and I avoid them like the plaque. There is a reason UPS delivers more packages then them.",0
"I am beyond frustrated with AT&T's customer service. They seem to be deliberately delaying everything, making even the simplest tasks unnecessarily difficult. No matter what issue I have, it takes forever to get a resolution. The lack of communication and helpfulness from their support team is infuriating. It feels like they don't care about their customers at all. The culture at AT&T seems focused on creating obstacles rather than finding solutions. I would not recommend this company to anyone based on my experience. They make everything harder than it should be.",0
"Sent my son in Western Blvd, Jacksonville NC store to purchase a iPhone 16. I told him no contracts, fees, just buy it, Merry Christmas! Associate said it’s a FREE upgrade! Being a new consumer he did not understand how AT&T is grossly misrepresented aka lie. I went back in the store the same day to cancel. Associate said it must be the manager and she is busy, it’s going to be a while. I said fine, how else can I cancel? Call 611. I called on my way home -and they were closed until Monday. I went online to view order and cancel. (Help said there will be a cancel button if it hadn’t shipped and it was the same day hours after the order and it hadn’t shipped. I continued to check for the button.) The next day 8am CST I texted on my app to cancel = reply sorry can’t help you, I called 611 and waited 20-30 minutes = reply sorry can’t help you. They said call the local store, the associate said you must come in and speak to the manager. Easy to purchase, very difficult to cancel. Reminds me a lot of the old Gym memberships when the Gym made it very difficult to cancel, time consuming, and there was a fee. Now I have to receive the iPhone and return it and there is Restocking fee. I thought I did my due diligence to cancel, ordered Sunday 2pm. I went back to the store the next day (29th) Monday on Western Blvd and the manager CANNOT CANCEL it. According to AT&T, NO ONE in the universe can stop the phone from shipping, the store, the texting line or any leadership at AT&T. GOOD NEWS this inspired me to quit overpaying for services, $110 mo for 2 lines (w/discounts) changed to $30 a month same features. Perspective- Annual savings $960, over a decade $10,000.",0
Horrible service they suck and don’t let u buy nothing they make my life hell and canceling my service as soon as possible because of there messed  up service,0
"AT&T has nowhere to file a complaint and BBB won’t let you either because they are not accredited with the BBB. I have spent over 1 hour trying. Their customer service is the worse ever because it doesn’t exist. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone unless you like not being able to talk to anyone unless you are trying to set up service. If you set up service get ready to be engorged on everything.They don’t give a crap about customer service. If you don’t believe me just try yourself. I don’t know how they stay in business. Trust me, you will be sorry if you sine up with them.",0
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICEMy home was destroy during the storm in September, a tree fell on my roof.I called to cancel the service and I was instructed to pay the month and returned the equipment. Two months later I had to call back to cancel the service again, this time they wanted me to pay 2 months to cancel, they said there’s no record o notes of the cancellation, I had a record of UPS for the returned equipment and record of the call and they still wanted to pay,It was a natural disaster and we still working on rebuilding our home, these people don’t care about their customers. They just Don’t care at all.",0
Had to call the help line 6+ times to get a fan pin number. They provided several different pin numbers that were incorrect and seemed to have no idea what they were doing.,0
"I had to click the 1 star just to be able to leave a review, but I wouldn't give them this much credit! Leo, the representative that I had the misfortune of speaking with, was incredibly rude and very hostile. I work in a call center myself and I have NEVER in my life dealt with someone who was so unprofessional! If he was not hacking in the phone, he was cutting me off and telling me ""Just go to the store"". I had told him multiple times I went to the store for the same issue and the store clerk told me they were not able to assist me because it has to be done through the customer service line. I have been a loyal customer of AT&T for 15 years, but I will no longer be using them. HORRIBLE!!!!",0
"I've been without internet since Christmas Eve.  While AT&T employees were at home enjoying their internet, paying customers were at home WITHOUT working internet.  AT&T is not communicating with customers regarding restoration times.  I'm paying for internet service that I cannot use.",0
"This company is a good example of the oligarchies that are bringing this country to its knees. It is all about money, not customer service or quality.IF they let you talk to an agent (and it's nearly impossible), they employ overseas ESL agents you can barely understand and, though they're SUPER ready to add additional services, their internal communication sucks so bad that your bill is always messed up and separated.They sold me on internet, spent 45 minutes on the phone with me, and then sent me only part of the equipment I needed and told me to set up myself.",0
"I've had AT&T mobile for 19 years. Since I was 17 years old. I didn't know any better then. Now, having had multiple screw ups at a store with upgrades, unauthorized plan changes, or always some new hidden fee with a ""free upgrade"" that was not disclosed up front. I'm both a Servicemember and a Student, and They tried to scam me previously with the first net deal. Only a National Guard or LEO 1ST responder with an account code can use this, NOT ACTIVE DUTY.I ordered a phone for a ""free"" upgrade online where they said I would pay 0.99 a month on my monthly bill for. I added the one time fee.Somehow that turned into a plan change and a $60 month regular upcharge.My monthly plan equates to that of a car payment or gas for one vehicle for a month. This is insane. They are driving customers to their competitors..It gets much worse when you get into fiber or Uverse. I was billed monthly for fiber, but the installer used a broadband network switch that is not capable of fiber.Its a trend of over promising and under delivering with hidden fees. The service has always been great. But their total net profit vs what we spend is unacceptable.Secondly, I spent over $2000 on an Asus Rog 7 phone, then a Planet Astro slide 5G- both certified on their network, but quietly blacklisted.. After their site was showing compatibility. I mentioned it in their ATT forums that they conveniently sunsetted.I do not pay for a service to decide if I buy a phone thru them or not, I pay for a network. They ripped me off whether I used their devices or not.No matter who you go with carrier wise, bring your own device- one with global, freeware. Stop buying overpriced low tier devices.",0
"Having used AT&T as my US cell phone provider for 9 years now, I feel that I finally have to put fingers to keyboard and highlight how utterly abysmal their customer service is.  They have twice in that time just randomly removed my cell phone number (and the first time they did that, they also stole the $100 of credit that was on the account).  When they do delete your number it then becomes extremely difficult to get through to anyone in customer service and, if (BIG IF) you do manage to get through to someone, they are often unable to help resolve the issue.  I am totally p****d with having to change cell phone number and update all my professional stationary, profiles and contacts because of AT&T's complete disregard for their customers.  The question is, who else to try?  These giant communications companies have a virtual monopoly and they couldn't care less about their customers.",0
If there is any negative minus 5 star rating? One of the worst network service.Total waste garbage network.Pathetic customer service.I am with customer care for past 1hr20 min and still unable to resolve the issue.,0
ATT WHEN I FURST SIGNED UP WITH THEM I WAS TOLD WHAT MY MONTHLY BILL WOULD BE. Then it kept changing over time getting higher and higher. I’m on a fixed budget so I’m can’t afford that. Representative would talk to me and tell what they want you to hear. Brings your rate down and by the next month it’s high again. They are a predatory carrier and misleading customers to pay higher prices. Debit your account without permission. Worst service ever. All of 2024 it’s been increases. To my bill.,0
"I have had AT T internet for two years. One day it’s disconnected, not for payment but for “upgrade”. You call and is put on hold for 2 hours. Nobody knows why or this department can’t help , have to transfer you to another. Then after all that , we still had to make an appointment for new equipment, School was on break, family members from out of town was there and no Tv. They didn’t even credit the bill or care that we were out of service for long. It wasn’t even our fault but we had to endure. Please go to CSpire or TMobile. It’s just not worth the high payment here. As soon as our contract ends, we are DONE.!!!!!",0
"I am not exaggerating, if I ever need something changed on my account it takes no less than 2 hours to take care of. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. I have been with the company for a long time and at first I thought maybe it was an isolated issue but it is apparent that AT&T does not value service or customer satisfaction. It takes a miracle to get someone on the phone then usually it is the wrong department and you need to be transferred or the reps don't know what they are doing. I hate complaining about the employees to me it's a management issue.",0
"Impossible to cancel the e-SIM, they make you wait for half an hour on the phone and they tell you I pass you the cancellation departement and you are back to the main menu. I was in the US on holiday and then went back to Europe and couldn't go to a shop to cancel it. From Europe I called the shop and they said I had to call customer service and never could resign from them. People, don't waste your money and time with such bastards!!! On the website impossible to cancel, on the app neither. To pay and for all other services they give info, but to cancel it no way. People, never give them your card number, nothing!!!!!!! They deserve to fail!",0
"I experienced a total loss of my phone and it has been a nightmare dealing with ATT. I forgot my pin on top of everything and they don't believe that I am who I say that I am. I even visited a retail location with my government issued ID, and they would still not provide clearance to my account. After two days of getting the run around, somehow thankfully I remembered the magical PIN number. Onto the next step of filing the insurance claim. Easier said than done. They promised the phone the next day by 4pm only to have it delayed two more days. Total of 4 days without said phone that I paid insurance on. The phone finally arrives today but now I am unable to activate the device because I don't have the old phone to receive the two factor authorization. Now I'm told that I have to go back to the store after the store initially told me they couldn't help me. This experience has to be a sick joke.",0
"I switched to VErizon bc they decided to raise my rates. I did so before my next bill. They charged me $400 and are telling me I cannot get a refund for 31 days!!! Also, never get their Internet Air...it is too slow and there are not options for faster speeds.",0
Wish I could give less than one star. Every month I have hundreds of extra dollars in fees on both home internet and phone bill. Not one single month have I ever paid what they said in the agreement.Att has to be the absolute worst customer service as I am on the phone with them at least once a month for the past year. Hands down the worst service I have ever received since day 1. I wish I could rate 0 stars.,0
"I will never do business with AT&T again. They offer you promotions and then they don’t honor them. You spend hours on the phone with their reps, trying to get them to honor their promotions. Sometimes you succeed, but sometimes you fail and that is not acceptable for them to treat customers like that. I got an iPad based on a promotion that I was promised, and they never honored it. I called them several times over the course of eight months and they never honored their word. So, I finally got frustrated enough after hours on the phone with their customer care people that I cancelled the line because they didn’t honor what they had promised. Of course they promise these things, but don't put them in writing.After all this, then they had the gall to charge me a disconnect fee. I will never do business with this company again. And for the record, this was a transaction through an actual AT&T corporate store.",0
"My phone malfunctioned, so I went in for assistance. They provided me with a temporary phone and informed me that I only needed to pay for an additional line. They also mentioned that I must return it within 14 days; otherwise, I would be charged for the entire phone. I complied, but now they are claiming that I need to pay for it and that I agreed to a 36-month lease. I was never informed about this, and I feel like I was deceived. Bc Im paying for 2 phones now $160 a month",0
"They are horrible , a barrage wait time on the phone is 2 hours , took them 2 days to hook up wifi to my house while previously it would take about 3 hours , they don’t communicate or compensate, do not waste your money here, you’re better off using your data.",0
"I had a representative come to my home, and said he could lower my monthly cell bill. I had T Mobile with a $178 mo. payment. Now my bill is now $214. a month, instead of the $150 that was stated at the  time that I transferred over. I  explained to the representative that I was retiring soon, and I'd like to my bills as low as possible, since I'd be on a fixed income. I feel I was mislead and lied to about the service I received.  I contacted the Customer Service line and wasn't able to get the bill any lower. I also blame myself for listening to someone tell me the amount of the bill, when there was nothing in writing about the monthly statement until after everything was signed. And I got an email in a few days.",0
"Internet went down for no apparent reason so I contacted customer service (useless chatbot) that went between telling me to turn it off and on and telling me there's an outage in the area (there wasnt). Scheduled a tech for following day and of course they failed to show in the FOUR HOUR window and the ""customer rep"" tood me the have no idea why the tech is late or where they are. Beyond pathetic and incompetent customer service.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with the experience I’ve had with your customer agents. They have demonstrated incompetence and misled me into agreements without transparency. Despite my specific service requests, they chose to proceed differently. Due to these issues, I have decided to cancel my lines.",0
This is the worst company to try and do business with. Can't speak to live people. Haven't had internet from the time I paid for it. They want me to pay my bill before they will even talk to me. Not paying bill because they haven't delivered product. I still have no internet. Waiting for it to go to collection and maybe I can speak to someone about selling something that actually works. Can't pay for promises and lies,0
"I finally cancelled AT&T after my bill increased to nearly $70 for basic wifi. I forgot to turn off the automatic bill pay and got charged for internet I didn’t even have anymore. When I called the lady gave me the run around and basically told me they don’t cancel auto pay for you, you have to do that yourself. I straight up told her that’s sneaky and really shady. She didn’t say much. Anyway, I was supposed to get a $65 refund but only ended up getting $47. I also waited 10 weeks for a stupid debit card instead of them just refunding my bank account. Idk how AT&T is still in business. They’re greedy and don’t give a flying **** about their customers.",0
I've been a customer with AT&T for more than seven years. And they won't let me split my payments monthly.,0
I have been a loyal customer for years. I called to have a line added to my account for my grandson. I was told there were system issues. I received the Service Agreement but not the signature page. I called back and agent was rude. Tried to convince me that I was called twice to follow up. I have NO messages from AT&T.,0
I just didnt like the service!!,0
The customer service at AT&T leaves a lot of these desired. I called the customer service number and asked for a call Back. They said it would take between nine and 17 minutes and now I’m at Three hours. This is truly lousy service. I think I will switch my My wireless carrier😡,0
"A customer for over 5 years and now looking for alternatives.Today on December 10th, 2024 contacted AT&T about my cellular bill with a discrepancy about a charge.Recently, I had upgraded my wife’s phone at our local store in Elizabethtown, KY.I was already frustrated when I was finally seen because although I had got an appointment online, the store was not managing appointments and walk-in’s were being taken before me. I was seen 30 minutes later than my appointment.The gentlemen did well to defuse the situation and I ended up leaving with an iPhone 16 plus and iPad.Today I checked my billing to go over all the fees. The iPhone bundle that I opted allowed those who purchased the new IPhone 6 Pro to receive an IPAD for 99 cents a month. The bill I have reflects a price that was three times as much.Originally we were going to get the iPhone 6 Pro; however, the sales associate stated that the one we wanted was not in stock but the brought the iPhone 6 Plus out and informed me that the deal was the same.Flash forward back to today. Customer service looked up my deal. And no they will not honor the deal. The store told misinformed me. And they could only offer apologies.This shows me that they have zero accountability and offer very little remedy discrepancies.",0
"AT&T cut my internet line when they connected my new neighbor’s service. Instead of fixing the line, the service guy left it. I had to take a day off of work for them to come back out and reconnect the service. The service guy said they would bury the line within 10 business days. It has been a month. AT&T caused the problem and still has not finished the work. AT&T should do better! Poor Service!",0
"I signed up with att to have service my mobile hotspot serviced just 8 days ago and decided to cancel it because the wifi service in my house isso weak.  It is a complete nightmare to cancel.  I’ve been ping ponged left and right.  Att should be embaressed for their business practices.  Stay away from ATT, they do not care about service.  I hope they go out of busines!",0
The most terrible 😢 company ever. Call centers only over in India they don’t even speak English. This should be a crime.,0
Worst piece of shit service there is. I literally get no good service no matter where I go unless it’s a big city with 5g. There service locations are terrible. We pay way too much money for such shit service.,0
"After they persuade me to switch and sign up, they would not honor any of the promised discounts. Not just the store, even the FirstNet customer support line. I am not satisfied the way ATT handles my questions ever since I switched. i tried multiple times, in store and on the phone. I regret for sig ing up. I would not advise any one else to come here. I can not wait to leave them. I",0
Att is a thief. They just want money. I just have had att for three months and then transferred my lines to another service. They only attract the customer at the beginning and later on you have to pay much more than what they committed. I hated att in these three months and I am very happy to transfer the service. Never never never trust att agents and the services. They are liars.,0
Their service is always down and I've had then come out at least six times this year for the same issue.,0
"I made a payment agreement with AT&T paying the amount of $349.95 for November 28, 2024 and the other for $348.24 for December 12, 2024. It turns out that AT&T broke the payment agreement by charging me twice on the same day, the 28th, for both amounts. I contacted them for a refund but they don't want to give it to me because of their policies.",0
"I was scammed by someone working inside ATT. Someone called me with full information on my account, including the fact that I had called a week earlier to inquire about lowering my bill. The rep said that ATT wanted to keep their loyal customers. Texts were arriving from the ATT thread. I was offered a significant discount.  Long story short, I gave my credit card info. Shortly after that, I received a notification from my bank that  $240 was charged to my card. I became suspicious and called my bank and ATT. This began a now 2 month process of trying to get refunded. The case was verified as fraudulent by ATT. Their executive office contacted me and assured everything would be taken care of.  Since then, I have called multiple times and spoken to many individuals.  Each individual personally was nice but collectively, horrible customer service. Every person told me something different. As if each person is reading from a different book. Currently, 2 months have passed; still no refund. They care less about loosing a very long time customer, like me. Anyone know how to contact the executive department and not the robots?",0
Have had the worst week with your company had to schedule  three appointments  in one week 1st day technician  José didn't  even step foot in my house  yet he said he fixed my internet i asmueed it was goibg to work which he didn't had to schedule  for the next day the appointment  was scheduled  from 4 to 8 yet same technician came from 315 to 345 I didn't ask for that time. Called your  800 numerous  times was supposed to have a wait  time of 3 to 4 minutes  which  ended up being  a hour and half called back  again for a call back got called back to be  put on hold again for 20 minutes 3rd appointment  which  I was going to be charged a $99 dispatch  I was home second appointment  at time I requested not my fault your stupid tech can't tell time I requested  4 not 3 3rd day tech was very helpful now. I'm  trying to suspend my internet and I can't do that for some reason I have no internet  connection  from my computer  I need to get my computer fixed  so I guess I have to cancel my service with your crappy company  since I can't suspend it,0

"I asked for three lines and was sent five  . I was told I was going to get the phones for free .I was told I would get a $250 gift card per line for switching To pay off my own line , and that my bill would be cheaper than I was paying. I called customer service and found out. It was all a lie the salesman who sold us the phones blocked our number. And we are paying double of what we were told.",0
"Went to Target to what I thought was a consumer cellular place to get a phone as mine was broken. The sales person “Steven” stated that AT&T was owner of Consumer Cellular. I know that Consumer Cellular does contract with them to use their cell towers.Anyways, we are filling out paperwork and as it was taking so long, I kept asking that this was not a new account that I just wanted to buy a new phone. He stated that was right no new contract.He was sending the phone to my house and I kept asking why I could not get one that was for sale right there. He gave me this long winded response.After getting home I read the document that he sent me and he lied, he set me up with a new AT&T account not the same Consumer Cellular one I had. I called and asked him about this and he lied again and said it was Consumer Cellular.I called Consumer Cellular to see where my phone was and they stated they had no order for a phone. I explained what happens and they said that what he stated was not true.I called Steven back and he stated that phone was on the way so he could not cancel the acct as I had to send back the phone when I got it. Now I only have 14 days to cancel this acct. not only that they can charge me a restocking fee as I cannot bring it back to the store that I ordered it from.These people are just scam artist. I have been sitting on the phone for an hr. And no one has picked up so I can cancel this acct.NEVER USE ATT&T!!  SCAM",0
"Almost an unimaginably low level of customer service.  Once you are lucky enough to actually talk to a service representative, they appear to be friendly and willing to address your issue.  But appearances are deceiving, as are the commitments made by the representatives.Do not trust or believe anything the service rep says or promises.  Get it in writing.  Oh, wait, they won't put it in writing, and they won't check the calls that are supposedly ""recorded for quality control"" to see what kind of lies the rep told you as an inducement to get or keep you as a customer.I have been fighting with AT&T since March in an attempt to have them honor the price concession they promised as an incentive for my purchase of an IPhone 15 Pro Max.  To date, there is still no resolution.  Each representative spoken with gives the same standard BS response, namely that the case has been approved, and it will take 2 to 3 billing cycles for the appropriate credits to appear.Thinking of using AT&t as your mobile carrier?Expect the worst, and you will not be disappointed.",0
"I would give them a zero if I could. We had ATT for business phones, they sent a representative to our office named Jarod that said he had a great deal and we should switch to their cell service. We changed and were told and sent a paper that our bill would be $290 - much to our surprise the bill was $1600. We have made several attempts to get them to contact us and also to went to a store to get this fixed.  We were told they could make sure this transition would be easy and smooth and I asked three times that the $290 would be my first bill. Do not listen to this garbage and the billing that they screw you out of your money and then give you some crap that months up the road your bill will be lower!",0
"WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ATT❓ The customer service the last couple of years has gotten progressively worse!I have invested hours trying to speak to a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPERVISOR!No matter how many times you say ‘Customer Service’ you are routed to ANDY…which only half works in any given day! Then you are transferred to a recording that gives you an option for a ‘call back’…one that never comes!SO YOU START OVER JUST TO KEEP BEING LOOPED AROUND AND AROUND! FINALLY GET SOMEONE AND CAN’T UNDERSTAND MOST OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING!This company has sent a clear message that they do not care about us as customers and ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!I left Sprint over 20 plus years ago and my family came to ATT because the customer service was so bad! ONLY RECENTLY HAS ATT BASICALLY BECOME THEM IN HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!It is so frustrating to have to spend this much time trying to get through to someone! My daughter was smart enough to leave 5 years ago to T Mobile and we were too stupid to leave! Because we have been with ATT for more than 20 years, I tried to hang but it’s time! This is outrageous!",0
I am very unhappy my bill was under 280$ for years and recently went up 100$ for no reason and no one has helped me ..,0
"In August of this year, I visited an AT&T store in Grand Junction, CO, to set up four new lines. While assisting me, the representative suggested I also consider switching my home internet to AT&T’s new 5G Wireless service, claiming it would be just as good as my current provider. I was assured that I could try the service risk-free for a week, and if I wasn’t satisfied, I could return the equipment without being charged.Shortly after receiving the equipment in the mail, I installed it and ran a speed test to compare it to my existing internet. The results were disappointing—the speed was not even half of what I was currently getting. I immediately packed up the AT&T equipment and sent it back the next day.Since my bill was on autopay, I assumed that returning the equipment would resolve everything. However, I later discovered that AT&T continued to charge me monthly even though they received the equipment—something a representative confirmed on the phone today (12/16/2024). When I asked for a refund, they told me I needed to have officially canceled the service either by phone or through the website, in addition to returning the equipment.To make matters worse, they claimed they could only issue a refund if I provided the UPS return receipt, despite already confirming they had received the equipment. They insisted this was company policy and that nothing could be done without it.This entire situation has been incredibly frustrating. I expected better customer service and accountability from AT&T. As a result, I’m taking my business elsewhere, and I hope AT&T reconsiders policies like this that only serve to drive customers away.",0
"Bought a iphone thru the ATT app. Didn't like it. Return started the next day. AWFUL. Chat told me to return at ATT store. Went to store. Said I couldn't return it there because the app was ""a different company""??? Back to Chat. Sent me UPS label. Dropped at UPS. UPS tracking said delivered. 5 days later, it was returned to me with no info. Chat again. Sent me another UPS label. Dropped off at UPS. UPS said delivered. Chat said no info on return for 3 weeks! Finally get email saying return received - nothing further to do, any charges will be removed. Next bill - upgrade charges, new installment plan, tax on new phone there. Chat again. Said maybe it would be removed on the next bill!!!! This was insane. The people on Chat don't know anything. ATT doesn't know what it's doing. Can NEVER talk to a person on the phone despite waiting for hours. All together - spent at least 10-15 hours on multiple days on this problem and each time nothing was resolved, just messed up more. It's really ridiculous, frustrating,  and impossible.",0
This is the worse internet service ever. It has been off for 12 hours so far and now I am told it will be at least another 12. Possibly more. Spectrum cost more and now I know why! You get what you pay for. I will be going back to Spectrum.,0
"I am having problems with my phone, no idea if it is me the phone or an update that went wrong.  I tried to go to the Ocala store for help but they only answer questions if you are buying a phone so I called. Hot my call back in 30 minuets as promised.  Spoke with the person for 6 minuets and the call dropped.  After 5 minuets she came back on an said her internet went down.  I asked that my problem be escalated.  After 20 minutes a coworker picked up.  Was then quickly transfered to supervisor John.  Explained my issues and he nicely said we would go through  them.....and ...then...the call dropped.  Total time 63 minuetsTotal problems resolved 0",0
"I bought their products and canceled my existing service because they promised my bills would be much lower. However, I soon discovered it was all a lie. My first bill was over $700, while I had been paying $240 for five phones with T-Mobile. They also promised my internet would be $65 per month, but they charged me $85 instead. I regretted it so much and had to return all the phones and cancel my internet service with them. All of this cost me money because they don’t offer credits or partial refunds, even if you never used their equipment.Please be aware of the salespeople at Walmart; they will do anything to sell you their product, and the bill ends up being completely different from what you agreed to. AT&T really sucks. Their service is terrible, and they don’t even try to help you with credits. They will take your money. So, if you have a good phone plan or internet, please don’t switch—your costs will double or even triple. their samesman ARE SCAMMERS!!",0
"AT&T are 💩 they have to be they now own SKY, VIRGIN MEDIA and 02 the service for Broadband breaks down all the time and they charge double what BT does all I can say avoid them like the plague and If you have service with them then CEASE IT as you can't trust the RIP OFF MERCHANT WHO ARE WORSER THAN KCON!",0
It is the worst experiences I’ve ever had to deal with AT&T for both Internet and cellphone services.,0
"THE WORST COMPANY ON EARTH!  I have been a business customer with 5 lines from AT&T for over 20 years. In the last several years I have been over charged numerous times with very suspect charges. They changed my plan on me without telling me and my bill was much larger. I have spent countless hours on the phone attempting with AT&T trying to resolve these issues. When I say countless I mea 6 hours + in one day. No one has time for that!  They are MASTERS of the transfer, meaning they will claim they can't help you and transfer you to the next person. My most recent bill had sneaky charges for services I NEVER received. They are an extremely deceptive company!  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND them to anyone! Unless you love being completely frustrated and wasting hours of your life and getting no answers- STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM AT&TI happily moved to T-MOBILE and they have been great. It cost me money to move but it has totally been worth it.  Good Luck.",0
"Our experience with AT&T has been extremely disappointing. On two occasions, they have proven to be an untrustworthy company that disregards their customers. Here’s what happened:We traded in our iPhones and shipped them as instructed. The shipment was received by AT&T’s warehouse, but they claimed they only received one iPhone, even though our shipment clearly showed the correct weight. Despite being loyal AT&T customers for five years, they refused to give us the trade-in credit for the new iPhones and made us pay out of pocket.This has happened to us twice when trading in phones. Each time, they essentially stole our money. We called multiple managers, and one initially acknowledged the issue and applied the credit to our account. However, a higher-level manager later removed the credit, blocked our phone, and restricted our account. When we called to address the issue, we were told that a manager had removed the credit and blocked us.This behavior is unacceptable. If someone in their warehouse stole our phone or mishandled our trade-in, it is not the customer’s fault. Instead, they falsely accused us of not shipping the item. This shows a complete lack of professionalism and integrity.AT&T’s poor handling of this situation, combined with their employees’ and managers’ unprofessional behavior, is unacceptable. We will be sharing our story widely, and many of our friends have already decided to leave AT&T because of this. They are a bad company with unethical practices, and we cannot recommend them to anyone.",0
Worst customer service ever I sat on the phone with a woman who could barely speak English and she did not assist me she just cancelled the order and said well we can do it over if u have all the required documents,0
"I wish if I can give less than one starIt is a company that scams people watch your bank account every month .Looking to move to other companyAT&T, it’s a scamming company",0
"Liars.  Do not trust AT&T.  Several lies from the salespersons telling us to sign up for the upgrade, and in the end new phones cost $690more than if we had walked in off the street.  Phones we just purchased are now worth a fraction of the price we paid.  Scammers.  THIEVES.  They will take as much money from you as you let them!!",0
"AT&T The worst Internet provider we have ever had slow Internet, Cuts all the time, Horrible customer service, Lied About gift cards and tricked us into switching the phone line Saying it would be cheaper, but it absolutely wasn’t We are paying ridiculous amounts per month For a terrible service Absolutely do not recommend go any other provider Their sales team uses lies and deception To get you to sign up. We are going to cancel the service immediately and go with any other provider",0
"They had me finance 2 phones without telling me what i was agreeing to.Told the att door to door salesmen I couldn't afford anything new sence I was prego and recently lost my job. He said i could save money. Was told if recieve a 200$ gift card for signing up but I could use it to get 2 new phones along side the internet, without paying extra and it was a promotion. By the time the first bill came i found out they had me finance 2 $750 phones. Was past 14 days and too late to return it. No mention was made that I was financing and I asked multiple times of there was a contract now stuck paying $186 a month for 2 phones for the next 3 years. (Not to mention the separate internet bill)The guy kept talking so friendly an had me distracted as I signed everything on his tablet and never once said I was financing the phones. Let me believe the gift card covered them.cost before att $40 for 2 phone lines and 70 for net now im paying 186+85Att guy heard my old ammount and still made me think i was getting a better deal. He only spoke of one bill not that it was 2 separate bills.Apparently there was an email sent to my fiancé that showed copy's of what I signed but I didn't know till it was too late. They should have been upfront telling me and I never would have agreed.I do NOT need a $700+ phone with my 6 year old playing around with it. I thought it was 2 $100 phones.",0
"My internet went out a couple of days ago.  I work during the day so all I really did was try to fix it myself. I called the number and I got the robot. It went through some testing that didn't work so I had to call back and it did some more testing which disconnected me and it didn't work either.  I called back this morning and the same thing..A ROBOT. Didn't work again. I called customer service and I opted for a call back tat never came.  I called back again and waited on hold for 45 min.  I got an Indian who I could barely understand but she was nice.  She did a couple more tests and said there was an outage in the area.  I looked at outages before I called and there wasn't any.  I work Monday thru Friday 30 miles away and I have to give 24 hr notice to be off. I can't just leave.I had to set it up for Tuesday.  I am without internet for 5 days.  Not only do they need to get more humans on the phone, they need to get people we can understand.  Have your repair people work on weekends for your customers..ATT sure knows how to take your money but the respect for their customers is nonexistent.",0
Att has one of the worst international plans. They absolutely do not value their customers,0
"This has got to be the worst phone company on planet earth. They screw up my account and then can't fix it. I can be in the middle of working on the computer, be in my email checking things, go to a different tab for less than five minutes and it will log me out randomly saying ""it looks like you stepped away so we logged you out for security reasons. WHAT SECURITY REASONS???, I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING WITH IT!!! STEPPED AWAY MY DONKEY TAIL! Then it takes forever to get logged back in because of all the issues with my account that they created. I end up having to call ATT and have to hang on the phone for an hour or more. I have literally spent hours on the phone trying to fix one problem - removing an old email as a recovery email. People do stuff that they don't know what they are doing and then no one can fix it. If it weren't so problematic changing your email on so many different things I would have switched a long time ago. It is now reaching the point where it will be worth it. The people are poorly trained, but are trying to make points to move up and do things they have no idea how it will affect the rest of the account or how to undo it. This company is not at all customer focused. If I could leave zero stars, I would. And when I complain they just say, ""sorry you feel that way"" DISINGENUOUS.",0
"I have been an ATT customer for 25+ years. My cousin passed away on 9/24 and I have been trying to return the iPhone that she purchased under installments in August. For almost 2 months I have spent countless hours either on hold or put in phone loops at ATT. No one knows what to do for me to send the phone back. I was told by a rep to take the phone to an ATT store and they could ship back. ATT store told me that they could not ship back and that they could not print off a shipping label. I was advised to go to a UPS store and give them her account number and they could print off a shipping label. UPS store stated that I needed to come with the label. I have tried to do the right thing with no help. I can’t even properly grieve the loss of my cousin for the hold times, the transfer times, the driving in car to stores. Your process for something like this is broken. All I need is a shipping label. Your reps have no sympathy or empathy for something like this.",0
Internet is intermittent. Cancellation requires a phone call with combative telemarketers who claim they can't hear you .,0
"This Is absolutely amazing. You would think that the higher-ups would read these reviews-umm I don’t think so. If they did, this would not continue which shows me. This is just exercise in frustration. I guess it’s just more Cathartic  Dan anything. I’ll also switch from T-Mobile to AT&T. I upgrade on my old phone 2 my new iPhone. They Quoted me a very nice but my bill does not reflect that. When I contact them on messenger, they were incredibly nice. But unfortunately, I had a very hard time accessing their chats. When I did it went to AI which is pretty much useless in this case and frustrating. So I And calling them. Even though I had my page open and my bill out on my account counter number, they still wanted my password.I told them I use a thumbprint and I have no idea. What is it anymore. They wanted me to change my pass code which I was not going to do and even though I had all the other information, they would not help me with my Bill until I couldn’t verify my password. I finally just gave up n frustration and figure  it out And we’ll figure on my own.￼ They kept saying they are here to help me with sounded really good, but in practice that was not gonna happen. I think I want to look for another company. Like I said, it’s just an exercise in frustration and I’m sure management does read this. And believe me, this is not a bot obviously",0
AT&T needs to invest more on training their human reps. The service is so below sub zero!,0
"Email these folks and pack their inbox: nicolet.macikanycz@att dot com and john.stankey@att dot comThey are the executive leaders who care little about their customers after being shown numerous screenshots of an in-home salesperson who lied and deceived and made promises on discounts which didn't even exist. Maybe if enough disgruntled people let the leaders know they will actually do something.I would never use any AT&T service ever. In my lifetime they are the worst for customer service.This is what I sent them....I signed up for internet in Knoxville, Tennessee for my son approximately three weeks ago.  While getting the internet installed, an AT&T Sr. Associate In-home Expert (Jay S***) came to sell me AT&T mobile services.  I told Jay S***, I was not interested in converting to AT&T, but he was determined.  Mr. S*** asked about my current mobile bill and said if anyone in my family was in the military or healthcare industry.  I told him my daughter was a nurse and he replied it would be a significantly better deal than what I was receiving through Verizon.  He also explained if I purchased an AARP account, I would receive an additional discount stacked on the healthcare discount. He also said AARP provides insurance for phones of up to four claims a year so there is no need for me to purchase additional insurance through AT&T.Mr. S*** promised me a rate of $127.26 plus taxes for six lines with three phones ported over and three lines with trade-ins of iphone 13 to iphone 15 with all discounts applied and three upgraded phones. I have witnesses to attest the following as well as text snapshots from his AT&T work phone to show what was promised to me.  I will attach a few of the text pictures to this e-mail.  Mr. S*** also claimed I could get the combined (wireless and internet) discount as long as my daughter and I used the same address - I explicitly asked if our names being on the accounts being different would pose an issue to which he said no (text shot attached).   NOW, here is the issue, I get a monthly bill for $330 with none of the promised discounts. In addition, he said I would receive $880 in trade-in phone credits but in reality I received $570. Also, on my bill today he applied phone insurance to my account and the option for yearly upgrades.  Which I did not ask for or approve.  It appears Mr. S*** was stacking options to help with his commissions as adding this makes no sense since he said previously the insurance wasn't needed with AARP.  As I stated, he said AARP would cover the four claims a year, but now I found today it doesn't.I was misled on numerous fronts.  I spent over four hours the Saturday after Thanksgiving on different phone calls between wireless reps, wireless managers, wireless retention reps, internet customer service and an internet customer service manager.Being so frustrated with all the blatant misrepresentations, I tried to get my original phones back and cancel AT&T.  Now I am told from AT&T phone representatives it is impossible to receive my phones back.  So, if I cancel with AT&T I have no phones to trade in elsewhere.  Obviously, this ordeal is costing me a significant amount of time and money.  Mr. S*** claims are a clear violation of customer service ethics.  I have been materially financially penalized due to Mr. S*** blatant misrepresentations of the truth.I hope to find a viable solution to the egregious behavior of an AT&T employee which led to me switching from Verizon to AT&T.  Between the loss of my mobile phones and owing $1600 for the outstanding balance to my phones and the all the time trying to rectify this situation,  I respectfully request AT&T to bundle the internet and cellular account with the 20% discount that was originally promised to me.  In addition a $2000 credit to be applied to the account for the increase in plan costs and insurance for phones from what was promised to me.  If this can be accomplished, I would commit to stay with AT&T, not post the detrimental communications sent to me by a representative of the Company and not pursue other means which would certainly be more costly to the company.Please see the attached commitments in the screen shots from Mr. S***.I appreciate your time looking into this matter and look forward to your response.",0
High prices at a high cost. Data breach after data breach. Companies tell us to protect our passwords looks like AT&T should do the same.,0
"I moved into a townhouse in March and was getting an internet service installed through AT&T we were told they were the service provider. During the service a woman name Taylor came in and later tall man came asking us change our phone service to them. They said it would make our bill 150 cheaper every month. Taylor said she would take care of everything. She said for my Verizon phone she give me 1,000 voucher to pay that off. She said we won’t worry about IPads. But what they didn’t tell me to change with them I’d have to pay extra 400 for iPad and she didn’t pay off T-Mobile phones like she said she would. I got call 10 months bill collector saying I owe T-Mobile 1600 out blue no bill was ever sent or anything. They said they would send the bill with the bill with break down to my account but they didn’t instead they put it on my credit. I try to talk Taylor when she’s not in the hospital for her child or her self from my experience when you try call her with any questions. She will just go on and on how she gave us 1000 voucher. The 1000 voucher was just suppose cover the Verizon phone. She said she cover the T-Mobile phones she did not. Her number is +1 (404) 863-6450. Be aware I can’t find her first name or her actual place of work anywhere on signed paperwork. AT&T going around ripping people off. As soon as I can get there phones paid off I’ll never do business with them again",0
"I have tried over 5 times to recover money owed to me by AT&T.   I switched to AT&T over a year ago as I was told that I would have 5G and an excellent signal.  That turned out to be FALSE!   So I called up AT&T and asked for a solution.  They said that could send me a signal booster.  It marginally fixed the issues.    However, what they did NOT tell me was this booster was considered another device on my account and charged me for over 6-8 months.  I also discovered that they had fraudulently opened up additional lines, so had a total of 5 (devices) aka lines when I should have only had ONE!!    So I called up AT&T again and here’s where things get really bad.   The customer service and they way have been treated is beyond egregious.   It took me two to three attempts to get those lines closed and credited back.    Now I have made 5 attempts to get that money returned to my checking account.    I was then told that the money was being credited back but it had to be 2 deposits due to a $500.00 limit on return credits.  I said that was fine.  Total was around $700.00.    Well guess what happened next!!   The Money did not get refunded.   I have now tried 4 more times to get that money returned.   Each time I have to explain the whole situation and each rep has to do all new investigations!!   I have now made several more attempts and have been told that I would receive calls back from supervisors on 4 occasions now and not a single person has called me back!   I am UNABLE to retrieve my money for these additional unauthorized lines and I am beyond angry.   I will be consulting with an attorney and filing a lawsuit against AT&T.    Not to mention I will be closing my account and NEVER doing business with their Mobility division ever again!!!!",0
"I was on someone else’s account, and ended up taking my two lines and transferring them onto my own account.  When this is done, they ONLY allow you to do it over the phone. After the transfer-My insurance was taken off not only my 2 devices but my girlfriend’s 2 devices on the previous line as well. Att told me I couldn’t have insurance because it has to be there from the first 30 days. This took 6- 1 to 2 hour phone calls to get straightened out.Then the next bill was extremely high at $220. I called Att and was told I would get a credit for the one month and that would bring it down to 180. The representative told me, “ your next bill and the following ones after will be 130 plus taxes and fees. This mistake was due to you being on a 1 gb plan instead of unlimited. I promise this issue will never happen again.Fast forward a month.My bill is $812I was still on the 1 gb plan and I have called over 15 times in the past month. I literally got hung up on 5 times and put on hold and they never came back 5 times.5 different times ATT tells me they are ,”creating a case” but can’t tell me the case number because it takes 3 business days to generate. So when I call back they ask for a case number and I can’t give it to them and they can’t look it up. A rep told me a few days ago my bill will be $160. Perfect. But it’s not updated on the account. And my bill is late and still showing I owe $710 . I cannot even begin to fathom how anyone can run a company with such horrible customer service. I’ve never seen anything so disorganized in my entire life.Go somewhere elseEven if it’s twice the cost I assure you that would be a great decision",0

They over charge and rude.  They won’t work with you.  In hopes that they will go out of business.,0
"Rep's deception to obtain account.My husband and I wanted to add Blinq cameras to an empty rental property out of state. We called AT&T and inquired about their service since we already have internet, tv and mobile services at our home. The rep tried several times to upsell throughout the lengthy sales pitch. My husband continued to tell him the ONLY thing we wanted was basic internet until a renter took over the location. The property previously had an Xfinity box outside and I mentioned we should call them and others before deciding. The rep, from another country, disregarded his singular request and aggressively continued upselling tv, etc. In the end, my husband said that he needed the internet asap and could we just go to a local AT&T to pick up the box. The rep said it would need to be shipped and we were insistent that it needed to arrive the next day or we would hold off setting up the account and look elsewhere. There had been squatters and we needed the service asap, even if we had to pay a shipping fee. The rep said it would arrive in a 1 or 2 days and I (wife) said we would decline bc we needed it for security seeing we were returning home and wanted to oversee from a distance. He continued to talk with my husband and said he could get it there in 1 day. I overheard the statement and stated he'd just said it would take 1-2 days and that if he couldn't be certain it would arrive the next day, once again we would pass. The rep placed us on brief hold, then immediately returned to the phone stating that it would be 1 day as he'd gotten ""permission"" from his supervisor. All said and done, it didn't come the next day, nor the next, as we purposely waited hoping it would arrive and then headed home disappointed. It took 4 days and we had to reroute delivery to a UPS location.Upset at the blatant delivery lie, we called back to get further info on service and the rep who misrepresented the service. The new rep, another from outside the US, said that she couldn't see who took the order. She added that was standard for delivery to take 3-4 days and apologized that he said 1-2 days as he knew that wasn't the case. I wanted to include his first name or number here so AT&T could address it specifically as this level of service besmirches their brand.There seems to be no accountability anymore and frankly people just don't care. Well, I do, and standing behind your word is everything. Again, the level of professionalism and customer service is lacking and very disappointing. I will be looking to move my service, from the rental location and my personal home soon.",0

I was on the phone with them/on hold more than 5 1/2 hours on Friday and more than 6 hours on Saturday. I still do not have service. They kept transferring me to departments that were closed, hanging up, cutting me off, lying and saying they'd call back in 20 minutes. No one ever did. Every single person told me something else was wrong. They were rude, unprofessional, untrained and inhumane. THEY DO NOT LISTEN. They lied and they lied and they lied and they lied. And then they had the nerve to try to upsell when their primary service doesn't work. They hire idiots and don't train them other than teaching them not to care about their customers. I run two small businesses and they have continuously damaged my ability to connect with my customers. On top of that, their equipment and their lines are absolute garbage. ATT and the people who work there are pure filth.",0
I wish I could leave zero stars because their customer service is absolutely horrible and all they do is lie to you! I spoke with CS representatives after waiting on hold for hours (2) and then once I got a rep on the phone it was a series of being placed on hold several times while they supposedly were talking to their manager/back office staff or supposed help desk and in then end I wasted over 4 hours of my life and they were unwilling to help absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever had the experience to deal with and the service is subpar compared to my old carrier (Verizon Wireless) which I had for over a decade (30y) and I would have never switched but my bill was out of control and they were offering new subscribers a better price and loyalty means nothing to them but in hindsight I wish I never left if I knew how shitty the service was and how awful the customer service is well buyer beware STAY AWAY FROM ATT!!

"I have been trying like hell to get my number to another service. the phone they want to text to verify me is BROKEN. i have explained this SEVERAL times to them. now i've been paying for months for service i am not getting just so i can keep the phone number. my actual phone i use is with another service now (and i am MUCH happier with their level of concern for their customers). at this point after so long of no access to the number, i just want to cancel. but now they only offer tech support on a limited schedule. you better hope you are having trouble when it's convenient for them to help you! and any call takes over an hour by the time you hold for them and explain it over and over again to different people. all i want to do at this point is cancel service. they want me to make an appt for a phone call for WEDNESDAY. it's SUNDAY. seriously???? THIS is why big name monopolies get the reputation they have. it's unbelievable how low their standards are these days. i am forced by my apartment complex to have my internet with them, but I will never recommend at&t to ANYONE after all of this. in fact, i will tell this story to anyone that is looking for cell service. It's all fine and good until you need them or they screw your account up. but if you need them at all, they are ABSENT and feel no obligation whatsoever to be there for their customers. i've been trying to get this done for over a year.",0

"I would love to give negative stars. If we didn't live in a dead zone I would never speak to anyone who works at this stupid company again. My husband and I have spent over 6 hours in the stores and an additional 7 hours on the phone with AT&T and Consumer Cellular trying to get new phones and switch from Consumer to AT&T. AT&T somehow created 2 accounts with our numbers and created a crap storm that has left us in an endless loop. They have no solutions except MAYBE if we switch to a completely different service and then switch back they could do it. We need to have our new phones to supposedly fix this issue but we can't get them because the accounts are separate and they won't send the phones. Every single person we talk to can't do anything. The absolute worst customer service ever. Did I mention they charged our credit card over $1100..and ran our credit 3 times without permission. The reason I have time to write this rant...I'm sitting, YET AGAIN, in a AT&T store while my husband is on the phone with Consumer Cellular and there's no fix. I LOATH AT&T...and the Hills in San Francisco that prevent us from being able to go with literally any other services. I would even take Verizon over this mess.",0
An AT&T employee used my account to open an  account under my name I  was paying his bill for 14 months I found out from a friend who works there they would not tell me why an sent his bill to collection under my name an would correct this fraud an it’s still against my credit,0
"I have been paying 4.5 years for insurance that is supposed to cover batter replacement. When making a claim they send you to a 3rd party who wants me to drive 2hours away or pay $250 for a new phone that I can buy locally for the same price. The insurance is a scam, ATT is all about quantity not customer service",0
I have to join in with the others.  ATT lies to get you under a contract and doesn't abide by what they conned you in to.  I'm wondering if Channel 4 News or any local news company would like a good story.,0
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I spent literally 3 hours to request a CSR document for my business and they either give me runarounds, sending me to different departments or say they would call back. They never call back. If you call back they all of the sudden have an 11-12 hour wait. What a joke. I don’t understand why it is so hard to just give me ONE DOCUMENT. Unprofessional and unreliable.",0
"Signing up for AT&T’s dedicated internet service has been one of the worst decisions our business has ever made. Despite having a signed contract outlining the agreed-upon costs, AT&T has charged us far more. To make matters worse, they’ve failed to apply the California Teleconnect Fund (CTF) credits that were clearly included in the agreement.When we’ve tried to fix these issues, their customer service has been an absolute disaster. They give nothing but false promises and empty reassurances. Every time we contact them, we’re passed off to another representative, creating an endless cycle of frustration with no resolution in sight.AT&T’s lack of accountability and their failure to honor their contracts has been a major regret. Avoid AT&T Business at all costs—it’s simply not worth the headache or the expense.",0
"Bought a new phone and had to send my old phone in for credit.  I explained to the ""service""(joke) rep that i was in remote Alaska and it would take at least one month for my old phone to get back to them and not to charge me if it was past the due date.  They said no problem, and then added a 300 dollar charge to my account because my phone got there three days late.  No one can help me, not one rep offered any solution.  I really hate dealing with this company.",0
"Terrible Experience - Beware of Billing and Customer Service Issues.I am extremely disappointed with AT&T. We signed a contract expecting to pay $150 per month, but we’ve consistently been charged $200 or more. This isn’t just a small error—it’s blatant overcharging. On top of that, customer support has been unhelpful at every step. They promised discounts and callbacks from a manager that never happened. To make things worse, they closed the store at First Colony Mall, and now even in-store support at other locations can’t resolve our issues.AT&T’s service has been nothing but a hassle, with misleading information and broken promises. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable service or honest billing practices.",0
Worst company ever never had so many problems. They continue to have excuses about why my bill keeps rising and rising and every time I call to get answers the representatives have all kind of excuses about why your bill is so high. They lie and don't want you to speak to their supervisors. One month they are removing things from my bill the next month it's a bigger issue. I'm beside myself. If they cant fix the problem i'm going to another company.,0
Very bad customer service. Sales is mis leading,0
By far the worst carrier I've ever had I would leave them zero stars if that was an option,0
My problem has been going on since 8/22/24...today is 11/14/24.  I have wasted countless hours!  I was contacted BY AT&T and was told that I was eligible for a free phone for our business account because I was a good paying customer and they wanted to keep our business. Time #1 they sent me the wrong phone...I sent it back.  After a month again they told me I was going to get my phone...I got an ipad (which I had to send back & just now got the charges taken off of my account for).  Now I am being told they don't have a promotion for a free phone anymore.  Guess what!  I guess not because you kept screwing up my order and it made it too late for me to get my free phone.  Good luck getting someone to listen to you though.  Each agent told me they were noting my account and each agent had no clue what I was talking about.  So if AT&T calls you to give you something do yourself a favor and hang up!  Save yourself lots of time.  I am still out sales tax that was charged to my credit card from where I was supposed to get my phone.  I will still have to call to get that resolved.,0
"This is the company where you will never get the honesty , they have the worst   costumer service ever . I did huge mistake jumping out from T MOBILE to this weak connection service .so I got scammed from those representatives who they promote in Target .he said I will get 250$ per line and you can upgrade my old phone to newer which paying full amount right now ,beside that they make you easily frustrated when you just try to contact their bad costumer service. They only know one thing and that is their script. overall very disappointed  highly unrecommended:(",0
worst customer service ever can’t believe at&t got so bad on customer service .. didn’t know if i was taking with a robot or a human being how you can put someone answer like this to customer this guys he doesn’t belong to customer service really  id ks43y please help yourself found another job customer service it’s not for you,0
"Rep over the phone outright lied about sending apple watches that would be paid for with ""credits"" that did not exist. Rep stated multiple times that the cost of the watches would be immediately offset by credits and to please sign the financing for the watches in order to process the order. Rep then asked for me to pay the taxes on the watches as that was the only thing that these ""credits"" would not offset.Found out today while fixing the account issues that she created when improperly bringing on the new line (which was the only reason I had called), that there were no credits and I had been straight up scammed into financing 3x apple watches on my plan. Customer services solution was to offer multiple opportunities for me to simply PAY for the watches anyways at a slightly discounted rate. Kept implying and using language that I HAD LIKELY MISUNDERSTOOD!!! Would not listen to the recorded call and acknowledge that their rep lied. Offered to have feedback sent into their inhouse team to have the issue addressed. This is code for ""please leave your negative feedback internally so that we can hide it from the public.""**Do not trust anything a representative says to you over the phone. They lie. They then wasted HOURS of my time pushing a product that I did not even request. Later they then implied that the fault was possibly mine and that I may have misunderstood. They then gave me the wonderful offer to simply pay them for the items anyways like that was a favor. I now have to go out of my way in the middle of yet another work day to send back the items. They acted like refunding me the sales tax I was made to pay was some sort of special favor. And in the end with her deepest condolences and apologies offered to give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience. Absolutely ridiculous...",0
"The customer service is absolutely awful. It takes hours on the phone to get anywhere with an issue. When we go to our local retail store they won't unlock the door even though the sign says open and we can see a employee inside. We have two other friends that have experienced the same thing. They knocked on the door of store and they just ignored them. Lights on, open sign on, and hours on door are within open hours. Door locked won't help any of us. Its ridiculous",0
"I am extremely grateful for their prompt and efficient services, which gave me peace of mind during a difficult time. I highly recommend LEINS FELDERS for any financial or legal needs. They truly go above and beyond to ensure their clients' satisfaction.",0
Just lost a 22 year customer Verizon just saved me 2600.00 over att. Loyalty means nothing to them. Terrible service lost calls and warranty is a joke.,0
Worst experience ever !! If I could give 0 stars I would. Ridiculous hidden fees and incompetent customer service staff. If you value your time and money do not ever utilize this company !!,0
"If I could rate AT&T 0 stars I would, horrible horrible service. My PAID phone service got cut off THREE separate times for no apparent reason within the last two weeks. I spent about 2 hours in the store 2 separate times and an hour on the phone. I spoke to their “loyal” program and they want to credit my account $11. They have no problem collecting your bill money but can’t make sure your service is working. What????",0
"Spent a week without internet. Service finally fixed correctly and order placed to bury new line. When completed, I again, no longer had service.  Checked the box at the back of my house and found line that was neatly placed under the housing to be out and poorly zip tied into the box. Obvious that they disconnected and poorly attempted to fix. When reported, was told I had to be home for repair- after already taking 2 days off of work. I can't believe a company who deals in customer service is only available 8-4 Monday to Friday.  Ready to drop AT&T internet, Direct TV, and 3 cell phones over poor customer service.",0
Apparently if you buy an Apple Watch with installment plan then you also have to pay for the watch to have a phone number for your calls/texts to come through and if you try to cancel the watch phone plan (not the installment payments) then they bill you for all of your remaining installment payments at once as well.,0
"I had fiber for over a year, sales rep talked me into bundling phone for a discount and agreeing has been a huge regret. Received new phone and tried to activate on my own. When not capable called customer service and had them activate. After phones have been activated I saw a huge difference on a price than what sales rep. Talked earlier. I called customer service again and asked, Was told they couldn’t help me since a home rep sold me phones. sales rep would not talk to me, never answers the phone barely replies the text with no reliable answer even with begging and pleading for help, I visited a store, they told me the same as they could not help because they don’t know how the sales rep was able to manage to give me that price. I will call corporate office and see what solution I will be given but definitely will go out of this service even the fiber I had over a year. They may say can’t help because you trusted somebody we selected to fraud innocent people going around knocking the doors so we can make some money which we couldn’t by regular business. Nothing for the pain sweat and LITERAL TEARS of this terrible move.",0
"POS are the three best word I can describe AT fn T. I am beyond angry. I am paying $12/day for international passport but have not been able call send or receive. I can only text. This POS company could not fixed my problem after being on the line with for over 2 hours. POS, POS……..",0
I purchased a prepaid international add on plan for a week while in Italy. While the internet worked and the messaging sometimes worked I could not call out and calls from Italy could not come in. I couldn't even call AT&T from my phone. A few US calls were received. Spent two separate hours on the phone with AT&T to try to fix this from my husband's phone whose AT&T plan was working. . On second one the agent could call my phone after trying to fix it (not sure where from) but when I went to call out a few hours later once again it did not work. Called AT&T for a refund--was sent back and forth among departments and a refund was denied (after 5 contacts/attempts to contact) because there was evidence of some service usage. I could not call out for 95% of my time. THis is very poor customer service and AT&T took no responsibility for the phone function not working almost all the time. Do not get this plan.,0
"Att is the worst phone company ever they lie so much and get you to get Services through them so they can get Commission. They tell lies to get a service and when you look at your bill, it’s skyrocket it through the roof and then they don’t even wanna fix it and make excuses for the other teammates. Also Hurricane Helena knocked out a lot of their towers and the service has been no good ever since and they don’t even have any compassion about the situation and still want to charge you the same amount when they know that their services aren’t all the way back up. I would not recommend AT&T to anyone. Also I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau to follow complaint and let them know about the scamming that AT&T is doing save your money and go with a company that’s more observant of it.",0
"A long time ago, we switched our provider from Comcast to AT&T. A technician from AT&T installed a lot of wiring into our walls throughout our house and tethered a heavy device.We did not like the service, so we switched back to Comcast.A Comcast technician removed and disposed of as much AT&T debris as he could-not all of it-and restored our Comcast service.Over the years, my mom’s health declined, and she died in summer ‘24.Upon going through my late mom’s things and declutterring our house, I rediscovered the residual AT&T wiring that I cannot remove.I called AT&T and told them my story, asking for help to remove their debris. The first rep I spoke with said, “I’m sorry for your loss. We will get a technician to clean up the mess that was left by AT&T.”After holding for an hour, a 3rd rep told me that AT&T will not help me, and I need to appoint someone on my own to clear away their debris.I need AT&T to clear away the mess they created in my house years ago, so that I can move forward with my home improvement. I didn’t ask for money. I just want them to get their junk out of my way.",0
"I keep getting screw by AT&T service, being over charged, paying unrealistic fees, just bad all around, as a veteran I am suppose to get a 25% discount, but all my bill does is go up with being charged data that I am not use, I have been on hold with customer service after being transferred from collection departmentUsing Donld Trumps words! AT&T your firedCustomer service people they are stupid",0
"This company is like an ex with bad communication that will not let go.  I left them and had my number ported.  Although I followed the process and entered the code to unlock my phone that AT&T gave me, my phone remains locked.  I have not had phone service for 3 days.  I have children and a sickly mom, and no phone service.  When I contacted customer service, she kept insisting that she would text a code or call me.  I kept repeating to her that the reason I was chatting is because I cannot receive or make calls or texts.  She then proceeded to offer me deals. ""I don't want to do business with you anymore!"" I will be removing my other phones and moving them over to another provider too.  I spent about 2 hours trying to straighten things out and I still don't have phone service.  This company is horrible and their customer service reps are incompetent.",0
"AT&T prepaid is the absolute worst. Do not do it avoid it. After hours of trying to get it set up it only took 10 minutes with US Mobile but hours with AT&T the service would not work until I paid. They refused to accept my credit card, even though the bank was accepting, rather they would reverse it and then claim bank declined! 10x 2 different cards!The third-party company that is committing all of these acts for AT&T, then had the gall to try to charge me a five dollar fee to verify that I was who I am after my email had already been verified and after the bank had already approved the payment multiple times.It would appear that this is a delivery scheme to generate five dollars from each customer by making all of the credit cards fail until you call them and spend hours to get them on the line so that you can tell them which address you lived at when you were 20 years old.If I have the energy, I will file an attorney general complaint and I encourage everyone else to do the same to put this to an end. I definitely will move away from AT&T forever over this unless they personally apologize to me and solve this problem for everyone.",0
after many years of having att i feel that they are not loyal to long time customers. after i cancelled their service i was than offered a much lower option with fiber. also sending their equipment back so not to be charged 150 dollar fee is really hard. i had to call them several times before i got them to send me a fedex package to send it back. i am glad i found a local company that offered me fiber at a lower price,0
"Sales representative Jason Nicol phone number 323 499 3155 that approached me at a sales retail store (target) lied to me about getting a better price and a better internet service compared to my current internet service provider, he even highlighted to me the promotion I was getting, plus my first month will be free and and after installation I’ll get a $55 gift card but it turned out it was all a lied. After one week of having my internet installed my balance was $70. I called costumer service and in fact he works for AT&T but AT&T told me they did not have the promotion I was told about and that they were sorry for the misunderstanding. So I went ahead and canceled the service right away…..",0
"I called AT&T because I paid my internet bill, I received an email saying my payment FAILED! I checked my account balance and the funds were taken out. I called AT&T had to wait for someone to call me back. When they called me back the person could not help me (Sam). I asked to speak with a supervisor I waited for 45 minutes. Which is unacceptable and unprofessional to me. I had a HARD time understanding San and the supervisor they both was talking so fast. I had to ask both of them slow down so I can understand what they were saying. Plus they try to over talk me too.The problem I was trying to get resolved was so SIMPLE. They said I was on auto pay I said I am not because I pay my bill on phone each month. So I said AT&T owes me money so AT&T is double dipping. If AT&T is taking it out of my account and I am paying it too, Neither one of them could not understand what I was talking about. I will be calling the corporate office on Monday and I am going to change inter provider. Not a happy customer with AT&T!!",0

"WARNING !!!! STAY AWAY!!!! Literally two of the worst managers I've encountered in less than 8 days. I would not come to this location as they have a new manager named Garrett. Garrett without my consent took in my trade that I told him. I wanted to get a refund on because a previous sales person by the name of Zachery sold me new iphone and plan telling me I could combine the new number to my main phone line. This would allow me to have a new phone and not have to pay off the other phone. All I would have to do is pay the taxes on the new phone.I technically have 14 days to return my new phone and 30 days to trade in my new phone. However when I went in today trade in my phone I was told I still had to pay the balance on my old phone. I explained the situation to Garrett and all Garrett did was look down at his eyepad not once looked me in the eyes while explaining that Zachery made a misstep. I then told Garrett I would like a refund and keep my old phone and return the new one and remove the additional phone line since I was tricked into buying the new phone.Well Garrett did not tell me while he was on his iPad that instead of processing the refund and return he actually processed the trade in without my formal or signed concern. Garrett basically said he could no longer process a refund because he processed the trade in. Garrett then tossed the receipt on the table and walked away. Not only was that rude it was a fraudulent transaction since I did not consent to trading in my phone. I am surprised AT&T would allow Garrett to be a manager and conduct shady business while having a new hire and existing staff near by. Garrett lacks integrity, leadership, decision making skills. Processing my trade in without my consent and not refusing to refund me my money and give back my old phone is absolutely unacceptable since I am well in my rights to do so.This AT&T location is an Authorized Retailer not an actual AT&T store. That means that these kind of issues are dealt with at the Authorized Retailer level and corporate AT&T does not get involved. So basically you get ripped off.What basically happens is they steal your trade in of $1000 dollars and give you the street value of $350. So now if I return my new phone and cancel my new phone line they will only give me $350 for my old phone versus the $1000 dollars promotional offer I was promised. Why would I want to sell them my phone for $350? When I would have just kept my old phone and been a happy customer. Garretts lack of customer service, communication and honesty was by far the worst I've experienced at any store I've been to. I personally would never hire someone with that type of integrity.It's no wonder Zachery was let go and they have such a high turnover rate. That is two managers I've dealt with in less than a month. Now Garrett is the new manager and that's even worse than Zachery. This location will steal from you like they did from me and I would highly recommend you go to an Actual AT&T store or buy online from AT&T. These Authorized Retailers are shady and especially this location. Why would you continue to hire managers who steal and mislead their customers.The name of the company that's responsible of the location is Prime Comms - AZ. Prime Comms - AZ should really do a better job of hire their employees and especially their managers.I can't believe I've encountered two of the worst dishonest managers Zachery and now new manager Garettt who will basically with no remorse steal from you.",0
The most horrible costumer service. When will you stop exporting jobs to other countries. Your customer service employees barely know English and are difficult to understand.    So sad,0

"I just spent an hour and 40 minutes at two separate AT&T locations trying to upgrade 2 phones. 60 minutes at the first location, there was a glitch in the safe where they keep phones, so that took more time. Then there was a glitch with the software he had to restart the process of upgrading, twice. During the process, he tried to sell me on screensavers and high-speed charging blocks. I told him I did not want any extras, he tossed his phone on the ground and said do you have faith that the protectors you buy on Amazon will protect your phone like this. Such a gimmick. After an hour, I finally left because there were error messages in the account and he needed the supervisor. I then went to another att, waited for 30 mins while they contacted customer service. No resolution, no new phones. I then called att to pass along my displeasure and they told me to write a letter to corporate headquarters. Such terrible service with no solution.",0
"Horrible company. If you accidentally call internationally (other than US, Canada, Mexico), it is $3/min! No one will tell you this, until you have accumulated hundreds of dollars of charges. So, you need to add ""international call blocking"" to your cell account. But that will not stop you from being charged ""international data roaming""! You have to block that too! It is so confusing, when you call, even their own reps don't know about all these. How are you, ATT, expect an average customer to know? I guess that's how they charge hundred of dollars from their customers. Completely unethical practice!!!If you think you are well protected from adding the above two block, you are wrong! You have to call them to add ""international text blocking"", otherwise you will still be charged! My gosh, how crazy it that? The greed and dishonesty of this company is beyond description!Finally, if you log into your ATT account, you can add ""add on"" to your account. But the above are not shown, so you cannot add them on yourself. Worse yet, you don't even know they exist. You are welcome now that you know.",0

I am very disappointed with at&t. I'm not taken seriously because I shouldn't wait for more than a month for mck code. It isn't right. Especially when I'm in another country especially while im contacting the customer service every day. I regret chosing at&t as a provider,0
"I have been on the phone with AT&T For 3 hours. No one knows what they are doing...It is appalling that I can't get service to my New home. 3 customer service Reps and a supervisor and still no satisfaction. All I want is internet. Check this out,   I (not them) had to Contact the present owners who I've never met to get them to submit a date of cancelation before I can get service. Even though the have all the information in their system WOW! When I got back to them My entire order was canceled. They kept asking for a electric bill or water bill to prove I live there but I haven't  moved in yet. In one week I will move in and just wanted internet on when I arrive. My Electric, water and garbage will all be turned on on that date with no problem and in 15 minutes of contacting them But,  for some reason AT&T has made it so difficult I had to hang up. I am a very patient man but this is the worst operation I have ever seen.  If it's this difficult to get service on I can't imagine what it would be like to cancel.I expect AT&T corporate to contact me but I have little faith this will happen",0
"The record-keeping is so screwed up, and when you call, they can not find your account or your phone or your pin. The problem is primarily when you want to cancel, not when you buy their phone or internet. Simply you can not cancel even if the equipment does not work within the 30-day grace period. If you do, they mess up your credit.  This is terrible. I hope nobody has to go through this.",0
I have six accounts with at&t.The county changed the addresses on our road about 7 years ago every time I call to give them the proper address they tell me they have no service at the new address. Keep in mind i already have service at the physical location already. They tell me if I change the address I CANT get service so I cant give them the proper address that would be a problem with a 911 call going to an address that no longer exists.please someone with common sense help with this matter.,0
Is att going to the garbage? Why didn't anyone tell me..I should've caught on because the extremely high rates for the extremely lack of common customer service. Terrible service,0
I have had three Galaxy s22 on my account for well over 2 years. I elected to get the extended warranty when I bought them. Never had a claim. Recently the battery on one of them started failing. I called AT&t and they sent me to their agent asurion. That was 10 days ago. Nightmare ever since. First they wanted to send me over 60 miles away to a tech center. I live in metropolitan Orlando. I refused and asked AT&t to intercede. They did and asurion agreed to send a tech to my home to replace the battery. Never showed up. I called again. Asurion said the appointment was canceled because they didn't have the part. Said they would probably be getting new batteries and I should sign in and check every day to see if a battery is in. I said why don't you call me when you get it. They said it doesn't work that way. There is much more craziness to this story but I won't bore you with the details. AT&t needs to do a better job of picking their agents,0
"Extremely Disappointed with AT&T’s Customer Service and Unfulfilled PromisesI’ve been a loyal AT&T customer for over three years, and this is the first time I’ve had to contact customer service. Sadly, this experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing, and I feel compelled to share it here.Despite being a long-term customer, I received poor service from AT&T’s support team. My issue was not addressed properly, and the promises made by the agents to resolve my concerns were not kept. I was left feeling completely disregarded and unimportant to the company.I expected much more from a company I’ve trusted for so long. Instead of the courteous, helpful service I should have received, I felt like I was treated as if I didn’t matter at all. I’m deeply disappointed by how my situation was handled and by the complete lack of professionalism and empathy shown by the customer service agents.It’s hard to believe that a company that I’ve been loyal to for years would treat me this way, and now I’m reconsidering my relationship with AT&T moving forward. I sincerely hope that AT&T will take this feedback seriously and make improvements to its customer service. Long-time customers like myself deserve better treatment than what I experienced.#DisappointedCustomer #AT&T #CustomerServiceFail #UnresolvedIssues",0

AT&T is a joke. All they are interested in is making a sale. They were supposed to pot a number. Three different agents canceled the other agent deal to redo it for themselves. Got all my personal info social security number drivers license number although I ordered no equipment. I had my own phone. I wanted a landline and was told they didn’t have landlines and cellular service would better. I had been transferred different departments any given different numbers to call. Most of the representatives didn’t understand English and repeat the same thing. I requested a supervisor and I was told they were sitting next to them assisting with the call twice. The last time I called I insisted on speaking with a supervisor and was on hold just to speak with another agent. They are bad business. I love Verizon best customer service and if they could port the number I NEVER would have called AT&T for ANYTHING!! FYI the number requested was a Bell South landline. Company was bought out by AT&T. I called to cancel and the agent was rude just hung up after I asked if all my information is removed out of their system.,0

"Our family had AT&T Wireless services, originally with five (5) lines, for almost thirty (30) years.  In September, AT&T applied an additional $20 per month charge for 5G services; which we did not have.  So, I advised AT&T we would be canceling our service with them.  Accordingly, last month, all AT&T Wireless services were cancelled.  Today, an AT&T bill arrived for the next month's service.  After 42 minutes on a phone call to AT&T Customer Care, and previously being told we would only be billed for a day or two of service, AT&T refused to reverse the next month's charges.  AT&T Customer Care said the cancellation was one day into a new billing cycle, and they have a ""No prorated service policy.""  $153.68 for one day of service.  WHAT A TOTAL RIP OFF!",0
"I started my AT&T service in 2018. At the time it seem like AT&T was doing OK. They bought DIRECTV not too long ago and it seemed like my service was pretty good.My first impression I feel like AT&T has gone downhill pretty significantly not only did my stock go down substantially, but the company is really letting me down, especially within the last year. They made it out like 5G was going to be the next best thing and service would be amazing. I have to say the service is amazing and even when I have 3 to 4 bars of service on multiple occasions, my phone has me down and told me I have connection. I would understand if this were happening at a sporting event or something like that however, I have been around for 30 minutes trying to post this because of the service being so bad and I’m in Concord, North Carolina not even like the big city  right now I have 3 bars of 5G+ and I have literally no connection I had to connect to McDonald’s WiFi to post this.

"I have great respect for dedicated retail consultants, especially those I know working for AT&T/prime communications. However, after being lied to by customer service regarding her employment with the company and receiving no response following an apathetic apology from the Office of the President, despite submitting evidence of what I endured at the hands of one of their employees, I will never return as a customer.This employee’s harassment was severe. Her actions led to a severe sprain in my foot and ankle, resulting in lost wages since I couldn’t work for the rest of the season. She intentionally triggered flashbacks by slamming doors and confronting me at my door, putting me in fear for my life and my children’s safety. She even went so far as to make a false report with Child Protective Services.I eventually had to move because of her, yet she lied to the courts, stating that I was the reason for the delay in my relocation. When the actual reason was due to scheduling conflicts with inspections by the borough. She even conducted a background check on me—not for any service-related purpose, but to reach out to my ex and support him in court. She manipulated the judges, fully aware of my severe anxiety and status as a disabled veteran with a high mental health rating. She labeled me as “bipolar” to further discredit me, though I live with Borderline Personality Disorder, a deeply painful mental illness. I don’t just “switch off”; I hold onto these impacts for weeks, months, even years.If AT&T wants to recover their money, they’re pursuing the wrong person. I’ve endured more than enough, and this experience has made it clear I deserve far better.If there is any confusion, she was my neighbor. While this platform makes you out in a date, this had been going on since November of 2023.",0
This is the worst cellphone company I have ever had. They are so expensive and lie constantly.,0
Do not sign up for ATT. At least not in the Jersey Shore area. Goes off line so much I had to buy a cheap phone from Verizon to use when ATT is off line. I've asked hundreds of people in the problem areas and all have same issue. Even people with the most expensive phones. Must be tower problems. And they won't let you out of the contract. Super frustrating!! Reviews asks for date of bad experience but it's every single day. Even if I dont go out.,0
"Starting in April 2024, AT&T has repeatedly removed my account from Auto-pay, and I lose my auto pay discount. also end up paying late because I didn't know they'd removed my auto-pay. I've had to call in each month to have this ""fixed"". It is now November 2024 and this ""glitch"" has been ongoing. Every time I sign back up to autopay for the discount I get an email right before its due to kick in that I've made changes to my account, stating that I've removed my account from autopay. Except I made no changes to my account. Strongly recommend going with another company",0
"Had a plan for $60 a month with no price increase if I went paperless. I pay my bill on-line. Went on-line to pay this month and my bill jumped to $65 with no explanation. When I finally got a hold of a representative, she said I could get my original price if I gave my bank account information or a credit card number. I told her they were breaking their agreement. She said once I start paying the $65, my rate won’t go up…until they want to do this again! Oh, and they did this during a hurricane! I haven’t had service since 9/26/24!Take a snap shot of their offers for verification or get a contract! I’m not sure if either of those will help, but just know they're not sticking to their offers!",0
"Just want to alert everyone that the AT&T/Costco promotion is totally misrepresented. Clearly the AT&T reps (all young) at Costco, desperate to sign on new subscribers, are either 1) not fully informed of and do not understand a package they are selling or 2) could just be very selective in sharing information upfront that would have been a nonstarter for consumers like me. 18 months after signing what I though was a great deal, I I am now stuck in a contract for 3 years which I have to no choice to take to term before I own the  Iphones which, BTW, were marketed as being free upgrades. I actually gave a up an existing AT&T family contract where my phones, now paid off, were returned to AT&T as part of this deal. Numerous calls to various levels of AT&T reps resulted in more frustration and left me with a terrible impression. Prior to signing the ""back hole"" agreement, I had already been with AT&T for 20 years.",0
"AT&T air internet is the worst Internet I have ever had. It is intermittent all day everyday. I stream everything, so imagine trying to watch a movie when your internet keeps turning off and on all day long. They have sent their people out here many times to repair to no avail. I am truly done with you guys. I just cancelled my direct tv which is owned by AT&T and I will be cancelling my internet and mobile phone plans as well.  Bye forever AT&T!",0
If I could give them a 0 I would! We have internet with them and now 2 months in a row they cut off my services AFTER I paid my bill! Now they are trying to tell me that they will not cut.my service back on unlessi pay the bill that's not even due yet! We called after they cut.our services off and they assured us that it was their mistake and the services would be cut back on. We'll they were never turned back on. So we called back and now we are being told they they are having a SYSTEM GLITCH and want us to pay a bill that's not even Dye yet to turn my service back on! This is.the 2nd time they have done this! We will be finding a new service and I will NEVER use ANYRHING AT&T again!,0

"I'm complaining about the AT&T office in Columbia MS by the Dollar Tree!! My husband and I went to have his phone unlocked so he could use another SIM card in the phone. My husband has already talked to AT&T on the phone and they told him to go the office and they could help my husband.When we walked into this office the man at the first desk looked at us all confused and didn't know what he was doing. Then when the employee asked the other employee if the wanted to do paperwork the reply ""No I'm eating Cake"" and both employees were watching tv on the big TV. There were super rude!! Terrible Customer service!!",0
"I spoke with William about getting a new phone and I wasn't eligible for an upgrade and then he said, if I opened up a third line, I would be paying the same price as I am for 2 lines so I did, and he told me that if I buy a phone off eBay an S7 Edge, I could get a Samsung. S24 ultra for free and he even helped me find it on eBay. I've been trying to get ahold of the back office, but they still won't get back with me all of the customer services doing is give me a run around. I did talk to the loyal department and all they are doing. Is giving me a run around too? They even took $436 out of my account for no reason. And they wouldn't even refund it. If anyone is trying to get a phone from AT&T for business, I would not recommend it customer service sucks.",0
THE ABSOLUTE WORST! Increased my bill without me agreeing to any upgrades! Spoke to a customer service person that was clueless! Kept going around in circles! Wasted over an hour of on the phone!! HORRIBLE!!,0
"My voicemail box is locked and I've been on hold waiting for an agent for 30 minutes now. I run a business and cannot wait this long to speak with an agent! There is no reason that a company like AT&T cannot provide technical assistance in a reasonable time, but they choose to make their customers angry. Must be nice to be almost a monopoly!",0
"Let's start by saying if you live in Altoona,PA, and go to the At&t store on Pleasant Valley Blvd beware. In April I went in to upgrade my watch, Nathan talked me into getting another watch and upgrading my phone cause it wouldn't be much more money because the watches were buy one get one free and I would get a thousand dollars for my phone if I would trade it in. Needless to say I got 2 new watches and a new phone but remember I should be getting all these discounts and rebates. 6 mos later I get a text saying I canceled one of my lines for one of the watches. I call customer service only to be told that it was my problem to fix what the at&t store messed up. Nathan canceled my original number that my watch was tied to and gave me new numbers on both watch lines. I didn't know this happened but since he canceled my original line for my watch I have not gotten the watch for bogo or 27 something a month accredited to my account for the phone trade in. Originally I was told it would take a while for me to see the discounts so I didn't think anything of it. The first customer service person I talked to which by the way was a manager stated that I had to reinstate my original line to get the discounts and if I didn't reinstate the line I would not receive any money back, that guy ended up hanging up on me cause I said that he needed to explain to me why this became my problem to fix when someone there messed up and why i needed to reactivate a line that wont have a watch tied to it, i simply said that i didn't need another watch. So an hr later my husband called and spoke with someone that knew what he was doing and fixed everything, my husband was on the phone for an hr and a half but fingers crossed everything is taken care of.",0
"AT&T has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Every issue requires not just one, but four to five calls—sometimes even more—just to have a chance at getting it resolved. Each time I call, I’m met with a new answer or conflicting information, making it impossible to feel confident that anyone truly knows how to help. It’s incredibly frustrating and time-consuming. If you’re considering a mobile carrier, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. AT&T used to be known for quality and reliability, but it’s clear that those values have taken a back seat. I’m genuinely disappointed in what this company’s customer service has become.",0
we just switched to At&t  at costco coming from T-mobile the customer service are the horrible we was on the for many hours and days just to exchange  s 24 Plug with abs issue . they still put us on hold for hourswe will look for a diffrence company as soon as possible.,0
"Service was spotty most of the time regardless where any of us on the family plan were. The worst part was leaving. I have been leasing phones for many years with different companies but was never told that my monthly payments was actually a payment plan to purchase the phones instead of leasing them and returning them when I left the company. Now I’m stuck with paying the remaining balance, phones that are glitchy and new phones from the new phone company.",0
"I've been with ATT my entire life.  Their service has been spotty but I've stayed with them bc I thought they were better than others.  Recently, they've been installing fiber optic cables in my neighborhood and have cut my lines repeatedly.  No sooner do they get me fixed than I'm cut AGAIN.  I have to go through their nightmare of what they call ""customer service"" to get my wifi back.  Then, as if that isn't bad enough when I'm on the phone with my ""customer service"" repeatedly i hear a party in the background.  Everyone is laughing, joking, and having a blast...of course, NOT their customer.  I have to stay in for the third time in two weeks, instead of taking care of my business, to be available for their ""technician.""  It's time to dump ATT and find a company that's reliable so that I can have a party of my own .",0
Leaving AT&T they locked my wife's sims card and will not unlock it. New company cannot change. I was on the phone for 4 hours with AT&T couple nights ago no help at all!! I'm at a store and there is nothing they can do. Tried website they gave me but no good says call you new provider. They can't unlock something AT&T did.AT&T is *#%+!!!!,0
Company offers 3 promotions for signing up and has been refusing to give 2 out of 3 of them. I’ve spent over 1.5 hours on the phone with everyone making excuses of why the issue can’t be fixed. Classic bait to get you to sign up and then zero aftercare because you’re stuck in a long term contract.,0
"AT & T is a nightmare. It’s a catch 22 abyss with no resolution and the customer service when you try to resolve issues by calling 611, is hostile, inefficient and uncaring.  Trying to upgrade one of our cell lines. There is a glitch on the account that was placed there months ago . It happened when I attempted to upgrade by phone. Got a person in a foreign country. Almost through with upgrading. Call dropped. Called back . Call dropped again. Went to AT& T kiosk. They couldn’t resolve the issue. They told us to go Corporate store. We did that and they upgraded my phone . But after an hour the same thing happened as at the kiosk. They said there’s a block or note preventing you from upgrading the other line. We can’t help you. You will have to call 611. Total nightmare!",0
AT&T mobile customer is the worst in the world. They outsourced to India. Their customer service doesn’t know and do anything. Complete incompetence and useless. Still tie up with phone payments. If not I a switching to Verizon Wireless. Verizon customer service is world class. ATT provide garbage customer customers.,0
"I moved cell service from AT&T including my watch.  I went to the store to ensure it was done correctly.  I had to go back again because they didn't get it done right.  Once assured all lines, including my watch, were canceled with them (ported out to  T-Mobile) I thought issues were fixed.  9 months later my wife noticed we were still paying $60 a month for the watch.  45 minutes on the phone to the Phillipines and 2 agents later I was told it was my fault for not double checking on the watch.  I told him I did.  They wouldn't return my money for services I never received.",0
"The only reason I’m giving them one star is because I can’t give them zero stars but they suck. They told us to switch to voice data and network from our landline at work because we would have to pay a $500 phone bill versus $80 phone bill and then, we just switch to 5G and I just did the Speedtest and it’s running slower than my phone at like 19 MB per second worst service worst company ever trying to run a restaurant business and not play games I lost thousands of dollars the first day. The new phones came in because they gave the cell phones That weren’t working or half day nobody could call and make any anyways worst experience ever wouldn’t recommend it to anyone on face of planet",0
"I dropped 2 business lines in July. In Oct they finally resolved the problem and the lines were dropped form the account! I then attempted to simply move a line to a personal account ( AARP discount) they moved it to a ""business account""---the foreign rep then moved it back to the original account--each time adding fees!",0
"It should be illegal for them to be throttling their website so much. I could write a better website that loads faster in my sleep.The fact that it takes minutes to load any page, and minutes to load anything inside of the page, means they are doing it on purpose to get people to ignore their plan and simply set up auto pay and drain money from their account.I just swapped phones recently, and have paid my final bill for them. The payment was not too horrible, the customer service over the phone was not too horrible, but the website alone and the app too, oh my god.They are preying on people to give up dealing with their shitty ass website and simply set up auto pay and not leave them. It is actually sad and it should actually be illegal.It does not matter if their web dev team is that bad, at this point its pure negligence and intentional disrespect and illegal predatory misconduct for people that do not understand the internet. Redo the entire website and I will delete my review.",0
"Worst service ever,",0
"As a new business owner, dealing with AT&T has been one of the most frustrating experiences. I've spent hours on the phone trying to resolve overcharges of hundreds of dollars, only to find out they have no record of any previous calls. Reps promise things and never follow up - can’t view my bills in the app, and I haven’t received any paper bills or letters. Then, they suspended my service, wouldn't let me access customer service reps to discuss details of the bill unless I paid a 'convenience fee.' Absolutely unacceptable for any business, especially a new one trying to get started - go to Verizon - wayyyy better!!!!",0
"I’ve been a loyal AT&T customer, but recent experiences with customer service have been disappointing. After four calls in 48 hours, my issue remains unresolved due to outsourced support teams that struggle with language barriers and lack familiarity with my concerns. Cutting costs shouldn’t come at the expense of effective communication and customer satisfaction. I’m now considering other providers who prioritize clear, efficient support.",0
"I've been with ATT for 20 years and they think nothing of loyalty and will not work with you on your payments. I have one line and pay over $100 every month. Service is lacking, signal sucks everywhere and I think I stayed with them over a bad habit than anything. Do not give these people one penny of your hard earned money. There are too many other companies that offer better service and plans. As soon as I get this phone paid off I'm out!",0
"If I could give a -1 rating to AT&T Store 4405 West Wendover Avenue in Greensboro,NC 27407, I would. Beyond terrible. Rude. Not willing to assist. Yanibel was the representative. I will make it my mission to spread the word to anyone I can to not go with AT&T or to leave AT&T.",0
"Worst insurance ever!!!!After having my Samsung galaxy flip4 having shut off when closed, I started a claim with ATT-Asurion they sent me a replacement cell, arrived and looked good I started the long and painful process of moving stuff over about halfway I restarted the phone and after opening and closing the phone the screen bubbled and cracked. I called and started the process of getting another replacement (they kindly said they were waiving the deductible; I was like I would hope so....) then the 2nd replacement arrived. that looked good and after opening and closing it a few times and the screen didn't crack I decided to go ahead and start to move stuff over, at this point I had stuff on the other two phones, important stuff like MS Authenticator and DUO. about 80% of the setup the new, new replacement said out of storage. they sent me a 128GB version instead of the 256GB one that the other cells were. and they won't ship another correct until I return the previous cells, now mind you that I have some of the MS Authenticator and Duo on both phones because after the screen cracked, I stopped so now I have it spread over the cells with issues, and they won't ship a 3rd so that I can set up all the Authenticators... Horrible Horrible, Horrible!!!!",0
AT&T took $1845.15 from my account via automatic pay for a bill their customer service agent in the Philippines told me on a RECORDED line that the charges had been FORGIVEN. I have had a small business relationship with them for over 10 years that is decimated today by this action.,0
"WORST COMPANY EVER...BUYER BEWARE!!!! AT&T got HACKED and my IMEI number was stolen on a phone I was in possession of, bought from ATT and they EVEN showed the DATE I purchased it from THEM, I went to the AT&T store, and showed them I still have the phone and my ID, they said: ""Oh we see where you purchased the phone from us."" I WAS a customer of theirs since 2017.  However, they did nothing to help me get my phone working, I spent 5 DAYS having to take time off work, calling customer service, and going to the store, I spent over $900.00 on this phone FROM THEM, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! I was told ""Sorry you will have to purchase another phone, on the 5th day of missed work because of THEM"" Gee how convenient for THEM! THEY DID NOTHING NO CREDIT, NO let's see what we can do for you since you have been a customer for 7 1/2 YEARS. NOTHING.  No thank you, I switched to MINT MOBILE which is WONDERFUL, Everyone should Switch from TRASH AT&T to MINT MOBILE! SERIOUSLY!",0

Their sales representing stole my phones and never gave me credit. F CK ATT. F cking crooks,0
They double charged me And wouldn't give me any money back and was rude about it would only pay my income bill which hadn't been though of. Then a week later my Internet stops all the same I call for support and they advised me they didn't have enough customers where I live. Btw it less than a mile from the att tower so they can rock on,0
The service on a brand new iPhone works the same with 4 bars as it does with 1 aka it doesn’t work plus the terrible iPhone 15 pro max which is supposed to be amazing can barley do shi with even WiFi it 2024 I would like to open google and make a call on my phone but ig that’s too much to ask,0
"If ONLY I could choose NEGATIVE 5 stars!! This company is a HUGE waste of my time! I cannot believe how many times I have canceled our service and continued to be charged! When I try to call I am put on hold for 30 min at a time! When I schedule a call they call me back, tell me they are unable to help me and put me back on another 30 min hold!! We will NEVER recommend this company to anyone! They are awful!",0

"Terrible experience switching from Xfinity to AT&T. I was at the branch for hours upon hours. They told me my old number was ported when in fact it was not. I traded in my old phone with them, got a new apple watch, with a three year contract based on the premise that I would be able to keep my business number. I specifically asked the employee at the store about keeping my numbers and their importance and I was assured that it would not be a problem. My business number seemed to work for about a half a day. When I was finally able to get on the phone with the porting department to trouble shoot they said the number was NOT ported and I would have to go back to Xfinity and talk with them. Finally got through to the porting department at Xfinity and they said the line was deactivated and there was nothing they could do. So here I am weeks later with no functioning line that im still being charged for by the way. I didn't even get a receipt or email of the service I was getting when I left the AT&T store. I have no way to log in to my new account to see what is happening as none of the log in features are working. I have wasted so many hours of my time using AT&T chat feature, multiple trips to the store, on hold and being transferred from department to department I feel Like I should be sending THEM a bill for my time!",0
AT&T is absolute trash! Mobile service f**king suck and the company should be required to cease requiring payment from any user. You are taking money for a service you are not providing. There is never a reason I should be in my house and not be able to talk on my phone because the other person can’t hear me/I’m going in and out. It is inexcusable for me to have to walk around my house to try and place an outgoing call! Just this morning I attempted to call AT&T over 25 times before my call would actually go through. And they always give the scam excuse of “we’re aware of some interruptions due to us improving our service.” No you’re not! You’re not trying to improve crap - all the company is doing is placing more customers on a network they don’t even have the bandwidth to provide decent service to their already customers.,0
Bought iphone 15 online to be picked up in store attt charged me for it then they cancel the order saying they cant verify it came from me even though i would have to show my identification when i pick it up in store. Now they still haven’t given my money back or a phone,0
"Sandra Carr, from the ""Office of the President"" is a professional con artist.  She raised my wireless price from $50 per month to $78 per month because I filed a complaint against her and AT&T with the Better Business Bureau for scamming with intentional infliction of emotional distress and because I am a senior citizen over 70 years of age and is discriminating against me because of my age and my complaints.",0
"I was at an AT&T corporate store and the associate told me if i switched to AT&T Internet Air my bill would be $35/Month. I accepted this offer as it was better than my current internet bill. I received the router, hooked it up and was happy with the service. Then i got my first bill... $60.00 was taken out of my account. I called customer service thinking it must be a mistake. They claimed that the deal the associate offered me had expired 2 days before i signed up. I told them that seems like an AT&T issue and that its AT&T's responsibility to make sure its employees are offering the right deal. AT&T refused to make it right. They effectively stole money out of my bank account and refuse to make it right. I will be canceling my Phone and internet service and i will no longer do business with AT&T. I would highly suggest avoiding this service carrier.",0
"As of today, 10-19-2024, I had another disappointing experience at the AT&T store located at 2510 S Telegraph Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48302, involving the manager, Jon. I traded in my iPhone 13 as part of the $700 off promotion on the iPhone 16. After setting up my new phone, I asked Jon to show me the promotion details on AT&T's website, citing a past issue where I didn't receive my full credit for three phones at this location. The manager, Forrest Hughes, handled the two phones in 2022. Jon refused to assist me, stating it wasn't his job, and became very dismissive. When I handed him my phone to help find the information, he attempted to navigate the AT&T website for about a minute but couldn't locate the details. At this point, he threw my phone on the table and rudely told me that my previous bad experiences were due to ""bad people"" who didn't represent AT&T.Fortunately, another employee, Aayan, stepped in and found the trade-in information within one minute. Aayan was polite and professional throughout the interaction, which starkly contrasted with Jon's rude behavior.",0
"I just spent about half an hour waiting to get waited on at a local AT&t branch on Holly avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The employee, the one single employee there was shooting the s*** with one of his friends and their son about cars. Everything they loved about cars for 30 minutes. When I left when I finally left, the one employee asked if he could help me for the first time in those 30 minutes. I told him no. If you're going to shoot the s*** with your friends instead of helping a customer, maybe I'm with the wrong company. This is not acceptable.",0
"They baited and switched me by assigning me to a plan I didn’t agree to.  Then, they don’t send out the first bill for more than 3 weeks.  This accomplishes an important task for them.  Every customer has 14 days to cancel their service.  I didn’t know what I was actually being billed for until 23 days into my service.  At that point, they would not acknowledge their mistake, or adjust any charges.  I cancelled my plan, but was still on the hook for the second month because they bill for 2 months in advance.  Even though I’m no longer a customer, I still owe them for month #2 because that’s what I “agreed to”.  Yes, I did agree, but to a completely different plan!  Run away as fast as you can.  They are liars and thieves.",0
I don’t understand why they make it impossible to pay my bill !! I’ve tried for four days to make a payment and because I have a new debit card number it’s impossible to make a payment !! I guess it’s time to find a new phone company. Terrible customer service !!,0
"I've been with the company for 5 plus years and the decided to cut my phone off $4 and refuse to cut it back on, until I pay my next month bill. I'm done with them and will be taking my business elsewhere.....",0
"The customer service rep at Walmart, her name was kristina on sigmon road here in Wilmington, did a lot of talking, and not much of it was true at all. I went through hell for a week returning the phone getting the invalid expired contract null and void, which you would think it already would be since it had expired two days prior to when I signed it. But she took my phone and did all sorts of accounts without my knowledge, and literally turned my life upside down for a week. Do not under any circumstances go with AT&t if you value your money, your hard work, your time etc.. it is not worth it, go with another phone carrier!Date of experience: October",0
Signed up for service and was promised a couple rewards cards valued at $150. Didn't receive them. They don't use a system that tracks deliveries. Told me I had to file theft charges with the police. Shouldn't they have to do that since the items never came into my possession?,0
ATT deserves no stars!!! They prey on the elderly coming into their homes talking them into cutting their land lines and going to a cell phone. Which they already have!!!! But they convinced them they are saving money 😳 Now it going to cost 1000.00 to get out of this mess!!! Horrible heartless phone service people!!! 🤬,0
They are very misleading and will cut your Internet off before the due date,0
Please do not get anything from AT&T I wanted to get some internet and decided to cancel the order before my appointment I call customer service and they fail me with everything about cancellation and my refund for my 100 deposit every representative I talk with gave me the run around they gave me a 1800 number that was no longer in service they also kept going around the fact i wanted my refund they was so quick to take my deposit but didn’t give it back they kept having me on hold and hanging up I call for like a week in a half trying to take care of this matter same thing from different representative no one didn’t help me or tried to resolve this matter customers service sucks they take your money and hold it and try to force you to get everything with them they even ask me what kind of phone I was on like they wanted to block me from calling back about my money and til this day I didn’t receive my money back from them I had to report it fraud to my bank stay away from AT&T,0
Absolutely the worst possible customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. All I was trying to do was order a new iPhone lol and it seemed imposible.,0
Has gone to crap the last 3 years.  About to drop them after 20 years.,0
"I am absolutely appalled by the service I received from AT&T, specifically from a representative named Vanardo. My family and I have been loyal customers for over 20 years, with six premium phone lines, and we expected better than this blatant deception.During our call, Vanardo assured us that we were eligible for completely free upgrades on all our phones. He explicitly stated that our monthly bill included a fee for ""Anytime Upgrades"" and that we had accrued extra credit, making our trades entirely free. Fast forward to now, and I’m trying to ship back our old phones only to discover that there is no shipping label as promised.When I logged into our AT&T account, I was shocked to find that we are being charged full price for the new phones—$38 a month for each of the six phones over 36 months! This is nothing short of a scam. Vanardo's statements were clear, and I demand that AT&T review the recorded call, where all of this misinformation is documented.I spoke with a supervisor (MYLENE) who offered no real help. She claimed she couldn’t access the call transcript but assured me that once they do, the evidence of Vanardo’s promises will be undeniable. It’s infuriating to know that the company I’ve trusted for two decades is engaging in such deceptive practices.AT&T needs to take responsibility for this situation. I expect a full review of this case, a reversal of these charges, and a proper resolution. This is unacceptable, and I will not stand for being misled by your representatives. If AT&T does not take liability for this situation, I will be forced to take my business elsewhere after 20 years.",0
"I went on a cruise. Prior to departure, I purchased att's ""International Day Pass""..., only to find out that this did not cover the period when the ship was actually sailing..., only applied to when the ship was docked at a port. When att informed me of this, I called att customer service to discuss the matter and selected the ""call back"" option in their call menu. So att called me back on what I thought was a toll free number ""+1 (855) 419-7365"" only to be charged $3/min Int'l roaming charge for a total of $84. After the cruise, I called att customer service to remove the charge, but they refused insisting that it was not an att number because att customer service is located in the Philippine islands. The worst part is that the very phone number that they called me back on was again... you guessed it ""+1 (855) 419-7365. Incredible !!!",0
So so bad.   I left ATT 30 yrs ago because they were so awful.    Their automated  AI endless virtual customer service loop is useless.   Trying to reinstall voicemail.   Awful.,0
"Like everyone else, ATT lied to me.  I as due a refund, confirmed by AT&T in writing.  I waited & waited for the refund check that never came, so I called ATT.  They changed their story, I was on the phone for 1 hour & 15 minutes.  I gave up. & hung up.  T Mobile is great!",0
The company offices an unlimited cell services so I had this issue with Metro PCS and they corrected it because I would run out of data for my time was up on my monthly plan I said with your offering unlimited why they need to upgrade my planning from running out of data and they changed it well I'm with AT&T now and I have unlimited but after I pay my bill two weeks into the plan they send me a text and says I'm almost capped at my data but if it's Unlimited I should be capped at all so I have to go make an additional payment to free up more data why do I have to feel more data if it's Unlimited when you try to call them it's hard to get through to them they're trying to capture your line and send you through all these queries and options so you can't even talk to representative they're misleading the public some misrepresentation and I call it fraud and file a complaint with the FCC and the internal General because unlimited it means there's no ceiling on the amount of data you can use but AT&T is manipulating as consumers and this has to stop,0
I would’ve put 0 stars …When opening account representative gave a different amount but when bill came was double amount. Don’t listen to “the special discounts “ it’s a scam . Customer service not helpful.,0
"If I could leave no stars, I would. Worst company overall. So not use AT&T. Stay away. You will be happier for it. They don’t want to be helpful and continue to scam me… I will leave every bad review.",0
"AT&T is the absolute WORST!!! My father in law passed away right after Christmas time in 2023. Unfortunately, right before his passing his cellphone was stolen. We have since been going through probate which has been smooth except for AT&T. Do not ever buy anything from them. First off, they require you to have a PIN. If you do not have this PIN, you cannot gain access to any information. When we first tried to contact AT&T regarding my father in law's passing, we were asked for a PIN. Well, I know this is hard to understand but my father in law is dead and cannot give us his PIN. We guessed every amount of relevant numbers we could thing of and none of them worked. Mind you, we had his social security number, his date of birth, his cremated remains, his mother's death certificate; anything and everything you'd need to resolve these accounts. Instead we were told over and over again that they would send a link to reset his PIN to his stolen phone. It was like a Saturday Night Live sketch where we tried to explain that we didn't have the phone. After almost a year of dealing with them, they have now told us that we need to go into the corporate office to get a letter so that we can give it to our lawyer saying there is no financial responsibility but was told by the staff at the corporate office that without the PIN there is no way to see if there is financial responsibility. So even if we had a check for all the money needed to pay down the account, without the PIN number we would not be able to pay on the account. On another note, one of the employees that works for the corporate office told us that he had the EXACT SAME issue and it took 2 YEARS to resolve!! How is this still an issue with this company?? NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AT&T!!",0
"This is the absolute worst phone company I have ever tried. Lied to me about what my monthly charge would be.I ended up paying 341.00 a month for two phones and a tablet, After being told , it was gonna be about 206. Service was Not great and there was a lot of hidden fees Like The one they Charged Me on my first bill for a hundred and fifty dollars stating it was extra time on my phone plan since I started my plan Before a monthly cycle I would not recommend this company to my enemy",0
"The Internet in my home and the surrounding area has been out for the better part of a week and AT&T either refuses to give me an ETA on when service will be restored or straight lacks the ability to do so. Not knowing on the first day, I'd understand. But a daily text that can be summarized as ""We're really working on fixing it, we promise"" doesn't cut it.",0
The WORST customer service. The obviously out source all there work to low paying countries who barely speak English. Told me they would call me back in a week to help me move my internet to my new home and never heard back from them.,0
"I called ATT help desk. I should’ve have 16 GB 300 dollars payment for a year. They said that I have 8 G 300 dollars. When I did it, I choice 16G not 8. It was their fault to put me on 8G. If you check their website, they have 16G 300 dollars, they didn’t help me to change it to 16 GB. They told me that you will loss all months in your plan if you changed. That is so so so stupid.",0
"Started an account with AT&T.  They came out and installed everything.  The techs that came out to bury the cable buried it two inches into the ground (supposed to be six inches deep).  The next door neighbor's dogs chewed up the wire after that so I lost signal. Two days later, they came back out and reconnected it.  The dogs chewedthrough the wire AGAIN.  I canceled the account.  I was told wouldn't be charged for the week of service I received because of my bad experience.  Three weeks later, AT&T used my banking info to charge my account $262.72, disrupting my finances and causing me to file a dispute with my bank that involved providing testimony, a time-line of events and the receipt from the equipment being returned.",0
AT&T saves a ton of money by asking there customers to have auto pay and paperless billing! They failed to include those discounts for 3 billing cycle to my account but after I inquire about it they can  credit the current billing cycle only. The nerve of these billions dollars companies!!!!!,0
There over the phone support is horrid. 2 hours to get refunded for a mistake they made and they tried to get me off the phone and not refund me several times before finally escalating it.,0
Absolutely horrible customer service. Been deployed overseas and tried to get my phone unlocked which has been a hassle. They said it would take 24-48 hours to get my device unlocked. I have been here a week and they still haven't unlocked my phone and are still charging me $12 a day for international saying it will take 3-5 more business days to review my account and unlock my phone. The worst phone company i have ever dealt with and once my devices are paid off I am switching carriers to a company that actually cares about it's customers!,0
Will leave ATT ASAP. Customer service wanted to debate with me on what kind of ATT store I went to vs fix the root problem which is the information that their stores put out inaccurately. If a store has a big ATT sign it represents the company. Regular end-users do not know if they are contacted or corporate nor should it matter they should give out accurate information. They all told me my day pass for international would cap at 10 days but apparently this is not so for first net.,0
"We live in Queen Creek AZ and our local AT$T promised great coverage and 5g connectivity. All we get, even at home is dropped calls and dead zones for coverage. All over town it’s the same thing. This is the worst service we’ve ever had.",0
Abouslte horrible service and customer service. They will not help you with anything if you have issues. They are just plain greedy. Please choose Verizon wireless or T-Mobile.,0
"Even one star is too much for such a thief company.I am extremely disappointed with my experience with AT&T not only have I been charged with unexplained fees, but the way my device return was handled is unacceptable. I followed their instructions exactly and used the prepaid label they provided to send back my phone. I even have proof of delivery with tracking umber, the original receipt of USPS, yet they are now falsely claiming they never received it.This situation has cost me both time and money, and their customer service has been unhelpful throughout the entire process. Instead of taking responsibility, they are pushing the burden on me, which is absolutely unfair. I trusted them, but unfortunately, this company seems more interested in dodging accountability than resolving legitimate issues and ripping of their customer with lies and nonsense.I would not recommend AT&T  to anyone—be careful if you need to return anything or dispute a charge and for sure they steal your money.Max. Abedian",0
I bought an iPhone 15 pro max about 6 months ago and broke a screen protector about three months in. Brought in and it was replaced without question. I was told they were covered throughout the first year. Broke that new screen protector about two months in again. Went to AT&T where they tried to charge me $10. Saying only the first one is covered. I just bought 3 screen protectors and 3 camera lens protectors for $6.99. Why would I pay 10 for one (with AT&T phone insurance mind you) when I can get 3 of each protector for $7?Their cell coverage has went to hell as well.This was on 10/13/2024.,0
"Tried to restart a plan I had for 15 years with 2 lines, tried another carrier for 62 day The rep  said 59 day is the cut off for reactivation and would not make an exception !!! so I had to start a new account. I  was speaking to was in SOUTH EAST ASIA , I gave my name, address drivers license with expiration date they insisted on my FULL SS, NO WAY, SOUTH EAST ASIA is the capital of identity theft , so unfortunately the call ended with no reactivation,  total BS",0
"It’s Sunday and I call about phone repair and the first thing they should say is our offices are closed (Because how would I really know if they are or aren’t open) But no…. they put you through all the paces…. they ask for the phone number… they check the phone that you’re calling about for Repair. They ask if somebody’s gonna be there when they show up they asked for a number to get a hold of you if need be ….it’s about a five minute  ordeal  and THEN they say “sorry we are closed, call Monday.” Why in the world don’t they just say before  they started the whole conversation “we’re CLOSED today!!!!!”just a waste of my time!",0
I have called multiple times on a billing issue. They never can answer or resolve a simple issue.Unfortunately I just upgraded my phones and am stuck with the bad service for another 3 years-It happens every time- no worse custumer service than ATT.,0
"Unable to change password.  I received notice that my password has been breached so I want to change it.  Using their page, I continually get the ""something went wrong"" message.  Go to service, no numbers to be found.  The most intelligent AI chatbot does not understand ""I want to talk to someone"" and happily points me back to the login page.  It does not work.  Have I been hacked, I don't know yet.  But AT&T surely isn't too concerned if I have.",0
Very very disappointed.in the hurricane time no network .when we needs important time .pay 100$ month not a jokes man.even simple mobile works better they really need to fixed this buks.,0
"I would give them a 0 or F for a provider. After data leak and our bill steadily getting higher for no apparent reason we decided to change companies. At$t told us that they would release our phones in 72 hours when their website says 24 our new phone agent mentioned this to the AT&Tguy and he said no they would not release our phones til the 72 hours are up, then they turned our phones off before the 72 hours were up and still would not release our phones even though they are paid off leaving us no choice but to buy new phones through the new company. They are liars and thieves. It should be criminal. AT&T at one time was a good company, but NOT no more! They will rob you then leave you hanging.",0
I signed up for AT&T a month ago I was guaranteed a price of $69.48 a month. My bill is now doubled that for the first month they took my phone in trade told me they would give me $1000 credit for it and now we’re only offering to give me 200 and change I don’t remember the exact amount but we’ll say $250. They are liars and I’m looking to find out if there’s any class action lawsuits against them that I or we the American people can join,0
"I am very disappointed and I will be signing up with a different cellphone provider. ATT ran a promotion regarding trading in a phone to get the flip phone free. I traded in my phone however, due to the representative at the Southfield store swearing up and down that I was signed in with the correct plan for the promotion, he lied. Even though it was ATT fault they said that they cannot honor the trade in promotion however, you still got my phone. I will no longer like to do business with ATT any longer.",0
AT&T has awful customer service. They are crooks. They charge you when you  are no longer with the company. I transferred over to T-Mobile and AT&T keeps charging me even after I left. I was told to pay the final bill before I could have my number transferred and I paid it. Now the company keeps charging me monthly and late fees. No rep. Can find my account because they closed it out and I cannot see exactly what they are charging me 200$ for. This is not a trustworthy company to be with. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. The government needs to look into how they are  falsely and over charging people who no longer wish to be with the company. I stayed with this company for so long because I wasn’t closely looking at all the things they were doing to my account. When I did realize how they were paying the bill way too early when I had auto pay and the bill kept going up without me noticing it because it was auto pay. Stay as far away from this company as possible.,0
"AT&T internet has the worst customer services/call centered!!!When I moved to this new city, a sales rep knocked on the door and convinced me to sign up with AT&T, what was my nightmare started.First encounter was the monthly bill. I was told was $65 p/m, yet the bill was ~$70 some. I called and told I need to signed up with directly pay by credit card get the discount, I did.The following month however, the bill was higher the previous month. I called again; I was told there was an email sent to me by AT&T regarding the price increase... How could a multi-billion-dollar company jerks up price just like that? nonetheless, the call center guy suggested that If I chose a different plan, it would be cheaper but the same speed, I did.The next month, the bill was even higher but the virtual meetings were hanging. I called, I wanted to use the precious plan when I just signed up. I was told that if you use my bank account for directly pay and paperless, I would pay $15 less each month, I did.This month, my bill was $25 higher... I called for explanation. Again, someone from an overseas call center telling me that all discounts would apply after 1-2 billing cycle, which was the policy. This did not make sense from financial transaction perspective. I argued that the previous guy did not tell me this policy, asked the I was speaking to send me the policy, was told he did not have my email...It has been an on-going frustration with AT&T.Any suggestions for other internet providers?",0
"Unfortunately I don’t have the same experience as most people because I’m a 100% disabled veteran who was ran over twice by two different people, the second of which caused me to have a bone infection and had to have my left big toe surgically removed. During which time AT&T cut off my service. I don’t intend to ever use the company again and don’t recommend it to anyone else because they are not professional or patriotic in any way.",0
"I wish I could rate them 0 stars. The worst phone company by far and their customer support is filled with liars. I've been getting a 1MBPS speed for a few months now and have to rely on WiFi while I pay for their premium internet package. I spent 2 hours in an AT&T store on Sunday to hear from them that I should call 611...then an hour and a half waiting for Tech Support who then says I need Advanced Tech Support and forwards me to the billing department...I wait another 30 mins to be told by the billing department that they are sorry for me and they schedule a call for Tuesday at 2 PM > which is now the loyalty department...who tells me yes sorry but we cant give you any credit (just stick with your 1MBPS and pay for premium package)...let me pass you to Advanced Tech Support > then sends me to home internet after another 10 mins of waiting...and then home internet forwards me to Advanced tech Support...who tell me I need to speak to backoffice support....i am on a call with them right now...SHAME ON THIS COMPANY. If you ever have an option please stay away from AT&T it is by far the worst phone company with a horrible customer support,",0
I paid for service that said I got wifi-calling and for 2 months I didn't have wifi-call.  So in fact they sold me a false bit of good. That is called false advertisement!!!,0
Another one star review for at&t and i don’t feel  about even getting to explain why. The worse many stealer phone company.,0
"Thieves, liars, and manipulators. These folx will say ANYTHING to get you in the door and then steal from you. They lie about everything from costs to speeds to bill discounts. I’ve never dealt with a more f*cked up company and I e we’re with both Verizon and T-Mobile. Shameful service and horrible management that has no idea what they are doing. Absolutely disgusted and now left without any recourse to correct their mistakes. I hope this company takes a nosedive and gets shut down. Won’t happen, but would be great to see.",0
I hit 140 judder bars daily at laeast..in auckand..pissed off..and angry at  and acc.,0
These people are horrible.. T-Mobile is much better. Especially if you need to set up a payment arrangement.,0
Horrrible horrible place!!!! I accidentally suspended my service somehow and for a month it being told it’s being worked on and now I find out after spending hours and hours on the phone that’s it’s gonna be another 3 weeks…. I plan on canceling all my services including my 3 cell lines that I had for 15 years……,0
Terrible customer service . You stay on hold for hours than get transfered to someone to stay on hols some more. Customers time doesn't matter to them at all,0
Got to be the worst service provider ever..3 days of calling to get a Human that could tell me what my next bill will be.Then they say it is a estimated price because the tax and fees change monthly.  IF it is a set billing how can the price change monthly..,0
In/out phone service for a week.... NO SERVICE for last 3 days.... totally unable to make and or receive calls as well as texts.... No cooperation with ATT as rep claims problem has been resolved,0
I am so sick of ATT!! I am trying to leave and carry my number over to another carrier. You would not believe the insane difficulty!!! I have been  trying to do this for 3 days now. It is one thing after another. I don't like being held hostage because I decided to leave. Every time I call in I am placed on eternal hold!!!! For the past 3 days call volumes have been high??? and online there is always some mystery number that is missing so that my request can't be completed. I want to SCREAM. Just let me out!!,0
Purchased a prepaid phone the Ai lady says it's activated and ready but the phone doesn't call out or receive calls  $ 69.24 and still can't make a call no customer service what so ever,0
Would like to when I got service said the bill would be $70 plus tax is well over $90 a month he said it was a free phone but I'm making payments on it each month and a 3-year contract called customer service they were horrible seems like every word comes out of their mouth is a lie,0
They misrepresent them selves.  They tell you one thing then the do another and then they raise your bill and tell you they can't do anything about it.  I was told I was upgrading and lowering my bill then when I get the phones (dont' even unbox them) my bill went up $100 then trying to get it taken care of I am speaking with 3 different reps and they can't keep what they say straight! Besides the fact TERRIBLE SERVICE,0
WORSE COMPANY IN THE USA..........HOURA OF WAIT TO GET THROUGH AI ROBOTS ON A ROUND ROBIN TO GET A SIMPLE ANSWER. ABD ROBOTS THAT LIE ABOUT WAit TO SPEAK TOA HUMAN!,0
"AT&T has the worst customer service and everybody at the store will lie to you to get any results. They can just sign you up so as far as AT&T is concerned, service is definitely the worst people lie to you and their customer service. They don’t even talk to you. I was waiting on the phone for customer service. They said give you give me 10 minutes then an hour later nobody still answered the phone again. AT&T is the worst company ever And they’ve gotten worse and they’re gonna keep getting worse because they don’t care about any of their customers that’s how bad they are now",0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. The worse company and I been with them for years. They charged me for two accounts when I upgraded from uverse to internet air. When caught it, they know the amount they owe, have case numbers, spoke to 6 reps, and still have not been refunded.",0
The problem I have with this company is that they really really really don't want to talk to you. I need to talk to a human being when there's a problem and their menus are designed to avoid that at all costs. I will never do business with them again over this.,0
I came home from work today (Friday) and my internet was down. They said that they wouldn’t fix it until Tuesday. I pay $80 per month for service that is intermittent at best. Wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone.,0
"Honestly for the money they charge for service, including hidden fees and taxes, you would think the customer service would be up to par. My experience with At&t has been miserable. From overcharges, to customer service misinformation, its really sad at the end of the day. Ive only been with them for about 5 months and have been calling for the past 4 months to gain access to my account online because one of their reps decided to input the wrong email for my user id. Which for some reason they are unable to correct over the phone, and insist I go back to the store where I purchased the phone ( I really do not see why it would matter). On top of that every time I do call the customer service line, I risk the chance of the call dropping and having to start the process all over again ( because their customer service reps seem to be operating on a different phone service, and do not hesitate to remind of this possibility every-time I call). My bill should have been one flat rate but since the first month, I seem to owe more and more money. I do not understand how they pride themselves on below standard customer service and robbing people. Say what you want, but I cant wait to switch to another service provider. Its alway a gamble every billing cycle, and they do not seem to care about customer complaints or holding their customer service reps accountable. There service is not worth the money or the time, and they really should hold a company meeting on improving in the customer service area instead of focusing on the profit section for once.",0
"Canceled acct, 6 days into new billing cycle charges me for a full month.",0
"If I can put no stars, I would I don’t know how I came this far but I’ve been with AT&T almost 2 years. I still have a YEAR and 5 months to go Come to find out I’m under a contract that they will not let me get out of. I lost my job due to health issues. they will not let me return the phone, even if it’s in great condition They want to bill me $400 remaining on the phone, but they will not let me return the phone they will not let me leave the contract. I would not recommend AT&T to anybody not even my worst enemy. AT&T sucks, including when I have no service or signal they don’t reverse me What I missed AT&T sucks. Do not I repeat do not switch or make contact with them.",0
I wanted to pay my AT@T Mobility Bill on the telephone. Voice mail said that. To talk to a live representative. You will be charged a $5.00 Dollar convience fee on next bill. We all know that this business already hits us with alot of nonsense fees already. This is unreal. To be charged a convience fee to pay your bill.,0
Those scammers told me that they owe me money but instead they charged me 150 even though it was supposed to be 80. If AT&T is watching this get ready to shut down this crapcompany I will be sure you will get no money forever but start owing the people more than billions,0
Worst company ever I never activated service and sent equipment back and never got a refund and talk to corporate this is embarrassing and shameful at this point I just want a refund I canceled everything ypu all should be fired for not doing your job and adjusting my billing this is wrong on so many levels,0
"I have constantly had problems with ATT service. Earlier this week, I visited the ATT store to upgrade my phone and was good to go but told that my trade in would gain $600 if I fixed the screen so I went and paid $220 to have it repaired. Then I returned and was told then that it wasn’t eligible. I had to visit the store two times to try to upgrade, eventually ending in a conversation with ATT customer service, as the store advised, before finally getting told that their system was the problem and there was nothing they could do. My phone has been paid off for nearly a month and they could see it on their end, but couldn’t do anything. I was told wait another month and try again.This is just one time of many that I have had issues. The last time I upgraded, I was told that I needed to switch internet plans and the rate was set but it went up after a month (nearly $30!).I’m officially switching to a company that is cheaper and easier to work with. There are SO MANY options that are cheaper than AT&T.",0
"I have been on/off the phone with AT&T since noon today. They have disconnected me three times. I'm simply trying to set up a new LAND LINE service for my mother, who is a senior and disabled. She cannot use a cell phone. They keep trying to get me to buy a flip phone, add internet, or add direct tv. This is not a service that is available to do on their website. You have to call. I have explained, re-explained and explained again. I have had a call back that I've waited 40 minutes for and then when I'm transferred, I get disconnected. I have been on the phone now for 27 minutes, have spoken to two separate people and nobody seems to understand what I'm trying to do, which is really, really simple.",0
Wish I had read these reviews sooner.Trying to get service to our house has been a nightmare. It's been over a week with no internet and can't get a service person to come out within the time frame that they quoted us.Service was awful and wouldn't make us a priority on their service schedule any of the other days.Will be looking for new provider. Do better.,0
They suck !!!!!!,0
"If I could give zero stars, I would.  Alexander Graham Bell would be so ashamed that the company he founded has zero integrity today!!The company changes their operating systems without notifying customers.  And, I strongly believe that this is in an effort to have customers enroll in auto-pay or be charged a service fee for having a customer service rep process the payment.  I, for one, will never enroll in auto-pay with AT&T as I do not trust them!!For years I have paid my internet bill through the automated system.  Then since the last 6 months or more each time I call the system automatically routes me to a live agent. None of the reps with whom I spoke since this started happening was able to explain why this was happening.  Finally, today I got a rep who explained that the system started linking my phone number with an account I had some time ago for phone services (and which I no longer have).  Now, I would have to key in the account number for the internet service.This is not the first time that shady ATT changed their system and created confusion and frustration for customers. For over 10 years I had been paying my bills thru the auto system using a bank account and had never used the 4 zeros with which the account started.  Suddenly last year, the auto system could not recognize my banking info.  Almost a year and several calls later, I was told that I now had to key in the 4 zeros.If the company truly cared about the customers, we would be notified when these changes are made.  Or at least, the customer service reps should be properly trained so that they can resolve these issues for the customers.",0
"AT&T is a sorry excuse for customer service! I wrote a review a week ago. I want to know how to get in touch with corporate. They need to train their customer service team in having respect. Ask me if you can call me Lisa. I went on the Crap App to upgrade a phone and for 45 minutes I couldn’t find the line I wanted to upgrade. It kept bringing me back to my line. All the devices should show up anyway.  Then I do the surveys and it still doesn’t touch on the issue I had. I was going to put it in the comments, but it shut me down before I could. I would change my service but I don’t trust I will get a better service.🤷",0
Well I had to hook up a line just to see if I had service! Found out I did so after 5 days I switched from Verizon to AT&T and now they sent me a bill for 303 plus 139 and they will not help me figure out why or how to fix it!! It’s true what they say grass is not greener on the other side!! Customer service is horrible!! Service is mediocre at best!! I would highly recommend a different provider!! Wait times are insane,0
"Don't get involved in AT&T.international conversation, they charged 125 dollars, then we canceled it, they issued an invoice of about 500 dollars without any evidence, in short, they bring your money to the game and take it from your pocket, international conversation is free in other operators, so stay away from ATT",0
"You must be very careful with this company and the extra charges they put on your bill. It is very important that you know that even if you are using your phone in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi they will still charge you for roaming. Their operating mode is to steal in one way or another.",0
"I am with an AT&T customer service for about more than an hour and the lady her name is Heidi, her expertise level is zero. She doesn't know about anything. She is doing nothing but putting me on hold.",0
AT&T is an absolute garbage company multi million dollar company and its service is garbage hundreds of s Signal towers all over the fück!ņg city and its service is still ass. It can’t play a simple video from the comfort of your home and will take five years to load. I’m pretty sure some cheap ass company like cricket or mint mobile has better service than AT&T. I’m so fed up with this garbage ass service.,0
"On 9/18- I tried to upgrade my Google pixel 6 pro to a Samsung Galaxy 24+ online. I had problems, so I had to contact AT&T via chat. They called me and did the entire transaction including payment. It went easy and I received the phone on 9/23. I did my data transfer and put in my sim card on 9/25, immediately my account was shut down at 6:15pm. I didn't understand what happened, so I had to use another cell phone to contact AT&T. It took 20 mins to get a rep on the line.She went through my acct, saw I owed nothing (I always pay my bills on time) and then asked me if I reported a lost/stolen phone. I told her no. She asked me if I had the Google pixel 6 pro and Samsung 24+ phones in front of me and I told her yes. She said ok, but she couldn't fix my acct she would have to transfer me to technical support. This took 45 mins.Technical support came on the line and started interrogating me. He asked me where I bought the phone, how did I do the transaction, when did I get it. I had to read the EID numbers off each phones and then he put me on hold, then he came back to ask me more questions. At this point I got upset, I told him to review their records since AT&T did the transaction, they sold me the phone, they sent me the phone, they should have everything in their records so stop interrogating me and look everything up. He put me on hold again and eventually came back on the line to tell me, he is sorry- on Sept. 17th; the phone they sent me was reported stolen. However, it was taken back to the store and then sent to me. When I put my sim card in the phone, it shut down my account since now it looked like I stole the phone.I told him, ok how are you going to fix this since I also use my phone for work. This is unacceptable. It took him another 25 mins to get my acct on line, so my sim card could work in my old phone. I had to drop the ""stolen phone"" to the UPS store so they could receive it(on 9/26).I called them today, 9/30. Another process getting them on the phone. Another issue getting them to recognize that they now have the ""stolen phone"" which they have now even started to process. The phone is still on my acct. Even though they admit this is completely their fault once again, I can't get a new phone or have anything done for another 7 days. Then, they will give me back my money and I will have to redo the process again myself.Throughout this entire process, all I'm getting is empty apologies. No recourse for their actions. Since they will not send me the phone I actually paid for, they will have to refund my money. They will not re-send me the samsung 24+ phone, because even though they admit they sent me the ""stolen phone,"" on my account it looks like I used a stolen phone; therefore now even once they clear it, they can't do anything.I don't want anything to do with a company that treats customers like criminals, when the company makes a mistake. Once I get my money, I'm going to Verizon or Team Mobile. Just wanted to let the public know. Great customer support AT&T, you really show much you value our time and business.",0
"(Pun intended)  HORRIBLE customer service.  Several minutes to try and wade through an automated answering system which cannot understand you.  And Heaven help you if you don't have a problem that fits neatly into one of their little categories - because at that point, the automated service will say to you ""Sorry you're having trouble.. Please try again later..""   And that's it  - You're done.On the occasions when you DO reach an actual human.. they are half a world away, with accents so bad that you cannot understand them, and ending up spending an inordinate amount of time asking them to slow down - WHICH they will confuse with ""Speak Up"".  At which time you have to remind them that you can Hear them just fine... It's not a volume issue.  It's a diction issue.  And that's when they break into 'script' mode.  They communicate by reading from that script... and CONSTANTLY ""thanking you for that information"".  And then eventually hanging up on you.I Called the toll free number that was ON MY LAND LINE BILL - spent 30 minutes trying to explain my issue to someone who had zero working knowledge of the language.. only to find out .. .that he was SOMEHOW with the cell phone division.  And so, I got to begin the process all over again.Issues that could be handled in a matter of minutes will often take hours because of this.  AT&T is essentially giving a big middle finger to it's client base, saying .. .""There's not much you can do ..  as WE are a shining monument to what can be accomplished when there is virtually NO Competition.""There are over SEVEN THOUSAND negative reviews on Trust Pilot alone - this should be some indication that AT&T isn't about to fix a thing.  I would consider letting AT&T know about my review, as TP suggests.  Why bother... it's clear they don't care.",0
"Bad service, 2022 still 5Ge omg you know e mean that is 20 years ago , 5 lines $150 but tax high total bills will be $245, internet super slow cant loading Facebook , send iMessage picture take forever, if you send more then 3 pictures that mean failed cant sending, now 36 months contract, not like what agent said, i used Tmobile before, Tmobile the best price, no tax at all , super fast internet .

Hurricane Helene victim here. ATT is NOT helping hurricane customers!,0
"We were sold ATT cellular at $120 p/m for 4 lines and new iPhones included.  We were happy with T Mobile at $170 but saving $50 per month and getting new phones is a good deal.  After several weeks of hell it’s apparent that the sales rep lied through his teeth.  Our bill is well into the high $200s and as of yet no one can really confirm what it will be in the end, but it certainly won’t meet his written quote.  ATT keeps giving us different stories and can’t seem to confirm anything.  This is just an atrocious con and the salesman and his supervisor have ghosted us.",0
"Customer service is absolutely garbage,  is so full of *hit that is about to explode,  worse than you can imagine!!!!",0
"Everything they say is a lie. Signed us up and then literally 30 later everything was not as they said. We signed up with Ashley in Friendswood, TX. He drove around in a BMD in our neighborhood. HE LIED. HE SET UP OUR ACCOUNT ALL WRONG. In the end we are paying TWICE as much as the rate we had a Tmobil, service is terrible, and every month is more bs charges we have to call and fight. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST.",0
"ATT was hacked twice and even didn't notify customers for a few months. ATT doesn't protect customer's personal info. I receive a lot of scammers calls, I block them, even don't answer, but other similar numbers continue bothering me. I receive creepy text messages of unknown people pretending than they know me. ATT have to clean up their system of dark web,scammers,spammers and other criminals. It isn't safe to use ATT already. It hurts businesses, people, consumers, economy....Yes, because people are SCARED to answer and be comfortable in ATT system. Even now,posting this,I am worried that scammers don't use my e-mail address just because ATT don't care!!!  Thanks.",0
"Once again AT&T is failing me. If you use AT&T cell services, you cannot reach my office phone. It goes to instant fast busy, AGAIN!! There is some glitch and AT&T and our VIOP provider both are pointing fingers at each other. "" Its their fault "", meanwhile,  I still can't reach my own office from my cell. What a frustrating and utter failure AT&T and DataTalk Telecom / Intermedia  have been for us. If you run a business,  who do you use for Voice Over IP?  This has happened multiple times, with hours and hours of arguing and chasing tails on the phone.  Customer service sucks! Automated system sucks. People who can't speak or understand clearly as phone techs, SUCKS! Your inability to recognize and remedy an issue like this is insane andpathetic.",0
"I was in Walmart when an AT&T associate stopped me and offer me a ""FREE"" phone. He said that I have just to move my line from T-Mobile to AT&T and I will get the phone for free. I started the process and before finish he told me that I have to trade my iPhone 14 Pro Max. I asked him if he is crazy because I never would do that. I called the Walmart Manager and he made him cancel everything. But I start to receive an activation bill from AT&T. I went back there and he called AT&T and did not fix it. I called AT&T and I experience the worst costumer services in the world. They left me waiting for 57 minutes and hang off the phone. I called so many times and they do not solve the problem. If this goes to my credit I will take them to the court.",0
I hate everything about Att home internet service! When I moved in my apartment complex I learned they contract with Att & only offered service through them. I never wanted Att & it has been terrible ever since! They add fees to everything to where I’m stuck paying 90 dollars for basic internet. They even charge if they take your payment on line. Spectrum would never! I’m starting a petition where I live to allow spectrum. Do not recommend att for anything,0
This is the worst company I have ever hadEvery time I want to talk to a customer service it takes forever and once I get through its the same old excuse as to why I have no service every afternoonWorks great in the morning but nothing once it hits 3 pm and onI will not be paying this company anymore moneySo if they turn me in to collections so be itI'm going to file a complaint with BBB and see what I can get doneI would not recommend this company to anyone,0
"We had AT&T wireless for 8 months, and the service was SO TERRIBLE, we needed to switch back to TMobile. We asked AT&T to unlock our phones 3 days before the end of the billing cycle, so we wouldn't get charged for another month. But sneaky AT&T would not and did not unlock our phones until the first day of the new billing cycle, when we were finally able to free. THEN, they charged us $125 for the new billing cycle, even though they held our phone numbers hostage beyond when we asked for termination. Seems like fraud to me!!",0
At&t refuses to unlock my phone that  i own and tried to extort me for 6 more months of service to unlock.  This is grand larceny.  Extortion scheme.  And overpriced garbage service.  Youre welcome.,0
"Lindsey came to my house on 4/12/24 offer a $1000 gift card. I’ve received $800. I have called rewards and they say it has to come from Lindsey, Lindsey refused to answer up till today. She provided me her boss email. I got the first gift cards around the end of May. June 4th she “submitted a ticket” and said the card was shipped but never activated. Since June I’ve heard no contact till today and she was very demanding on not speaking with me. I’ve emailed her “boss” and no luck.. this company offers false promises.

AT And T is a scam company.  Told bill would be cheaper than Verizon.  Almost triple now.  Run from this company while possible.  Nothing was explained properly.   Turned in old phone like was told.  Did not get any credit like I was told I would,0
"AT&T customer service is the worst in the world. Crazy security validation, very long wait before speaking to someone and the rep is completely useless, unable to provide services or done anything right. Extremely frustrating calling their customer service. I have avoid calling them at cost except emergency issues. Worst in the world.",0
The only reason I gave AT&T one star is because I made me they don't get any stars. The employees they have working for them don't know what they are doing and they can't even understand what you are saying. I swear I was talking to a 10 year old no a 10 year old would do better then the AT&T employees. I was on the phone for 2 hours the other day I asked the employees over 30 times to transfer me to a manger. Every time he would ask a question I asked for a manger. I can't wait to switch provider's I hate AT&T and i'm going to put up a bad review everyday to get the word out. AT&T is a scam don't set your account up on auto they will go in your account and take what they want when they want. And they when you want your money back they will take for ever to refund. Or they will keep you on hold for hours because they know people don't have time to hold for  2 hours about a refund. They took $222 on 9-12-24 and they weren't suppose to take it till 9-20-24 then they were suppose to refund but I never got the refund and they wanted me to pay again on 9-20-24. I think the employees do it because they have no idea what they are doing. They have a AI note the accounts so their job all they have to do is talk on the phone and the AI notes the account for them and they still can't do their job right. AT&T sucks run don't use their service for cell phones or internet unless you like finding out where you money went and spending hours on the phone because nobody knows what to do,0
"I would leave them less than one star if I could. AT&T is one of the worst companies to do business with all the way around. Their service sucks, their customer service sucks and their business policies suck. I am not sure if anyone else has had this happen but I purchased phones from them on the next plan where I traded in phones to get the new ones and was to be paid a certain price for my phones. Well they were paying me monthly for the phones and then the service went bad as many people have experienced lately, so I cancelled my service and got a REAL service provider well at that point they charged me for the phones I had which I have no problem with but in turn they kept my phones I traded and now does not want to pay for them. I am trying to begin a class action lawsuit against them so if this has happened to you please let me know so you can be added.",0
Customer Service is the worst! We experience issues when trying to call out. Get a message that my phone is not registered to a network.  We have called multiple times. They have us make a few changes then restart phone and calls work until the next time I try to make a call. I shouldn't have to restart my phone every time I want to make a call or send a text. I called again yesterday and complained about the issue and why I pay so much money for such bad service. I was blatantly lied to by the rep. Was told the reason is because my payment is 5 days late. This issue has gone on for a lot longer than 5 days! Looking for new cell phone service now!,0
"We had a sales lady come to our home to switch from verizon to AT&T. We were excited to hopefully have better service in our area. With this being said our AT&T represenative was very nice and you could tell she was frustrated as well.  She arrived at 5pm and at 10pm still at our house and had to leave and none of our phones had been ported over. For my job I can't be without a phone. By noon the next day my phone was working but the other two on the plan were not. Around 24 hours later another line was working but my husbands was not. Several days go by and unfortunately as this time i receive a text that my husband has a new line and he needs to activate his phone. My husband some how loses his phone and so AT&T states to file an insurance claim. What no one tells you is that if the phone has been used then insurance won't replace it.... So after hours of speaking with AT&T and getting no where I had to purchase a phone out of pocket... Yes I understand my husband lost his phone and that is his responsibility, but if he had service and was able to use it then he probably wouldn't has set it somewhere and left it. It is frustrating to be told one thing and then have to deal with the extra. I should have stayed with Verizon. Unfortunately I will be staying with them. I was excited to be back with AT&T and it definately was a rough experience.",0
"I have cancelled their service on 8/5/2024 and have followed their instructions to return the equipments at a UPS store with my account number on 8/6/2024. I am grateful to the UPS staff who reminded me to keep the return receipt for 2 years, as AT&T may try to claim that I did not return the equipment.On 9/8/2024, I received a reminder email from AT&T claim that my AT&T equipments haven’t returned. The day after, I went to the AT&T store and spoke to the staff. They suggested me go back to the UPS store and check with them. Despite providing them with a receipt to proof the equipments were returned, they were unable to check for me as they claimed to not have contact with UPS. After spent over 30 minutes on the phone with them, they assured me everything was taken care of and made a note on my account.After a week - 9/15/2014, I receiving a reminding email again. I did not take any action as I assumed they needed more time to update their system. Unfortunately, I have now been charged a non-return equipment fee of $200. I have attempted to resolve this issue by reaching out through chat, but the virtual agent was not helpful in resolving the issue.This situation is frustrating and time-consuming and could have been easily avoided if AT&T had properly handled the situation. It is unacceptable for a company to charge customers for returned equipment, especially when proof is provided. This not only causes inconvenience for the customer but also wastes their valuable time and resources. It is important for companies to uphold their promises and provide efficient and satisfactory customer service.",0
"ATT customer is the ABSOLUTE worst that I have ever encountered. I own a business and if my customer service was as bad as ATT I would be out of business.  An ATT representative disabled my ATT.net email while trying to make another change three days ago.  So far I have spoken with literally 17 customer service reps, chatted online with 5, and visited my regions ATT corporate store.  And after spending HOURS AND HOURS ON HOLD, have not received one bit of assistance in fixing the problem.  Went back to the corporate store today and complained to a manager (the assistant store manager - Jonesboro, AR) about the horrible customer service.   His reply was that if I didn’t like the service to go somewhere else.  After three days of this…I AM BEYOND READY TO CHANGE CARRIERS!!!!  I need access to my email NOW!!!!",0
They don't let you easily cancel your internet service even if you have moved out ! They make the process challenging. You have to call many times. Not nice! Not ethical!,0
"AT&T's chat/call centers appear to be staffed by poorly trained people reading scripts. I suspect, based on some of the weird nonsensical answers, they are also using AI chatbots. AT&T's poorly trained staff are forced to deal with its poorly designed systems. Did an agent accidentally not activate your eSim properly while you're chatting with them and then pass you off to another agent? No problem, the new agent can (and must) text you a new PIN number and try the process again. You can't receive a text because your eSim wasn't activated? Well gosh, there is ABSOLUTELY nothing that can be done without visiting an AT&T store in-person. Want to go before work? Tough luck, they all open at 10 or 11 in the morning. Once an impasse like this is reached, you will be handed off (with no warning) to another agent who also can't help you. I went through 3. The last guy finally gave me a phone number for the ""Advanced Technical Team"". The message at that number said it closed in February of 2023. Here's the number: 888-855-2338, listen for yourself. Also, frustratingly, no part of AT&T is connected to any other part of AT&T, so enjoy repeating yourself.",0
"I recently switched from T-Mobile to Att a few days ago.  I had no idea att customer service was the worst experience I’ve ever had or I would have never switched.  I accidentally ordered the 256GB iPhone 16 but I wanted the 1TB iPhone 16.  I have called att for days, the customer service either can’t find my account, can’t find my order and when they do find something, something happens such as they cannot complete the exchange and will to call me back the next day to finish it or the call ends, it’s like they give up because they are lost and don’t know what to do.  And all the waiting made the wrong phone ship, so all that time wasted now I have to send the phone back, trying to contact att to send the phone back and do an exchange is a nightmare.  The incompetent customer service representative wastes an hour of my time by asking questions and keep asking me what I wanted to do and told me to call sales and gave me the number to call,  so after all that time wasted I call sales,  guess what?  I need to call customer service to do this.  So I call customer service AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! I wait on hold because their customer service is really bad so after 30 minutes of waiting the call fails.  This is really ridiculous.  I didn’t even add to this message the other days of back and forth with sales and customer service.  It’s no surprise to me ATT have majority 1 star ratings, doesn’t surprise me at all from what I had to experience just to exchange a phone.  I haven’t even been able to exchange it yet due to the many hours or waiting on hold or answering the same stupid questions over and over and their computers must be from 1980 because it takes them forever to look up anything on your account!!!!!  I wish I knew about this before switching, I would have stayed with Tmobile, it’s not worth this headache and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to exchange the phone with the way things are going,  it should not be this hard or complicated.",0
"Their customer service is the worst. I spent months, hours trying to get a credit due sent to me.  They kept passing me off to different people until I figured out they were just trying to keep from sending me the refund.  Waste of my time and they basically ripped off the money due to me because I gave up with the roundabout treatment they gave me which I feel is a trained tactic so as not to pay. Never use ATT again!",0
GARBAGE COMPANY. Can’t wait to get Verizon. I don’t even know why I gave these guys a chance what a joke. I didn’t know I would be charged for international minutes at 3 dollars a minute! A 30 minute phone call cost me almost a 100$ and they won’t waive it. Goodbye never EVER again.,0
"I signed up to trade in our phones, but then we changed our minds and cancelled the trade 3 days later. However, they still sent the phones. We asked them to email us return labels for all the phones, and we sent them back. Despite this, they still ported all my phone numbers to their network, leaving us without working phones. Now we are trying to get our numbers back. This company is a scam – stay as far away from them as you can.",0

We were incorrectly charged $199 for service transfer when we moved. Two representatives informed us by phone that there would be no charge for the U-Verse move. The retention department would not remove the fee even after we requested cancellation.,0
"I have started receiving alerts from my PPI monitoring services that my PPI was compromised during the AT&T breach upon which the alerts I received actually showed the information that was compromised. I called AT&T customer service upon to simply let them know and ask for the service they were providing to address the leaked PPI.When I spoke to a representative, I was told unless I knew the exact date my information was leaked AT&T's position is to not take responsibility for removing the compromised information from the Dark Web because their investigation revealed SS# were only leaked on specific dates.  I confirmed my understanding with the customer service representative and again asked for clarification that it is the position of AT&T not to take the due diligence to remove the information that was leaked. Again I attempted to explain I am receiving alerts  from my current monitoring services that are showing me what is out there with AT&T being the source.  Obviously. The representative was just following company procedures.  However, he offered no assistance, no customer service, no compassion, or concern for the situation AT&T is responsible for, other than to insist it couldn't be AT&Ts responsibility.  I have had AT&T cellular services for over 20 years. This is the third data breach with the company. Surprisingly, I havent had data breach issues of this severeity from all the other business and platforms I use, but have had three with AT&T.  AT&T is the only data breach that I have had that actually has mishandled my PPI that is vital to my identity verification. The company offered no incentive for their negligence to me. Their customer service was less than helpful, offered no possible course of action, did not have the knowledge/skills/desire to help educate me or even make any considerate attempt to reassure me if I have further troubles with this matter Att will be there to assist me.  Thus, I am responsible for the expense and detriment without so much as a concern from any company representative or the company itself.  My work phone is through another carrier who doesn't seem to have the blatant disregard for providing valued customer service or do they have repeated data breaches that have impacted me. Needless to say, it's been my personal experience there are better options for cellular services providers.",0
Horrible customer service constantly raising prices.It actually seems Like they are intentionally try too loose customer's .,0
worst customer service ever did lie about your charges. never get AT&T service it's a waste of time and money,0
AT&T has the very Worst Customer Service In the Country!!! When you call it is Next to Impossible to Get A Live Representative without going through the Virtual Assistant Giving You the Run Around. There App is Absolute Crap and is the Same! I’ve been with them 22 years and they want you to pay automatically! I don’t do automatic payments to anyone except my Life Insurance! I absolutely Despise Calling Them! They make to much Money to have   Poor Service like this🎉💙🎉💙,0

"If I can give them -* I willTerrible Service and Zero Resolution – A 7-Month NightmareI’ve been an AT&T customer for years, but the past 7 months have been a nightmare. I have had no service outside, meaning I can’t receive calls, use GPS, or access the internet. This has severely impacted my life, especially since I have kids and need to be reachable in emergencies. Despite calling customer service countless times (each call lasting 3-4 hours), I’ve been bounced from one department to another with no solution.To make matters worse AT&T has been raising my bill every month with no explanation, and they even charged me for international plan when I couldn't even use the service nationally! How am I supposed to use the service international when I can’t even get a signal here at home ?I’ve even gone to the store multiple times, only for them to call customer service again, wasting my time. Today, when I went back, the representative I spoke to was not only unhelpful but also rude in custome rcare her name is wanda i believe. I’ve been more than patient, but this situation has been completely unacceptable.I’m tired of paying for a service that I can’t use. I just want to return my phones and move on, but I’m worried about how it will affect my credit if I stop paying. AT&T’s lack of care and customer support has been incredibly frustrating, and it’s clear that they do not prioritize resolving customer issues. Save yourself the headache and go with a provider that actually values its customers.",0
Customer service is a robot. Can’t talk to a human about complex problems.   Worst experience ever,0
Worst company I have ever used.Worst customer service ever. Our bill went up almost double after less than a year. I had to cancel the account and paid them $2900 for early cancelation penalty. For 15 months I keeps on calling them to get the phones I had paid thousands of dollars for unlock so I can use them with the other carrier but could not get it done. They would make you wait on the phone until you hang up yourself.,0
"The service has gotten worse and worse over the years. If it did not work at our vacation house, we would dump AT&T in 3 seconds.",0
"Cancellation put in after years of service with them we switched due to high fees and sub par service.  Called and cancelled per stores request only to get another bill and stayement showing they didnt cancel the line.  They said their AI showed no record of the call. I told him I would screen shot the call log where I had a 23 minute conversation with the lady. He said again no record or the call, our AI would have registered it.... they will not credit the bill back. Garbage company. Look elsewhere",0
Terrible Company. Forced to have them for internet through apartment complex. I guess their terrible treatment of their workers led to a strike and that's why I haven't had internet for a month. Couldn't recommend them less. Very unreliable.,0
I have a problem with my phone I called  and was on hold for 1 hour then put on hold again for 45 minutes for them to transfer me! Then on hold off and on for the next hour while they ran test on my phone.

Terrible customer service!!!,0
10 word minimum.I switched over to AT&T from metro.They promised me a free iPhone 15 pro.I've been charged $27 for 4 months now after l've already sent in my iPhone. The accredited themselves 60 more days to get the iPhone after they sent me a shipping label for the wrong address. Idk where they shipped my iPhone to and I'm still paying for a phone they told me was free. After confronting them 2 times they said they can't do anything for me. Once this is Done I will switch back,0
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OUT SOURCE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO OTHER COUNTRIES 2 1/2 HR WASTED AND STILL NO CLEAR ANSWER ON IF IM ELGIBLE TO TRADE MY PHONE IN AND GET AN UPGRADE. SHAME ON YOU ATT. I WILL BE TAKING MY 15 BUSINESS LINES SOMEWHERE ELSE.Rep # ML0516 Anna in some foreign country,0
"AT & T (and I bundled TV and Internet with them for many years), about every two years would have a ""promotion"" and at the end of the two year promotion, I would have to negotiate with them because they would raise their prices up higher.  I was paying $205 a month, and now they want $253 a month or $572 additionally for a year!  Used to be a customer could talk and negotiate with a American Supervisor, NOT anymore, now you have to talk to a foreign representative who will NOT reduce your bill and the 2 year set promotions are apparently over with.  I am going to another cable and internet provider because AT& T, is toooooo greedy and now tooooooo foreign!  So they will LOSE $2460 a year by refusing to lower their bills, even for retired people on fixed incomes.  All AT & T is now, is a despicable and greedy Company!",0
"I'm only giving a 1 star because that's as low as I can go. I am totally frustrated with the rates, bill, service and customer service with AT&T. I am exhausted with calling them every month because of billing.  They charge you ten dollars if you dont sign up for paperless billing and AutoPay.  What a rip off! Not to mention all the blackouts they have. Maybe this is a sign to read books, because internet alone almost $100 a month & that's CRAZY WORK! No perks for your loyal customers,  all the so called ""deals"" are for new customers only! Do better AT&T & Execitives. I am livid with this trashy service & sky high pricing.",0
Worst customer service ever.  Our bill ended up being $60 more than they promised and our 1st bill was over $900 which is absurd. We had to file a complaint with the FTC to get this fixed.  Since then our bill has been slowly going up with no explanation and when you try to get someone on the phone you can't get past the automated system.  I absolutely hate this company and as soon as the contract is up I will switch and never go back.,0
AT&T has been a nightmare for me all morning they mislead me in paying a bill to get my services restored. They transferred me all over the place and completely lied to me…I was told once I paid the bill in full I would keep my services…I’m a single mom in this terrible economy and for them to lie and not give a clear understanding and take the last money I had for me and my family is the lowest of the lowest…I need my services in order to take care of my family and they just took my money in five mins and I have been trying to get services rerouted for four hours….i will never recommend this service to anyone…if anything I will slander the AT&T name and make sure they go completely out of business due to their lack or consideration and knowledge for its customers,0
Our reviews don’t seem to matter but hear goes. It is a nightmare calling customer support. You can barely understand anything the customer service clerk is saying and on top of that nothing is never really settled. I moved and wanted my service stop at one address and started at my new one. It’s bad enough I had to wait three weeks to get an appointment for someone to come out and hook up my internet. Each time I checked they still had my old address as the service address.,0
If I could leave negative stars I definitely would att worst cellphone service ever have had phone two months and have had nothing but problems no service dropped calls terrible mobile data no help from customer service,0
"I signed up for a trade-in with the deal where I was promised a credit on the bill; it has been seven and no credit, according to AT&T. They never received the divas.I've contacted customer services multiple times, and according to them, they never received my devis. No one is responsible.Waiting for them to help you can be hours, and customer service repeats the same thing: sorry for the inconvenience, but you know they don't care.In the future, I will be rethinking to do business with them.",0
"AT&T has to be the WORST phone service EVER!So... I returned my step-up (old phone) to AT&T on May 23rd.  For whatever reason, @USPS didn't register the track# of the phone until August, which puts me 60 days behind from not returning the phone. Mind you, I do have pictures & proof of when I sent the darn phone. AT&T still charged me $228 for a phone I no longer have for nonreturn.The worst part is, today 9/17/24, I just found out that AT&T DID receive the phone & is sending it back to me, instead of crediting my acct the $228 they now have in their possession...reason: ""It didn't qualify for the 30-day return""I told the ""Loyalty"" dept I needed to cancel my service & send their new phone back.  The lady told me, that if I sent the new phone back, AT&T would only apply $520 for it, as it is what the ""phone is now worth"" & I'd still owe them $742 for both phones, they would now have in their possession!!!  :((HOW ABSURD & UNFAIR IS THIS???? 😡They didn't even try to save me as a customer with all the proof they had or offer the credit to keep me 😡Since they wouldn't credit my acct & still have the phone, I cancelled it & I'm taking them to small claims court.Why wouldn't they credit my acct if the proof was there?  They know @USPS is known to be trying to steal people's mails/packages",0
"Tried getting the names switched on the AT&T account an they screwed up so bad that it took 3 weeks plus 4 hours of failed attempts with the crap customer service, Apparently you now have to install your own router after their circus act an it’s $70 for that trash service so don’t waste your time with them you’ll regret it. Can’t believe AT&T is this bad an still waiting for my stupid new router 🤬",0
"we paid for 1 mounth prepaid service, but there no reception  in my house, only in the yard. 3 days later we wanted to get money back for 27 days but AT T keep our money. AT and T STOLE from us. Shame on you for stealing our money.",0
I was supposed to get a free phone due to a fathers day promotion. I've been paying for the new phone for 4 months now. I've been to the store multiple times and on the phone with customer service. The store tells me to call cust. serv. and cust serv. says to go back to the store. Do not believe any of the so called promotions they offer. I will be changing to verizon or some other carrier soon. I've been trying to resolve this issue for 4 months now. By by At&t.,0
"It's been a week without internet, my bill has been paid in full and early.I understand the company technician were on strike.I am a very punctual person. If you say your coming between 8 and 12 I expect you to be here! ITS 12:38 AND YOU don't  even have a technician scheduled to come out.Im not angry, but mess around and find out! I'll fire you and do business with another company.I have Star link in mind!",0
"It took me two days and over 8 hours on the phone with customer service to get an iPad unlocked. The experience was so horrific that I switched all my devices to another carrier. Every time I would get an assurance from yet another agent that the device was unlocked, I would find out that it wasn't.",0
"AT&T is the WORST company and I suggest you never, ever, ever use them! Someone very special to me bought me my phone from an AT&T store as a gift, but when he got the phone he put it in his name not knowing the nightmare it wouldbe to get it out of his name to put in my name. We spoke to AT&t forover 3 Hours trying to get thetransfer pin and to  put the phonein my name and even after several phone calls with both of us on thephone with AT&t's customerservice the phone was NEVER putin my name! It made it almostimpossible for me to get anothermobile wireless company becauseAT&t is so expensive! They werecharging me almost twice whatany other company out therewould charge me for one phoneone line! Finally, after a year I wasable to go with another companyPaying less than half of what AT&T was charging me! Do not ever use AT&t they are a rip-off in my honest opinion!",0
"Att was never our first choice for internet. We thought it would be better than spectrum, and our apartment complex only offered the two choices.The equipment sent to us, was meant as a self set up. It did not work. Not when I did it myself, or when I had tech support on the phone. First available appointment  for a technician was a week after I got it.Fine.Tell me why the appointment I set durring the time window I was able to be present, was canceled?I was not contacted, I was not told why.One day, I was using text confirmation, the next I was told they missed my appointment and I needed to reschedule. The next available appointment was 3ish weeks out.Set into the next month, after they'd have billed me for the first month of internet I never had a chance to use.I canceled Att and started with spectrum, had it set up less than 24 hours later.It doesn't end there. Because even though I've canceled Att, never got to use the service, and have returned all equipment in a timely manner; Att still auto payed what would have been the monthly fee from my account.The customer service representatives are very nice.The service is not very good.Their infrastructure for matanaince in my area is not very good. And I'd say their customer service on matanaince is also not very good, since I was never even given a courtesy call when the appointment was canceled.And, their systems are garbage, if my service was canceled and I was still somehow charged a phantom bill after being told they would not charge me.Do better Att :/",0
"Spent 6.5 hours today with ATT customer service and @ four - five different representatives and an alleged manager. They are the absolute worst I’ve ever experienced when it comes to service, being helpful, outright lying, nor honoring what they are offering on their web. It started with a simple question on AARP discounts ATT offers, and the amount of ineptitude, misinformation, spin, not knowing the information on most anything, bait/switch, upselling, differing information, changing conditions/pricing at nearly every turn was reprehensible. Then their practice of blaming the customer on not understanding after all their bait/switches, misinformation, and oops…sorry we now can’t offer that…, etc. I’ll be looking for other carriers. Truly terrible and taking advantage of customers.",0
At&t is a untrustworthy. They will steal your data then lie and tell you that you have used it up. At&t are true thefts and crooks and I stand on that.To Who It May Concern I'm down for suing AT&T that's my email,0
"AT&T is a joke, they costumer service is useless, I cannot sign into my account and, they are asking for security questions, I have never seen before. so, I cannot get into my email. call after call and they told me it could take up to 30 days to get it fixed.  well time is up. still trying to get help, I need information that is in my email, I contact my cancer Dr with my email, also I have a lawyer I need to get information from my email to contact but they act like they do not care. I don't know what to do. as big as AT&T is you would think they could take care of a little email problem. I spoke today (9/16/24) to a guy and said they could not help me.",0
"I hate AT&T they are a rip off,,,,There is to much compitition out therewe can switch to anyone better, want to charge me 55,00n to return a phone what a rip off,  just turn me into collections  i dont care tried to charge me 35$ connections fee",0
Had to call customer service multiple times on a Sunday night. Sunday night CS calls are evidently sent over seas. I could hear EVERYTHING  going on in the background. Sounded like they were watching a soccer game or celebrating a birthday. On the 3rd call I found someone  that could help me. I had to resort to calling because the chat is a bot and completely useless. I just got a new iPhone. Probably should've given Verizon a try this time although I doubt that would be much different. I'll wait until Monday for support to avoid the offshore call center,0
"Okay, going to take a moment to vent and to save anyone else the grief.  First of all I have ATT as my wireless provider and my internet provider.  Well, a couple months ago we were having issues with our phones and we took them to the ATT Store in Valpo.  They were awesome.  They fixed her phone and found us some ""savings"" on our account.  I haven't really seen much of that but that's not the point.  They also convinced us to with to switch to their internet air by offering a considerable discount.  While I wasn't thrilled to switch to internet by air for my home internet, they had a trial period and the discount was substantial enough to make me try it.  Well, the end of the trial came and the service was, in a word, eh, but just as good as what I had so with the promised discount, I determined worth it.  Well, one month went by and the discounted rate was not applied.  Two months, three months, still nothing.  Finally I called to ask where the discounted rate was.  After about 20 minutes, the apologized and stated that the discount did not apply since we were already an ATT internet customer.  I explained and asked why did they think I would switch if the discount didn't apply since I had their service already?  After about 20 minutes I was promised that they would honor the agreement made in store and apply the discount retroactive......Problem solved, right?  Nope.  Two months later still no discount.  I call again.  Same story, no discount since I was a current customer.  Again, I asked why would I have switched then if I wasn't promised a discount.  Surprisingly they had no answer.  This time however, after waiting 30 minutes on hold, I was told that I need to go back to the store and talk to them but they will not be giving me a discount on that service. So basically ATT lied to me twice.  I informed them that I will not be returning to the store.  I will be taking my overpriced wireless accounts and my home internet to another provider so the only contact they will get from me is how to return this egg.  So, the moral of the story.  If you have ATT, be aware they do not care about their customers and if you don't, LOOK ELSEWHERE.  Their service isn't that great and their company is a bunch of liars that will say anything to get you off the phone.  Oh, and I have been on a waiting list for well over a year for Fiber interned and still no closer.  Good thing at this point.",0
"The biggest thieves in this country are ATT and they justify everything, the service is not so good, they are professional thieves",0
"I Hate ATTIt has taken more than two hours to get thru to customer service on multiple occasions.An ATT employee sold my password that led to locking down our bank account for a week while someone tried to hack our bank account. No compensation from ATT.Recently waited more than two days for service people to show up. Untrained and didn’t have command of the English language.  Rude. Had to wait for another person to show up.Went without Astros games for more than three months last year (the only reason we continue to have direct tv), no compensation and Now AGAIN!  $30 credit this month and have to call back next month if direct tv still fails to provide what we are paying for!  Are you kidding me?Last spring att laid new line in my neighborhood. Workers who also didn’t speak English buried blooming bluebonnets when the dirt could have been easily thrown on the other side of the hole and spared the flowers!Supervisor claimed a note was left on our door that the work was scheduled. Never happened.We were home when they started the work. They never showed enough respect for the people who planted those flowers or the taxes we pay for this property!  They could knocked on our damn door!Att has a Lot to Learn about CUSTOMER SERVICE.",0
"Was swindled and conned to make a payment that w would restore service for Internet. After making payment, they cut service 10 days into the cycle without notice or warning and demanded the remaining balance was paid. Then spoke to an idiot named Josh, who really thought he was 11' tall over the phone, who was rude, hostile, confrontational, and unprofessional. Then refused to transfer me to his supervisor to discuss the issue since he was no help whatsoever, then disconnecting the call after waiting on the line falsely attempting to get his supervisor right before the call center closed. Had that service over 10 years, and that imbecile managed in a matter of minutes to kill all interest in retaining them as a provider. There's no way Josh should be employed by ATT, and knowing they're paying him to act that way has made me consider giving other providers a chance to gain business, especially since there's a need to update account information due to life events. They are crooks and I recommend you never ever use them for anything other than nothing.",0
"I would give them a negative, if I could. Bottom line 20+ yrs as a customer finally moved to T-mobile about a year ago. I cut my bill literally in half. Best decision ever. But AT&T  is not done with me. I tried to turn on one of my old phones. They are trying to get $500 for a watch line which they say has to be turned off separately. The charged me 75 a month for close to 6 mo and included late fees. What a ripoff? Run away, far away from this corrupt company. Never received so much as a notice regarding this.",0
It’s actually way easier to get an abortion than to quit an ATT product.  They give you the run around like I’ve never witnessed.,0

"Horrible communication and late!!! 12 to 2 means just that, I had to call at 3 to make sure they were even still coming.",0
I haaaate At&t! The greediest most money hungry cell phone company ever! The employee info is all over the place. I paid a $25 home internet bill a day late and was charged $35 which is ridiculous. I'll be finding a new service provider cuz I truly dislike At&t,0

"As every year, AT&T's chaos on the day Apple opens preorders for the new iPhone was unbelievable, and this year was the worst of all. After dealing with the constant issues on their website and thinking I had finally placed my order, it was canceled. I tried a few more times, and each attempt ended the same way. I finally spoke with a customer service agent, but after two hours of conversation, even he couldn’t figure out what the problem was.It’s frustrating and disappointing. After 14 years with AT&T, I’ve decided to look for another provider. The service quality has dropped too much, and it’s clear they don’t care about their customers or providing decent service.",0

SERIOUSLY",0
"AT&T could not be more predatory.When they want your business, you'll see them every single day. But when you are trying to leave their service, it will be near impossible to reach anyone. I have wasted so many hours of my life going back & forth with them, only to be given false transfer PINs and false account numbers. Additionally, they've had so many data breaches that I really don't trust them with my info.For nearly $100/month, you'd think I could at least receive good customer service. But all I've gotten is lies. Don't get sucked into their trap.",0
"March 2024 I corresponded with an AT&T representative regarding pricing.  His exact words were the price will not go up for the following year.  The first month of the second year it goes up $6.September 12th, 2024 at 0235 am my internet goes offline.  Three separate calls to AT&T, my service is down along with 45 other residents.  One employee went as far to say AT&T techs are striking, management is clueless as to fix the issue therefore be prepared for a long term no-service.So literally a multimillion dollar company with upper management ran by morons with no concern for its customers.  I had to cancel two internet business calls and all I could get was a sorry but we can refund you $4.Unfortunately residing in Pensacola, Florida you are limited to finding quality internet companies and unfortunately stuck with low grade companies like AT&T with a 1.3 rating out of 5 being the best on BBB.  I spoke with a neighboring resident who has Starlink.  He said you pay more but it is quality internet.  That’s the route I’m taking.  Two of the three contracted employees from AT&T said they are not from the United States but live overseas.  So AT&T doesn’t even employ US residents but pays foreigners instead.This company is total crap!Rod WeberPensacola, Florida",0

"Called to get internet service 1 month ago they failed to tell me that all employees are on strike and instead lead me to believe they would set up service 1 week from call date , that day came and went with no calls and no one showed up so i called and was advised then that they did not have any techs available and set us up for another apointment , 3 weeks later i get a text message on 9-11-2024 at 4 pm that they can not provide us with the service and they would call in another 7 days to rech service . DONT FNG  BOTHER . your service sucks if you can not even give customers a call and not the day before at 4pm that now you  can not provide service due to your employees not wanting to work you will never again get me to get service from you this is the worst experience i ever got from any company in 43 years , on top of all this i called to ask for a supervisor been on hold now 45 minutes im DONE .",0
"AT&T used to be a good reliable company to deal with. Things have changed; they no longer honor their contracts at this time. We've had problems with our phone and were told a tech would check the line at 8:00 am this morning. No one ever arrived or contacted anyone. Called AT&T and was promised a tech would arrive by noon. No one ever arrived or contacted us. Called AT&T again; this time they said a tech would be here between 1:30 and 4:00 pm - never showed up or contacted anyone. AT&T is supposedly open between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm but it's clear no one is coming, especially since customer service reps have been instructed not to provide names of techs assigned to a job or provide any info on their supervisors. This is about avoiding accountability, and it's also taking jobs away from people who are actually willing and able to work, Filed with the FCC and about to file with the PUC, will probably leave a complaint on BBB's website so everyone can be made aware AT&T has become completely unreliable.",0
After 9 years I finally had to find something better. Between the constant nag for new equipment and services and pop up odd fees and the constant push for autopay and most of all the price for what you get in return is not worth it. The ONLY good thing is I Never had signal problems anyplace in the world which is why I stayed with them for so long but that's where the good part stops. Being switched to autopay when I specifically told them not to was a complete violation of trust. They have cost me time and money in bank overdrafts and other issues and the best they have is 3GB of data which is garbage by today's standards. Their home internet speeds are terrible and they have bandwidth caps and are one of the only companies that still has them. They are just not up with the state of technology and the prices are terrible. It was time for us to part ways,0

"I ordered AT&T Internet Air for business with static IPs, but the device they sent lacked the static IP information I needed. The saleswoman who sold me the service was unhelpful after making the sale, directing me to call the 800 customer support number instead. After making more than 20 calls, I finally found someone who could assist, but they told me to return the device and suggested I call back to cancel the service. After returning the device, I made another 5 more calls before finally reaching the right person to cancel the account. From the time I ordered the service to the time it was canceled, I spent two months, made over 20 calls, wasted more than 10 hours on the phone, and made several trips to AT&T stores. Throughout this ordeal, I was repeatedly transferred to the wrong departments and even hung up on multiple times.AT&T's customer support is chaotic and frustrating. Their representatives are often rude, and the system is disorganized. There are separate departments for residential and business accounts, each offering different services—like phone, TV, fiber internet, U-verse internet, and Internet Air. Each department has its own customer service team, and they can't handle issues outside their specific area. Additionally, AT&T does not provide a clear phone number for specific problems. The general customer service number, 800-331-0500, often leads to dead ends, depending on the representative's knowledge.",0
"Sold at Costco, was told by ATT Retail that the Costco ""contractors"" were a scam, increased plan cost, botched transfer from Xfinity in the retail store (assigned phone number to an apple watch), other botched transfer issues, cancelled service after 4 days (""buyer's remorse"") and in took 25 hours of phone calls (plus one hour waiting for a store manager to leave and go to lunch only to have him tell me to call ""Customer Retention"") over five months to stop getting billed for services. I was supposed to get almost $800 in credits but only got $540 (approximately) of them processed. Multiple promises that they would provide credits and correspondence.  I think my experience with them is over, after the put me in collections for $38.77 because I told my credit card company to stop paying their bills (after not having their services for several months).  They charge the $38.77 for my autopay being rejected!  I finally paid the $38.77 because it was less ""costly"" than spending another two hours on hold and with ATT Biling rep tell me that his manager had to call me back withing 48 hours!",0

"It's hard to imagine how an American company could offer worse service or make dealing with them more difficult. When the TV box for the main TV went out, it took well over an hour to reach a person on the phone. They sent a reprocessed replacement box; it arrived quickly and worked well for 3 days and then quit. Another 34 minutes on the phone, this time while I drove, and then they said they can't replace the box they sent a few days ago until I read them the number on the bottom of the box. I explained I didn't have the number with me, and it would mean I'd have to call back tomorrow, spending another 30-60 minutes on the phone and delaying TV service another day; I asked if they don't have the number since they just sent the box. They had no interest in helping. They value their time by keeping you forever on hold, but they have no respect for yours. Can't get away from them fast enough!",0
"I am incredibly disappointed with the abysmal customer service from AT&T Fiber. After being a loyal customer with an account in good standing for years, I encountered a situation where my credit card had to be replaced due to fraudulent activity. This caused a slight delay in payment—completely out of my control. Despite explaining the situation to their customer service, I was hit with a one-time late fee.You would think that after years of reliable payments, AT&T would show some flexibility or basic human understanding. But instead, their customer service was rude, dismissive, and completely unwilling to help. They refused to reverse the fee, even though I explained that the delay was due to a situation involving fraud, something I had no control over.Rather than appreciate a long-time customer or even show empathy for an obvious and honest mistake, AT&T treated me like just another number. The customer service reps were condescending, cold, and seemed more interested in enforcing rigid policies than providing any actual service. This level of treatment is shocking, especially from a company that claims to care about its customers.If AT&T Fiber is willing to treat loyal, long-standing customers this poorly, I can only imagine the experience for everyone else. They clearly value squeezing a few extra dollars over treating people fairly or maintaining customer relationships. Stay far away if you expect any decency or customer care.",0

"AT&T is the worst phone company I've ever dealt with. I bought a new phone in May but was given a refurbished or used because it came with no plastic on it and it didn't even have a box when the guy walked out he had to go in the back and get a box. The phone was defective, I went to the AT&T the day after I bought the phone, the guy did nothing so I called at&t. After 3 months of resetting the phone a new sim then a wireless sim, they finally filed the warranty claim to send me another phone. I pay insurance every month. They sent me a phone with no box, no stylist, and the phone was in no way protected. They sent it in a thin piece of plastic with paper around it, in a box that was seven times the size of the phone. So the post office does not handle things with care which means the phone was bounced around the whole trip until it got to me. Now the chances of this phone having something wrong with it is very high. I called AT&T and three different supervisors told me that it was a refurbished phone that it's in the warranty and I signed the contract the green to that. But yes from day one they charge me for a brand new phone. Now I talked to another supervisor named Brooke today and she told me no it's not refurbished it was never used. So AT&T continues to lie, each agent I spoke to, most of them supervisors, each say something different. AT&T is sneaky, deceiving, and complete Liars. Brooke the supervisor talk to me terribly insulted me and then told me that I was being hostile. Because she decided to keep talking over me. When I first started talking she must have muted me or was doing something else because it took her 31 seconds to respond to me when I stopped talking. That's not normal. When I got the phone in the store the man was well aware that I was videoing the interaction because of previous issues with AT&T. Now that I have proof that AT&T store gave me a used phone with no box, and AT&T deciding to send me a refurbished phone, I'll be pursuing other actions. If you want to deal with Liars, and sneaky people, go ahead and get service through at&t. Otherwise I would go to Verizon.",0
"I broke my old phone and needed a new one before moving abroad to Spain for a year. AT&T told me and it was IMPOSSIBLE to buy a phone ANYWHERE with the carrier unlocked. A flat out LIE, you can buy one at the apple store easily. Now, not only will they refuse to unlock my new phone for me so I can get a Spanish phone number, they have avoided my calls, AND lied to me several times saying that they did unlock it when they actually didn’t. Additionally, I have continually received people on the phone that have no idea what they are talking about and it is clear that in many cases, I know more about this issue than them. Not only is the international plan that I am currently relying on costing me $10/day, but my safety is at risk here due to a lack of ability to communicate with the directors of my study abroad program and my host family.",0
"AT&T service is the worst internet provider on the planet. My internet cable was cut Sept 6 at 9 AM. The earliest appointment was Sept 9 between 8 - 12 so I confirmed it. They did not show! I received text updates saying they are running late but never showed. I called twice for a status and was put on hold for 43 minutes the first time and 64 minutes the second time. They finally told me that due to the AT&T strike they did not assign my ticket to a technician and there was none available. But At 7 PM an AT&T technician arrived at the house directly across the street for a repair but he refused to fix my cable because my work ticket was not assigned to him and the customer service rep cannot assign a work ticket. There is a huge disconnect between the customer service department, the dispatcher and the technician. They are very inefficient and I the customer got screwed.Thank you AT&T… Your FIRED!",0

They are expensive and when I bring a concern up to them on the TV and I want to cancel service they say oh we can not do anything youll have to pay 380 to cancel tv. They do not care if the customer is not happy they will make you pay anyway. They don't care about there customers. I do not recommend att for any services. I will be switching my TV, internet, and phone to someplace else.",0

I spoke with a worker who took pictures of my yard but to date I have not heard from anyone. I know about imminent domain. I guess this is one of those cases where we get screwed because of large corporate interests.",0
I'm tired of them charging my card that is no longer on the account I removed that card for a reason it's happened to me and my mom over drawing our accounts then we're having to be charged with an over draw fee we've called so many times to tell them stop charging the card so they obviously keep card information so I will never use at&t ever again (not to mention the service sucked),0
Ordered a phone case from them. Came defective. Couldn’t return at any local store locations (due to not being corporate locations). The returns customer service line (stated on the invoice receipt) wouldn’t do anything and told me to go to the store. Wasted my time and money. Had to do a charge back.,0
ATT’s coverage and service are horrible! Don’t listen to their reps. They will tell you that you have strong coverage just to get the sale.,0
"One of their 3rd party contractors in Cypress took the liberty to leave my signed "" beware of dog"" gate open. My Sevice animal is dead now. He was my best friend and care taker for 13 years. And he was still a very healthy boy. People , they don't care about you,  your property,  your pets, your service animals etc and they should have to pay. PERIOD!

Went from prepaid to postpaid and can't pay my bill thru Myatt cuz it is in my prepaid number. Have spent over 30 days trying to resolve the issues and no help. I am now responsible for a $600 phone that I can't get any info on because of my prepaid account. No wonder At&t now has a class action lawsuit against them which I will be joining,0
"If I could give a zero I would. Being on the phone for 28 minutes, the guy had no clue how to revamp an iPhone and then hung up on me.  Needed better service and he sat there masterbating.",0
Whatever you do never switch over from your carrier! I recently switched over the biggest mistake of my life and I get constant call drops and no service. If you’re traveling overseas FORGET ABOUT HAVING SERVICE WITH THEIR 10/day plan! It is a scam they want to switch you over and then hold you accountable for 3 years of responsibility with phone! (I brought over iPhone 15s and the credit is applied in the span of 3 years to my bill),0
"I have used att for a few years now, and recently had a problem on my iPhone 13.I contacted them and said they would send someone out immediately, as it was under warranty.Now two months later, I am being charged $250.00 for their service.  A fee was never mentioned, until I received this invoice notification.I have nothing good to say about ATT, and  their warranty or service. I will be dropping them, as soon as possible.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER USE ATT FOR YOUR SERVICE.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY REGRET IT.Terry",0
"AT&T has been my provider for internet, Uverse TV & mobile phone service…the internet 5G fails daily & does not work so WiFi is not operational…customer service is very hard to reach…have been struggling to reach customer service for more than 5 weeks for this recurring problem…will look to another vendor as going without WiFi on a daily basis is an expensive waste of funds without working products as described in my agreement.  :(",0
"Att technicians are some of the laziest people on the planet. Never get att if you want real customer service. I speak for an entire neighborhood out in travelers rest sc, we’ve been without wifi for a month and they refuse to come out and fix the lines",0
"I’ve never left a review in my life but after being on the phone with AT&T for 70ish hours In 2 months over the same issue THAT ATT CAUSED I feel like I need to leave a review for the rest of the world to know!ATT has blacklisted my son’s phone bc of their screw up and my son has been without a phone for two months and no one seems to have enough sense to fix it. I have been with ATT for 25 plus years and have 8 lines, home internet, 4 I pads, 2 watches and my whole business is on ATT and I still can’t get anything done. I’m currently on the phone with att on hold and have been for two hours which is why I have plenty of time to write this review. If anyone is looking into getting anything ATT please do yourself a favor and reconsider. I’m to the point I would rather send smoke signals then give this dump another penny of my money!Scott WUpdate: so after two insurance claims (250.00 each) i finally had to buy a new 1500.00 dollar phone and had to get my son a new number the problem is “fixed”! 2,000.00 dollars later my sons phone works bc they couldn’t fix what they screwed up.",0
Worst co.to be on I been a customer for 16 days n I'm out wy because I go online for a minute n suddenly stops it won't starts back costumer service will not do anything about it so the hell with it back  to  t mobil,0
I was with ATT for many years both my business account and personal account.  I recently switched companies due to a better packaged deal.  I transferred the business account and cancelled the personal.  After paying off phones and paying the final bill I have been unable to get my IPhones unlocked.   They send me to website which sends me to customer care which sends me back to the website.  This has been going on for months.  I ask to speak to a supervisor and was told no one can help me.  They are holding my phones hostage for no reason.,0
"I moved away from ATT about 10 years ago, for some reason - my wife stayed with them for 18+ years.And all that loyalty got us what?Misled promises. Period.We were strolling down grocery store and ATT guy lured us into Fiber Optic Internet connection which is supposed to be 'WOW'.I never bought the hype but they promised its cheaper than what we were paying and since my wife has been wireless user - we get additional $20 discount + $300 gift card.What happens next:Gift card never arrived - so I called - and they are like - oh but you did not confirm that you wanted gift card. W.T.F.  Anyway - after 50 mins calls - they release the gift card.And when I asked about $20 credit for using wireless plan at the same address (which was the condition) - they said - it takes few months and the excess we paid will be refunded and the discounted rates will apply.I check in every 3 months  or so and after a total of 9 months - they tell me - kid you not - I have chat transcripts, that plan is no longer available.W.T.F.ATT signs up customers who want to save money luring them into false promises and then after they are stuck with ATT - they tell you ""that plan is no longer available"".I am not surprised by this behavior because this was the reason I moved out of ATT network.  But due to changes in employment and to save few bucks - I 'believed' them again to be misled yet again.ATT wireless service in our area is patchy too...I have had ZERO drop calls in years in this area but with ATT service - that's no problem - we have miles of 'patchy service'.ATT continues its legacy...at least they are consistent in screwing people of their hard earned money.Time to look for another service I guess.",0
"Horrendous experience with Fleet Complete. They lied about contract structure, saying no prepayment penalty if I paid for the device but then still included prepayment in contract if I ended it prior to 3 years. But 1 year in, devices stopped working. Very cheaply made. I tried cancelling, but they made me file a support ticket first. Support could not diagnose the issue, so I tried cancelling again. But I could not cancel with an open support ticket for some reason (likely just to prevent cancellations). Any time I call, I get transferred to different departments until I am eventually disconnected. I have spent hours and hours with support trying to cancel these devices because I hate still giving them money. We have work ipads on this account or else I would cancel the credit card. To this day, I have devices that I cannot cancel even though they haven't worked for years. Absolute thievery.",0
"Honestly, I completely regret switching from T-mobile to AT&T. I made the mistake of switching my whole family from T-mobile to AT&T after being approached by an employee in a Target by my house. He promised things would be cheaper, we could all upgrade our phones, etc- I fell into wanting the newest iPhone I guess. So we all switched over in July of 2023 and let me tell you- don't freaking to do it. We have had more issues with our phone service through ATT this year than we EVER had with T-mobile, and we were with T-mobile for over 10 years. From calls just straight up not going through for NO reason, terrible coverage compared to T-mobile, the constant outages and privacy breaches UGH. I'm so mad at myself for switching over. I can't tell you how many times I've not been able to do the simplest things like pulling up directions or something just to not be able to do it because of an outage or poor service. NEVER happened with T-mobile. Also got talked into adding another line and getting another iPhone, bringing my husband onto our plan- ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE! I was straight up LIED TO by the representative regarding the price increase on our bill- and when I called customer service to complain and see what we could do- the woman I spoke with literally said ""I don't know what you want me to do"" and ""so what are you going to do?"" MA'AM you are in customer service, fix the freaking problem!! It's not MY job to solve these issues. It's yours?! Anyway. Worst company and service ever. If you're thinking about switching over don't do it. Oh also we had internet service through them and we moved, they don't service our area so I cancelled, and then was called by them to ask why I cancelled and how they could get me back (LOL)- I told them they don't service the place where I'm moving and they double checked (waste of my time) only to tell me oh yeah no we don't. Then kept freaking calling me and emailing me like WE MISS YOU PLEASE COME BACK TO YOUR INTERNET PLAN. Like come on, communicate w each other and leave me the heck alone. Funny how they don't want to help when you have issues but when they want to sell you something you can't get rid of them. Anyway- I guess this has been built up for some time but again came up today as I tried to return my mom's phone call only for it not to go through THREE TIMES. No voicemail or anything. Just a message saying that this number can't take calls right now. HELLO? But she got my texts just fine. WILD. You are the worst ATT :) ALSO sorry last thing! I would cancel and leave them in the dust but absolutely don't want to put my family through switching plans and phones and everything again. It was such an annoying process that I regret putting them through once, I don't want to do that to them again! k bye",0
Been in the Unlimited & More Plan for years 2018. Over the past three year AT&T  has increased my bill $15-20 each year since they no longer offer that plan. They keep trying to get me to switch off this grandfathered plan so I will lose my HBO MAX for life plan. Every time I call in for the increased rate I’m told the same thing. It seems they’re trying to bully me off the old plan by increasing the rates each year. How is this right. The customer service representatives are rude and usually hang up and are no help.,0
"They are the worst company I really want to suit them please someone let me know how can I do it , is too much , how come the government let this company still money from customers like this .",0
"Each month, they have an extra charge for something that makes no sense.If you complain, they will say it is in policy, which means they created a fake policy to make the charge valid!!Very unpolite customer service.I lost my cases to my online account. It has been over two months, and they still say it is a technical issue we are working on.If you call overseas from WhatsApp, they still charge you.The rate is 0.terrible company.",0
"Ive had to make so many more calls, im just talking about 1 specific day here, but i made 3 calls and had to just hang uo was so frustrating. And on the 4th call the lady was finally willing to help me about my POOR service and she ended up sending me something and after that my service was good. I asked if it would stay like that she said yes of course. But then the next month, i told them prior i needed to change day i can pay to my pay day, and so after these calls and fixing my service i got charged on the 3rd or 4th so i called about it and asked why so early we agreed on the 14th she said oh that starts next month. So considering i paid that month i thought ""ok i paid this month and the day i pay changes next month"" but no i guess i had to pay for something they probably made up and the same month on the 14th it tried charging me again. At that point i obviously didnt save enough thinking i paid that month. Now after missing that payment my service is even worse then it was at the start. They have great service, but not willing to share it",0
Att &t is either the worst company or has literally never re invested the billions they make back into technology.  Either way the service is terrible and you can never get a hold of anyone unless your service plan is up then they never stop bothering you. Wish I had an option but apparently they have paid people off in my area as it is the only option for cable services.,0
"This was a while ago. ATT bought out by Indian scammers.I have ATT prepaid. Their regular service had a deal on 3 lines for my family. I told my mom and she bought it, and she mentioned they asked for her SSN, which she thought was weird. I had a bad feeling.Not two months later she got a credit alert, someone opened up a credit card in FL. No one in the family has ever been! Thank god she shut that down.I walked in store and talked to a manager, he said call up their phone reps, regular ATT has different reps from ATT Prepaid. OMG all from India! And I pretended to buy a line from them and they also asked my SSN!Classic America, bought out by Indian scammers. I can't believe it, but it makes sense these days. NEVER GIVE YOUR SSN!!! Why would a phone company need that??",0
Service is trash and the representatives are useless will never use them again,0
"I have been with ATT for quite a while. I would say that their customer service has gotten so bad that not only you have to wait for more than 30 minutes to get a live agent, but also get ridiculously overcharged. I am HATING AT&T post paid service. Before switching over to post paid, I had prepaid and life was so much easier- No surprise charges, no headaches. Whenever I call AT&T about extra charges, the answer I get is that my next bill is going to be lower. But, when I see my next bill, it is higher.😬 Their agents are LIERS. If you want to get a heart attack, signup for AT&T’s post-paid service.",0
Horrible  service and customer support !!!,0
"Big mistake on my part switching from T-Mobile to ATT. Since then, in order to connect my phones properly I must have spent 20 to 30 actual hours on the phone with various assistants from all over the world, in which ""most"" of them are very hard to understand, and seem to pull out an answer from a cheat sheet in front of them. 10 months later I'm still having issues.I now just called because I received a special offer for current customers that have Fiber optic Internet service, and they are telling me that the special offer does not apply to me. But when I read the offer thru the email they have sent me it clearly said for current customers upgrading to 1 Gig. with no other services needed.Apparently I don't know how to read! What has become to our wonderful old Country. Going downhill fast. I can't for the services to end so I can ditch ATT for good.",0
This is the worst service I've ever had my bill is so high they take money out of my account w/o me authorizing the payment then turn my service off and tell me I need 175$ more y'all can count y'all days I will be leaving at&t and leaving bad reviews every day.,0
"Absolute worst customer service ever. I have spent hours on the phone with them, I have been transferred to multiple Indians, Pakistanis, and god knows what other nationalities to no avail. I am done dealing with those cretins and I will take my business somewhere else. I have been with them for over 10 years. I guess they really do not care for their customers. They convinced me to change my old service with the new Internet Air. Well, it does not work. They also refuse to send tech to install it because they say it is child play. Now they will not take back their new machine that does not work, while disconnecting my old one that was working just fine. I am left with no internet, and zero help from ATT. But I bet they will keep sending me bills. Oh well, Spectrum Internet, here I come. You just gained a new customer by default.",0
The absolute worst customer service and telecommunications Co. EVER. Too long for me to write here.,0
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER and BILL INCREASED DRASTICALLY with no explanation. I called Customer Service to sit on hold for 17 minutes and then ""try"" and speak with the person who could barely speak English.  I was trying to resolve an issue from the previous month when I called and was told it was ""all fixed now.""  SURPRISE, still messed up.  All these representatives do is keep saying ""please hold,"" ""I am sorry about your experience but rest assured I will assist you,""  and when you tell them that the information you were provided the last time you called and they are now saying ""I am sorry that is  wrong but I will assist you,"" and you get completely different information.  I have been with AT&T for over 10 years and the past couple of years their customer service is AWFUL!!!!!   Can't speak English clearly to understand, have NO IDEA what they are saying and information they are providing, and everyone tells you something different!!  My elderly parents and my aunt are also with AT&T and unfortunately I have tried to assist both of them the past few weeks and also had horrible experiences (not to mention the phone calls both lasted over an hour and a half)!    I have already switched to Verizon (as of yesterday) and I will be assisting my parents and aunt leave AT&T this weekend.  Hard to believe that about 5 years ago I actually wrote another review for AT&T giving them 5 stars and talking about how they were one of the ""few companies left who still truly believed in good customer service; and although the outcome of my conversation wasn't exactly what I hoped for, the customer service representative was polite, knowledgeable, and took the time to explain everything to me.""  What happened AT&T?????",0
Not signal at all even in open parking lot.,0
The worst worst service that I've ever had that I don't have they can't get it right they keep milling me for something that already straightened out when I finally got to talk to American English they sent me another one the lady I talk to you says they don't keep history of the last calls which I know they do I don't owe them anything I haven't had AT&t in 3 months,0
Terrible customer support. I just wanted to see our bills from more than 16 months ago but they refused. The representative said if I wanted to see them they would charge me $5 per month for each bill and then hung up on me. The service gets worse and worse and the bills go up and up. Our family is switching to Verizon.,0
"I hate ATT with a passion at this point 2.5 hrs of run around for arbitrary account access... kudos, I now am willing to buy out and switch carriers... hope your stock plummets when MIT realizes that this is the network of morons...",0
This is YET AGAIN another company that CONSTANTLY attempts to try to overcharge you & come up with CONSTANT crap micro-charges... with a 1.3 rating... they are DAMN LUCKY to be getting any money at all!,0
Dipshit morons...  kept me on hold for over an hour... patience has worn very thin... switching to new carrier bs...,0
The worst experience I ever had !!!! Been on the phone 2 freaking hours just to get my internet situated !! Do not recommend,0
I made an internet with them recently and it's been a month sense that and no one came to install it and they never responded back and they blocked my phone number so I'm going to leave your scam asses out I always hated them I was just stupid enough to get back with you guys,0
"How bad can customer service be before you have to believe they are doing this on purpose? ATT's customer service is so bad that it is not just my desire to never use their product again but I also want to get 10 other people not to use their product. This is the same way I felt about Sears and Kmart before they took their plunge to nothing. I have spent 25 days now trying to get 10 phones ""unlocked"", I got 8 done but the last two have been held for any reason they can think of! It has taken so long that one of the reasons is that we nit another billing cycle and the two phones that have not been released now have a higher monthly service fee and they still won't release. I shut the service off so that they did not get rewarded for delaying, but that has not helped. ATT sucks.",0
"After about 2 hours on the phone trying to verify the account that we have had for 30 years, I spent another half hour being told that after we got a new fiber optic line ATT will not come and get rid of the old copper lines running from the pole to the house. They said that we would have to hire an outside contractor to do that sort of thing.",0
"HORRIBLE. Yeah they CAN have great service, only if they let you. Which isnt all that likely",0
we called in on the 27th and was informed we needed to call the loyality dept to make payment arrangments she gave us the number . called it right away and kept getting a message saying that number doesnt work in our area code. so the 28th i called again and spent another 1 1/2 hours on the phone with this guy and we made the payments arrangements for the 18th of september and 30 days later for the balance. he said the payment was approved and i didnt need to do anything else. we are good to go. i woke up this morning 9/4/24 and seen our cameras were offline and i looked at our equipment that uses hotspots and seen they were also all offline so i called my wifes phone and message comes up that we are suspended. after 30 minutes i get to the loyality dept and she says that the guy never finialized the payment arrangement that we put in place and was told it was approved and we no longer qualify to do payments. it is a holiday week we are already money short and now we dont have enough money to pay payroll i told her. she said nothing she can do and i started in on my rantt and the line went silent. they put us on hold and hung up on us.  we made the arrangments and they didnt follow thru with them and now we have to pay the price. wont beable to pay payroll this week. thanks at&t you are the best. we are going to see if we can get all of our lines opened up and see about swithcing to another company,0
"AT&T definitely has a customer service issue.  I notified AT&T before I moved out of my apartment to have service cancelled.  They told me at the time that I had to turn in the modem.  I told them at that time, and several times after that, that I didn't have a modem. I told them there was a big built in box with a door in my closet and that the modem must be built in.  I had always lived in a house and knew where my modem was located. I talked to them several times before I moved about the modem, and no one ever told me that the modem was in the box.  I found out from apartment management that there was indeed a modem in the box, but this was after I moved 6 hours away.  I explained the situation to AT&T and asked if someone could pick it up, and they said no.  People are moving in and out of the huge apartment complex all the time and most use AT&T, so someone could have picked the modem up.  Now three months later, they say I owe $150, didn't offer me a way to pay in installments, and turned it over to collections.  One of those times I spoke to them before I moved 6 hrs. away, someone should have told me where the modem was located.  They just don't care!",0
"Overall bill has gone up $40 in the last year with no discernible change in service. Called “customer service” to ask why and was on the phone for 40 minutes with a rep who was clueless, barely spoke English, and eventually hung up on me. Choose another provider if you can.",0
AT&T uverse TV and AT&T in general is exhibit a of how to rip off customers with poor product quality and zero customer service. This company has been in decline for 20 years. It's demise is imminent.  They are self destructing,0
"Prices are ridiculous for the services and I would never ever recommend anyone to them. I was warned by so many but wanted have my own experience and now I have and I can tell you, it was a horrible mistake. I hate Spectrum but will deal with them before I deal with AT&T again. Customer service is terrible and not knowledgeable of how they can help you. I was hospitalized for a little under a month and I reached out to let them know I was really sick and needed surgery. They told me how much I needed to pay to square up my account and just get it paid when I could and that everything would be fine once I paid the amount which was over $300. I checked my system after getting better and ready to go back home in which I work from home to only find out they turned off all my services because they said I didn’t communicate with them and make arrangements to pay. I cancelled everything to NEVER return. Unfortunately, google fiber isn’t in my area yet so Spectrum won me back and can do a quick turnaround. If you’re on the fence about AT&T for any services, Don’t do it! Take it from me! I’ve give them the benefit of doubt on all services but it ended badly for me and so many others. You have been warned. 😝",0
"After almost 20 years of being a customer, I requested a one time exception to make a payment arrangement and was told “my account doesn’t qualify”. This occurred after being told I’ve never had any returned payments or other issues. No one was willing to assist and chalked it up to a random system selection that determines who can get an exception and who cannot. Additionally, Jose Z., a manager, was rude, unprofessional, misleading and hung up on me when I pointed out discrepancies in what he relayed to me. A company who has had so many issues and instability with protecting customer information should be more concerned and customer friendly. It’s time to change carriers!",0
"Le pongo 1 porque no hay 0.Mas de una hora en hold en el teléfono, oyendo musica y propagandas estupidas, que dicen que pida mas información el agente que no contesta.I give it a 1 because there is no 0.More than an hour on hold on the phone, listening to music and stupid commercials, telling me to ask for more information from the agent who doesn't answer.",0
"They’re the worst . I’ve been a longtime loyal internet customer of AT&T . Plus , I’m a senior . My monthly promo price of $56.00 for  stand alone internet was increased , so I contacted AT&T to see what kind of discount they could offer  me bc they increased my monthly rate to $71.00 month . Joyce gave me a new monthly price of $61.00 month . This was a discount of $10.00 per month as like my previous 12 month price . Well , I get my new bill for Sept & they’re billing me for $71.00 per month ( no discount ) . I just called customer service & spoke to ARAH . She said there is no monthly discount of $10.00 & my monthly cost is the $71.00 & they would not adjust my monthly bill to the $61.00 per month that I was quoted / agreed upon with Joyce . They will not honor the price given to me by their representative that I spoke with on July 24th . Really , AT&T ?!  I just want people to be aware of their horrible customer service practices & that they do not honor their monthly prices given  ! How do they get away with that ? Plus ,they seem to slow speed down at night . This has been an issue with them in the past , too . I would not recommend them . Beware !",0
They are slow and have no idea what they’re doing. They are also expensive,0
I went to make a payment arrangement through the app. The app froze so I closed it and re opened it. When I did it showed zero balance owed. It took the money without an authentication from me. Ended up paying my rent a week late. Soon as my phone contract is up I'm finished with AT&T. I know calling customer service is a waste of time. 15 years with AT&T. They have fallen so far.,0
"I wish there was an option to give zero stars. I've spent the last few business days trying to cancel my service. It won't allow me to do it online. Getting anything accomplished with their customer service is equivalent to trying to win the mega millions. If you can make it through the labyrinth of options, and actually speak to a human, your experience gets even worse. I've been transferred multiple times since apparently nobody wants to do their job. Ive had the calls magically disconnected more times than I can count. I've opted for the call back option which is their way of telling you, ""we aren't ever going to call."" The store told me they can't cancel services, and that I have to call the number. Is it seriously impossible to get rid of this service? This is beyond unacceptable. I was never rude or discourteous to anyone I spoke to. I chose the correct options during the automated section. They had zero reason to disregard me for days at a time. I'm not sure what else to do to get my service removed. I will never use their services again. Mostly because I think it's going to be impossible to get rid of them in the first place. I'll get a new bank card so they can't take anymore of my money. Bet they won't have any problem suspending or cancelling my service then. Bet I won't have any issues getting anyone on the phone telling me I owe them money. That sector of their call service works perfectly. Do I need to get legal services to get this cancelled, or can someone just push a few buttons on a keyboard and get this taken care of?",0
"Run AWAY from AT + T. Seriously. I was with T-Mobile for 10+ years. I adored them. The only reason I even entertained At+T is T Mobile had an ongoing tech issue to upgrade my iPhone for over a year (I left the country and came back and tried again). I STRESSED to AT+T how important my international service was. The rep in FL told me it would function no problem with roaming like Tmobile. WRONG. As soon as I left the country, I started getting notes about $12 DAILY Charges. What? I messaged At + T - they closed the ticket with NO REPLY. I called internationally and STAYED on hold for 45 min with NO answer. I received a bill for DOUBLE + NO credits from what they promised on promotions yet. I have now filed TWO BBB claims to REFUND all and implement again their ATT Passport (I researched and found out they STOPPED the monthly passport in 2024) WHAT? in our global economy? Their presidents office CALLED me (I am in Bali) repeatedly at 3 am (I saw missed calls in morning). They refused to answer my 5 questions via email or leave a professional voice mail DETAILING all on ensuring my phone is optimized. I have no choice when I travel but to keep my phone in Airplane mode unless connected in WIFI. This is worse than 2000. I filed a FTC suit as well. I found out they have multiple ones. As soon as I am back in USA I am running back to TMOBILE.",0
"literally had the worst experience and no help whatsoever from att regarding my phone screen and insurance claim. no one could verify my account and the chat agents kept giving me the same run around with no solution. they ended up telling me to go to a store. how inconvenient knowing that not everyone is mobile enough to pick up and go nor does everyone have the ability to drive themselves. completely insensitive to those with physical disabilities.  All the stores around me as well close at 6pm... yeah real clever timing so the store closes when people are getting off work. I pay over $200 in services a month from att and got no where with my issue and was just told to go to a store. save yourself time, money, and tears and switch to a different service while you still can.",0

Had att service and it was great then I moved. I was canceled on twice to come and have a tech connect my internet. 3 weeks later and no internet and no appointment was rescheduled but there is a bill due on a service that has not been provided.,0
"They lied to me about the value of my trade in, and have been secretly charging me for my current phone which i was told i was gonna owe only about 130$ and now i realise i own almost 900$, this company loves doing this kind of deals stay away from it, and was not enough cause now im having service problems and nobody nows anything",0
"It's impossible to deal with AT&T! After 3 hours of calling, going to website, talking to representatives, I still couldn't pay my monthly bill. Why? Because they suddenly don't recognize my password that I ve been using for years! Also they don't recognize my pin, which I ve been using for years. In order to change my pin they ask for my password and visa versa. It's a vicious cycle. Reps are NOT HELPFUL WHATSOEVER!I have to go to AT&T store, try to solve this problem. If they won't help me, I am switching to another service!",0
"AT&amp;T ARE ONLY IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING MONEY! I’VE BEEN A CUSTOMER SINCE 2017 AND I’VE GIVEN THEM OVER 7,000 DOLLARS ON PHONES AND REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE MY KIDS BREAK THEIR PHONES.

I ASKED IS ANYBODY GOING TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIX IT, BECAUSE I DON’T WANT A USED PHONE FOR MY NEW PHONE.

"I don’t know what has happened in the past 2 years, but it is total nonsense trying to get any type of customer service. IF you can get a real person, one person tells one thing yet another says the total opposite.  I spent 4 days trying to get a HUMAN with no avail until Friday and it was an absolute circus.The only reason I keep the phone plan is the coverage area. Otherwise I’d go right back to TMobile.",0
Definitely not a service you want when trying to get things resolved the customer service is horrible horrible horrible no one listen! You will get passed from one representative to the next I have had them for over 9 years and I’m now in search for a new provider,0
Just spent an hour trying to update my cell phone address on line and couldn’t figure out how to do so so I gave up. Called AT&T only to spend 25 minutes with the rep who finally changing my address. Then spend over an hour trying to have the rep (who had NO clue) explain how I could do this myself and was TOTALLY confused with his explanation so I asked for a supervisor. Was Hung up on thee times by the rep (who called back) while waiting over 45 minutes which felt like a delay tactic. Never spoke with ANY supervisor and never got another call back on the last hang up,0
"Manager at the Longview, Washington store treats the employees poorly with great disrespect.  Also, the iPad I purchased didn’t work, the techs tried to resolve and they charged me a restocking fee because I had to return it.  I would have kept the iPad if it would be operational but is worthless if it won’t work.   They shouldn’t charge you restocking fees on defective merchandise.",0
"AT&T customer service is difficult to reach.  Hold times around an hour.  I left Tracfone because questions could not be addressed. Now I'm paying for 3 phones by contract with AT&T, and STILL do not have access to customer service when their is a malfunction or I have a question.",0
"Did an online purchase with a 40.99 quote for 4 new lines. They canceled order said go to store for id verification. I did so in store the plan was 60.99 but he added auto pay and paperless for another 10 dollars off. But i have to wait 2 to 3 billing cycles when online it was immediate then i kept being told basically, I can't read i am lying and I am just looking for aa discount that the only other discount is military teacher etc. but yet it clearly says this on the quote AT&T Unlimited Premium® PL planSee discounts$40.99OFFER: Get $10.00/mo. in bill credits for up to 36 mos. when you add a new line, bring your own smartphone, and transfer your existing number. Plus, we'll waive your activation fee. NOTE Discount not reflected in cart.",0
"Do not trust anything they text or email you.  It is most likely incorrect. AMEX could not explain what they are up to.  Their website is very poorly designed with broken links, and it is unable to ask appropriate questions to get you to correct person for the reason you are calling about.  In addition to having their system go down several times lately, their web site is awful.  They need an AI to straighten it out.   Very disappointing.",0
"0 stars - If I could I would rank ATT&T 0 stars, but I had to give them a 1 to get to this point.  Our experience has been horrific and began in January, 2024.  Issues are still not resolved and it is August 31, 2024. We set up a plan with ATT and purchased a motorola phone which the store rep recommended to us.  It was one of those new screens you are supposed to be able to bend and it broke with in the 3 day window.  They would not take the phone back.  Instead they sent it to Motorola.  Motorola replaced it with a refurbished phone, but it took 3 weeks!!  The screen stopped working again in late July.  We have been trying to cancel our ATT service since then but keep getting the run-a-round.  It is like they are holding us hostage!  I am trying today to cancel.  Again, run around, waiting for a call back.  Better business bureau here we come!!  Oh agents are rude and don't know much just pass you here and there.  Verizon is awesome and has awesome service, but spendy.  T-Mobile is where we landed - the customer service is outstanding.  Not quite the coverage of Verizon, but good enough for the price.  AT&T is a ripoff and customer service is horrid!",0
Called for info.Agent wanted personal info before answering question.Not happening.,0
If I could give them zero stars I would. I reluctantly switched over to AT&T for a “cheaper” bill. I ended up with 3 phones on two separate accounts due to the desperation of one of the agents trying to sell me a phone. She messed up my accounts and I was left to be responsible to pay for activation fees and the middle of the month billing fees due to finally merging the accounts. After trying to reconcile this issue for weeks. The customer service agents are rude. The wait times are long as hell. I never called Verizon and had to be switched to a million departments or experienced super wait long times. I am currently on hold with AT&T on two different phones. I have been on the call with different agents since 10 am and it’s now 2:17pm as I am writing this review. I never write reviews but this has been the worst experience ever. Please avoid going with this telephone service no matter how cheaper it may look it’s all a LIE!Update: I am still on the phone with the agents due to multiple accounts created by these inexperienced agents. Who in turn can’t fix your issue because it’s not their department just for them to transfer me multiple times and guess what your on hold for an hour. I wish I could screenshot these calls today. It’s currently 5:19 pm AT&T has taken my entire Saturday away! & guess what? I still have yet to get my issues resolved. This has been a total nightmare.,0
"The director of phone support should be arrested and deported. The goal of ATT phone support is to keep you on hold until to give up. After the minimal hour wait, you will speak to an agent that will need to transfer you to anoth agent. Another hour wait. Then an agent will tell you that they fixed the problem but they didn't. Days or weeks later you will start the whole process over. Stay away from ATT. Every other phome service has better support.",0
4 hours of my day on hold with ATT today about a downed line in my yard after a recent storm. You know how far I got? BEING TOLD TO GO TO A LOCAL STORE TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!!!! are you kidding me??,0
Terrible Hold Time Even To Pay a Bill u have to wait 1 hour for and agent and the worse collection company also they use,0
I signed up for AT&T fiber and made an appointment took the day off to be here!! No show !! Rescheduled for another day took day off from work and what another  NO SHOW!! At this point I would pay more for internet service from someone else than give this Criminal Organization another chance !! If I could give them less than 1 ⭐️ I would definitely give them 0 ⭐️..I see why their workers are on strike they don’t want to work for them  either !!!! Hope they stay on strike !!,0
I would use a walkie talkie before going with AT&T again. Expensive and service is awful. They want to charge late fees but will not send me my bill. I have to go looking for it.,0
"I just ported in my number from t-mobile 7/27, to At&t. I was informed my bill was $46 dollars a month, with all my discounts, by two different agents. The date is now 8/30, and the charge for the bill that needs to be paid on 9/14 is $166. My activation fee was waived, I have an internet bundle, I have a union discount, and other fees were waived for porting in my number. I was warned not to switch to AT&T for this exact reason. But the experience so far since switching is worse than I was told. They have horrible network of communication between stores, customer service and information in there database. You will get a different answer every time you talk to some one new. AT&T, is easily the worst service provider I have ever had by far. And I have only had them a month. I will be switching back immediately!",0
The worse service the rudest agents and are far from treating it caring for their customers. I was a loyal customer for over 30 years and my service was suspended a week before my bill was due. My information was leaked 3 times and never received an apology or offered any kind of incentive to remain a customer. Couldn't login to .y account due to them wanting to verify using my phone number which was suspended and told by three agents sorry we cant helo you. Dont use att unless you like getting bent over,0
"Att made promises (Nick Schwartz) that if I signed up for phone and internet I would get a $20 discount on my bill. We'll after 6 months and 4 phone calls to him each month after the first two not being discounted he tells me I waited to long to contact him and now there's nothing he can do but I should call support and ask if there's anything they can do.  Called support and was told that promotion no longer exists but they can give me $15 off a month from that date forward and they would issue a (6/18/2024) $100 reward card to compensate me for the extra $120 charges on my past 6 bills. Meanwhile I also have a claimed $50 reward card supposedly in the works for my internet service rewards. Then received email that it was mailed july,4 2024. So today is 8/29/24 and I call to ask what is going on with the rewards cards supposedly being mailed and was told even though I never received $50 rewards card they would not issue a new one and that my $100 rewards card should be able to be claimed 8 weeks after approval and that that was still 2 weeks away.  Now my math skills are pretty decent so I replied 6/18 - 8/29 is around 10 weeks.  Then the person I was speaking with really tried to sales pitch me to upgrade my phone and add a line for $45 more a month. Needless to say I told her she was really missing me off now and I would start shopping for a new service provider for my phone and internet.",0
Worst company ever they quote you one thing over the phone and they just send you Higher Bill do not do auto pay beware.Stay away from them.,0
"On August 28th I went to the store in Gastonia on Cox road to find out if the phone I needed was available. As it was not, I went to the store on Myrtle School road in Gastonia. The representative, Jordan, was with other clients. I was not greeted. While still working with another client, Jordan asked me how she could help. I explained that I was looking specifically for Samsung s24 ultra with 512 GB of memory and came to her as it was unavailable at Cox road store. She informed me that she had two phones available at that location. I chose the color of the phone. She proceeded with the trade-in. As she was still working with both me and another person, I had to do all the installation on my new phone without her help. She did not go over any policies, protection plan options which she just added without asking me. When I got home and started setting up my phone I found out that she sold me a Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra with 256 GB. The next day I went back to the store. She said that she would not be able to replace the phone. She was not able to make a return either. I spent 3 and 1/2 hours at the store with her trying to help both me and another client at the same time again. I ended up leaving the store because she was not able to solve my issue and she sent me away. I had to go to the corporate store on Cox road where all my problems were solved by another representative without any issues. However I did have to still pay the restocking fee which I find unfair. On top of everything, Jordan was smelling strongly of marijuana, she was dressed yesterday in a mini skirt and today in jeans with multiple holes in them, something weird on her head, and looked completely unrepresentable and unprofessional. at one point I had to sit down because the smell of marijuana was that strong.",0
"WE HAVE BEEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR 2 DAYS WITH NO WAY OF FINDING OUT WHEN IT WILL BE BACK ON... THE APP IS TERRIBLE,  THE CALL CENTER IS EVEN WORSE .. WITH ALL THAT SAID THE INTERNET SERVICE IS THE SLOWEST IN THE AREA. SPECTRUM IS FASTER BUT UNRELIABLE.",0
"Keep your other services! I regret dropping Tmobile! My bill is never the same. It goes up and up. Also once direct tv merged with them forget it. I use to love direct TV but not anymore. I had my service suspended and it was turned on without any updated warning, no email no nothing. They charged me a whole month I never used. They refused to take it off and said there is no way to confirm I didn't use it. Like seriously do you not have access to see my usage. Basically insinuating I'm a liar!! Stay away! I regret it all the time!",0
Horrible Company!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!!,0
"Absolute WORST coverage and WORST service EVER!! AVOID AVOID AVOID!! Regrettably we believed the promises of superiority. LIES. It was ALL LIES! We were also told we had 90 days to drop if we weren't satisfied. Sure, they'll ""let"" you drop, but it will cost dearly. In the mean time we have ZERO cell service in the middle of the biggest business district in the state, with work that can't happen without constant phone use.",0
"If you looking for an unlimited cellphone service.Don't go to ATT, avoid them. Choose cricket or metro.Phone service sometimes work others no.And internet movil is a joke.",0
"Red Flag 🚩 I recently had an extremely unnerving experience with AT&T and its employees. It seemed to be an out of country call center for AT&T. My original reason for the phone call was to address an email I had received stating that my services were going to be suspended, even though I had made a payment arrangement for August 3, 2024. The representative said she saw the date and would adjust it for me. Immediately during a phone call she said she could potentially save me money. She said that my bill was $571 per month, and that she could reduce that down to $268 per month. She ended up selling me, four watches, and adding on an iPad, which the IPad I did not approve of, nor have I received. When I called back in to speak with another representative a day or two later, the gentleman said that it was a bad move and then I had screwed myself. He also said that he was going to send me a replacement for a phone that I had just recently lost that day earlier. That phone has since been canceled on someone’s end, but not mine. That employee said that I would be basically paying the same amount as I was paying previously, and that there would be no way that my bill would be $268. This is only one of many issues that I’ve had with your company over the past 10 years, and especially since you became linked to DIRECTV.I am requesting for an immediate review of my entire history, and that I am contacted by a senior representative who can make decisions for my account. As I have spent well over 100 hours at a bare minimum, *(including at least 2 full days on the phone for issues, which were days of employment for me)  being transferred to departments that are not correct, dealing with issues that never get dealt with, and also trying to get my account corrected.Here are some of the issuers I have experienced:-AT&T associates selling products without dealing with the original reason for call-Lying to consumers about cost and final pricing with little to no transparency-Over 100 hours easy on calls related to issues with accounts-$50 for screen replacement and told it had insurance and with new contract that was voided when I got the new iPad.-False advertising - As of May I have no more than 1 bar and/or no access to 5g. Calls are dropped and/or broken up constantly even with AT&T representatives on the call. Promised a cell booster by rep and when transferred to technician they said they had no info about it and denied it.-Deceptive and illicit business practices resulting in lost time, increased billing, and unaffordable services-Transfering my current plans to new ones when they want to sell new products, At least 3 new 2 year contracts on accounts recently.-Making arrangements without documenting or sending email confirmation, resulting in the account being suspended and the full bill being due to turn the accounts back on.-And the data breach has leaked my personal information to the dark web.I do not want to continue having these issues with your company. I would expect that this would be handled immediately, as I am limited on my time for reparations. I will also be forwarding this email to The Attorney Generals office and the FTC, along with other agency outlets if this is unattended. Please note that I have been a customer since well before Cingular wireless in the early 2000’s. I also own three businesses in Des Moines, Iowa, and partner with some of the largest businesses in our state. I hope this reaches the appropriate individuals, look forward to speedy response.This email was sent over two weeks ago. Since then, I have spoke with a store manager, who said they were going to take care of it. This manager refuses to keep contact with me or even give me an update. I have filed a complaint with the FCC, and forwarded emails on to every possible outlet I can find.",0
I'm a new customer just over the 30 day period.  A recent outage resulted is us not being able to access concert tickets on our phones. So we couldn't after tickets purchased.   After outage I still had phone issues that started prior to the outage unresolved.  I spent hours on the phone with multiple people.   Once resolved all that was offered was a 5.00 outage credit. Not even close to what I'm out for 2 concert tickets.  A manager still would not budge.  I will never recommend the service and when I transfer service I will not accept being charged for an unreliable service 😑.  I have never been treated so poorly.  Even reached out to our sales rep who was great upon the sale and kind at first.  Then tells me to change providers.  And he no longer works there.,0
I was so excited to switch from T-Mobil to AT&T and service is so disappointing.They are WAY worse than T-Mobil which I thought was hard to do.But upside they said I could buy $250 boost for my house:/ they could see my area is not good for AT&T once I called to complain.I live in a busy area with 85k people.They don’t have honest billing or at least up front about it. First bill $870Shocked.  But it would be worth it if I got service.   Would avoid if in Leander or Austin TX at all cost.,0
The worst CS EVER!! JUST GOT MY BILL TODAY AUG 28TH...DUE DATE SEPT 7TH....HOW WOULD THEY GET MY PAYMENT IN TIME VIA POSTAL SERVICE...THEY WOULD NOT...AND CHARGE ME LATE FEETHEY GET BREACHED...MY PASSCODE NOW DOES NOT EXIST....SPENT AN HOUR ON THE PHONE TODAY! Call dropped 2x and NO CALL BACK...3RD REP SAID COULD NOT TAKE PAYMENT INFO TODAY and apply to due date on Sept 7th IT WOULD BE TAKEN OUT TODAY...HORRIBLE  COMPANY...GOING TO DROP THEM,0
"price increases, customer service agents lie to get your money. Do not use them and if you can run away from them.",0
"AVOID Att at all costs.  Service was abominable. Paid for 50 mbs, got 20.  Cell service unavailable in parts of So. Calif.  When I tried to cancel they made it extremely difficult and ended up charging $188 after I cancelled, threatening to use a collection agency if I didn’t pay.  ATT appears to be losing customers at an enormous rate, and from my experience for good reason.",0
"Worst service ever spent hours on the phone trying to get my service on for data issues they were having, had my private information compromised, having phone issues the entire time, does not get service everywhere like it advertises 5g is better than Verizon, when my friend had Verizon in a no data zone her phone worked and Mines did not on 5G terrible. Will reach out to Morgan and Morgan.",0
"If I could put a negative mark I would. Do not recommend this company. Had issues with account, called over 8 times with same issue. Thought it was resolved. A year Later, they sent me to COLLECTIONS for fees I didn't owe!!!!!! Hate this company..",0
My husband and I went to an att store to setup a new plan with them. We both came from Verizon but on our parents plans. The transfer was not done correctly. The porting pins Verizon was not entered during the transfer. This resulted in us both losing our phone service in a few days of use. Mine happened first since I kept my old phone and husband stayed on his parents plan until it arrived. I spent three hours on phone with att and Verizon and my mom to get the porting pin. My husband is now going through this. This should not be this hard nor stressful. We are spending over $140 a month and not having any service. We are going to a cheaper service since att charges a lot for bad service.,0
"Bad bad experience bad bad customer serviceIs insane I don’t know cry or laugh!!!Get a promotional 50% Father’s Day and now charge me whole 100% so my advice is never never get a promotional from att, plus every month increase charges and you can try to call and call but nothing, now I try to go out of this nightmare!!!!",0
"At&t worst company for internet, I haven't had my internet for last 12 days in my business and their customer service can't tell you when they can restore the service.",0
I wish I could give a zero for this company. The worse company ever! Phones doesn’t works and they charge you a huge bill for a phone that won’t work at all! No connection or anything! Terrible terrible. I’m being charged $300 almost $400  for a bill that was supposed to be $110 a month,0
"Horrible service!! People try to contact me for days in and can't reach me. I call my wife, whom has  the same service as we have 4 different lines with this horrible company, and it will go straight to voice mail as I'm sitting next to her to see and try to understand what might be happening. But I've come to the conclusion this is a horrible company. I'll be leaving this awful service.",0
Anytime you need to talk to someone they transfer you around for an hour or 2. They don’t give any info to the person  you’re transferred to meaning you have to start over. Or they transfer you to the main customer service number where you also have to start over.,0
"AT&T is the worst company in the world. I joined the plan at Costco department store and imported my four lines from T-Mobile when the AT&T sales at Costco said that the deal is good for Costco executive members. Since I joined the plan the phons are not working. I am unable to text, call out or receive the call.when I call Costco VIP, it goes to South Africa, when I call in the USA, put me on hold over 2 hrs and the tech support is unable to solve the issues at all. I am very disappointed at AT &T service.",0

That didn't keep you from charging me another $60 because you told me you ""could turn it back on.""Come to find out, they cannot?!  Okay.I will work out of a cafe' for 2 weeks until I move and spend 10x the money for food/coffee out of GENERAL PRINCIPLE to keep my $$ out of the hands of ATT.Worst. Service.

I have the Internet Air for Business I have had it under a month and It started out great then in a week it slowed down to with under a 1.0 Upload their tech support did 3 hours of over the phone work and I still had to go into the store because it was pinging in off of North and South Carolina and not Michigan towers.  Then I was told by service to get a new sim card in the store.  I was also told that they can cancel my other line which was a hotspot for business that did not work that I had to do it over the phone they did not have access; which the rep on the phone stated that I needed to go in store.  Moving onward I have been working this week when I got the new sim and the Internet Air went out again while working I called support I was on the phone 3.30 hours with 5 transfers and attitude from reps; when requesting a supervisor I was told they are already engaged and cannot take the call after an 1 hr of waiting for a supervisor I was transferred to another rude rep.  I hung up!  Then this morning I was experiencing the same speeds and I called I have been on the phone for another  3 hours and transferred 6 x with no resolution.  AT&T are beyond horrible and I do not recommend any Business internet service through them with the Internet AIR.,0
"Used to be a good service,  had then for years. Last year has been terrible. Can't reach anyone, lots of runaround and do not value my business.

There are better plans with other providers, and customer service is a joke",0
"Horrible service and even worst customer service! On the phone for damn near 3 hours to add TWO LINES! What did Micheal the supervisor do, LIE! Talking about this would be easy yada ya.

"Worst Customer Service I’ve ever experienced. I have an internet outage business I manage . I will call on a Monday and I am told the earliest they can send someone is Friday, I will take it since I had no other option. No call , No show. When I called again I am told the same thing, same results. To have someone to talk to takes about two hours waiting on phone. It’s over a month now still no internet and no one has come by or called whereas the last Rep I spoke with promised to call and follow up.What a horrible service. I wished I had another service provider in that zip code",0
"BEWARE- YOU HAVE TO WAIT LIKE 2 HOURS TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE just to discover you aren’t getting sent a shipping label, you just need a code- then the next you call, you just want to know why you are being charged anything- you get transferred back and forth until customer service closes and also, you thankfully have a login and realize you are charged almost 5 dollars for using ATT air for less than an hour, before realizing the internet you are sharing is just as good and significantly cheaper so you return the device, yet still get charged $4.39- hahaha okay- I WILL NEVER EVER EVER USE ANY ATT SERVICES- THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!

It was never applied.Post month response: It may take a few months for the old devices to process and have your account apply all rebates and offers.  (My fault for forgetting.)Time lapse 1 year: Need another phone.Informed the more lines, more the savings.  Informed billed would go from $270 to $210 with the extra line. Billed increased another $40.Issue #3.  Three attempts to the same store to add the military ""Signature Program"" to my account.  Provided military ID with driver's license that states ""Veteran"".

Then they tell me that I did not need to be home. Have taken the afternoon off at a loss of 160 dollars for no reason. Their response was oh I am sorry. No offer of compensation for their incompetence or lack of correspondence.",0
"I have nothing but problems since switching to AT&T.  First, they claimed they did not receive our phones via mail when I had signed receipts from their employee.  I got that resolved, but they thought they were doing me a favor when they were wrong.Now, I cancelled a phone.  My plan was 2 phones and my husband died recently and I disconnected his phone and returned it [fortunately this time they indicated receipt].  Now I am trying to figure out the bill for one line.  Every month it is different, each time I call or visit the store I am given a different amount.  For two phones the total was $173.  I wrongly assumed it would be about half that.  Wrong, it is looking like $129.81, I was told $72.99 in the store, $99.00 by an agent via chat and see in my account that is $129.81.  I questioned why it would not be about half and was told that the discounts only apply to multiple lines.  So if you are single and use one phone, they don't care about you.  You are paying the highest rate possible.  I am looking elsewhere where one phone/one person is valued.  Worst mistake ever going to AT&T, do not switch no matter who you have.",0
Worst customer service. Don’t waste your time & money if you have other providers choose them. They have hired worst people to give phone support. They will cut the call on you.Very disappointed.,0

This monopoly allows consumers information to be stolen and shared all across the black web allowing your bank accounts to hacked and drained then at the detriment of the poor customer demands payment after they access 2 payments from your account in the same month. Slows down service because you demand accountability for the transactions on your account but you are nobody so there will be no accountability. Class action suits are not the formula to provide accountability there needs to be something done to protect & prevent . I’m just a disabled veteran trying to survive only on a monthly income.  My account was hacked giving way for my banking account to be accessed and drained. But do you think AT&T cares about a customer that has been loyal over 2 decades:. They don’t!!,0
I purchased an extender due to my internet coming in and out the extender was right next to my tv made no difference this company charged me still for months I never used service had to do a chargeback had Elisabeth from AT&T presidential services reach out acting like she would help she completely stopped responding to my emails. I won’t ever trust this company again !,0
"At&T cut our copper lines 5 months ago without reason or warning leaving us without phones or internet. We are a small family business. They cost is over $10,000 in loss of sales and created a nightmare of a situation. After months of trying to call them they refuse to fix the situation by restoring our service. We have not been able to pay our bills without internet because our credit cards did not go through. AT&T cut our service, refuses to restore it, forcing us to go to Comcast. Now, AT&T refuses to port over our phone number we've had for 40 years. I would like an explanantion",0
THIS MAY BE AN AUTHORED DEALER BUT AT&T HAS THE WORST SERVICE. I JOINED MY HUSBAND PLAN SO WE CAN SAVE AND IT HAS BEEN THE WORST EXPERIENCE. MY DAUGHTER IS IN COLLEGE AND HER SERVICE IS NO GOOD UNLESS CONNECTED TO THE WIFI. MINE PHONE SERVICE DOESN'T EVEN WORK WHEN I GO OUT OF TOWN. THEY ARE HORRIBLE. IF YOU THINKING OF GETTING AT&T DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"DO NOT USE AT&T!!!!  I had just horrendous problems throughout my whole time with AT&T. From being sold phones that did not work to being charged for an entire month of service after the account was cancelled. The customer service is horrid if you can even get to talk to a real person. DO NOT USE AT&T!!!!!USE TMOBILE!!! I'm much happier now with out my outstanding service from them, especially a billing department that knows what its doing.",0
Awful company. Moved out of my house 7 months ago and still unable to cancel my internet. 3 hour hold times with retention and then they hang up.,0
We allowed ATT workers in our property to do their work in our backyard. I had asked them nicely to clean up after they finish their job and to make sure they leave things as they were. I took photos to show the disarray they left upon finishing their tasks five days ago. I shared this information with ATT reps and they have been unable to send someone to arrange those items lying on the ground in the manner they had originally found them. Quite irresponsible!,0
"I learned a long ago that AT&T can't be trusted to give you a straight answer. Unfortunately, I relearned that lesson recently when I ordered their internet service.Their website said it was available at my home address but it turned out it's not (one agent told me it was - another told me it wasn't). It wasn't easy returning the device to AT&T - an agent told me I could return it either to any AT&T store or to any UPS.  The AT&T store I took it to said 'no, you have to return it to UPS'.  UPS took the return with no problems. This whole fiasco, from beginning to end, consumed about 6 hours of my time. Both my wait time to speak with an agent AND to receive a call back was 1-1/5 hours. Never, ever again!  This is yet a followup to my ongoing saga with AT&T:  They've done 2 incredibly more stupid things, causing me to spend an hour on a phone call with them and replying to another senseless email they sent.  The hour phone call was in response to a bill sent me for use of the internet device, which of course, I was never able to use.  The email I received and had to reply to was explaining I'd returned the device along with a photo of the UPS receipt show when and where.  Hopefully, this is THE END.",0
"I called ATT a month ago for who knows what. While I was on the phone the rep (who I’m sure makes commission for up-selling) talked me into changing my plan (the one I’ve had for 20 years with no problems) promising that the 5G service would be much better and load faster. It was also going to cost an additional $5/mo (of course it is!) I agreed - how could I not?Of course - she never told me that there was no going back if I changed my mind. Which I did because the new service SUCKS! Now I can’t even load ANY websites, do any internet searches or use any apps unless I’m on WiFi. I’m not using any public/unsecured WiFi services so now my phone is useless. And even the phone calls are messed up - static, usually disconnect and I have to place the call multiple times.Thanks a lot ATT. After 20+ years I’m going to switch to Verizon. They can’t possibly worse than ATT.Also ATT - I can NEVER log into my account. And since you bought Directv you screwed that up too.I’m fed up and over ATT!",0
"Zero rating would be correct. I upgraded 3 phones and had to return them when I received the new phones. I just got one of the phones returned to me with a letter saying I didn't return them in the allowed time period, and am be charged $900 for my troubles. Customer service could not and will not work on a resolution. I will be changing my provider and canceling my DTV because of this unprofessionalism.",0

So disappointed with this company.",0
"After spending far more time than any customer should have trying to figure out why the ‘Blocked Contacts’ feature on my iPhone is ineffective, I was on another 24-minute call with AT&T’s tech support. This was just the latest in many calls and chat sessions that have gone nowhere. The same issue remains unresolved—and it’s been years.I’m talking about an iPhone 11-Pro I purchased directly from an AT&T store just before COVID-19 hit. So, this problem has been festering for quite a while. Let me get straight to the point: I’m done. I refuse to be your unpaid, unappreciated beta tester. I’m done dealing with spam calls slipping through despite being ‘blocked’ by a feature that should be reliable. But why do ALL blocked numbers ""slip through""?We’re talking about years of this nonsense—years of you pretending that spammers somehow outsmart your technology. Any competent business would have flagged and fixed this issue by now—either out of respect for their customers or to cut costs. Unless the real goal is to keep customers frustrated, waste time on tech support, and eventually push them toward paid “upgrades.” All the while, small business owners like myself bear the cost of wasted time and lost productivity.I decided to test this myself. Following your instructions, I called my cell phone from one of our business lines and blocked the number. The call went straight to voicemail—no ring, no notification. So why doesn’t it work this way for every other blocked caller? Is it that hard to make this technology consistent? Or is it designed to fail?Given AT&T’s resources, I find it hard to believe you can’t solve this. Especially when offering “upgrades” like AT&T Call Protect, AT&T Mobile Security, and AT&T ActiveArmor—each conveniently priced at $3.99 per line per month. I’m old enough to remember when the federal government broke up AT&T’s monopoly. What I see now feels like déjà vu—the same tactics that got you into trouble. And let me assure you, those tactics won’t work in today’s market.I’ve been a loyal customer since the 1970s. Not because you were the cheapest but because you were supposed to be the most reliable. I’ve paid a premium for that reliability—$115 for the remaining two lines, to be exact. But now? I’m looking at $15 per line elsewhere, with service that’s just as good, if not better. And to top it off, I’m sitting here with one bar of signal, practically within arm’s reach of the state Capitol.After decades of loyalty, I’m finished. I won’t keep paying for what I once believed was trust and reliability when it’s clear those values are no longer upheld. I urge others facing similar issues to reconsider their loyalty to AT&T. It’s time to explore more reliable alternatives.",0
I paid off 2 lines to save money and my other lines monthly payments increased. The extra charges that they don’t tell you about it’s outrageous.,0
"Been without wifi for over a week now since the date to fix my wifi keeps getting pushed back, first to last Saturday, then to Sunday, then to Monday, then to Thursday, then to yesterday, and now to next week's Wednesday. Frick att, they don't wanna fix my fricking problem",0
"I was given AT & T reward card with a value of $ 100.00Apparently there was some renovation going in house, entire floor remodeling including kitchen remodeling and we by mistake lost/ misplaced our reward card. The reward card was dated with expiration date of 4/24. We found that lost/misplaced card upon completion of remodeling, but it was too late since card was expired. I called reward card service and they mentioned may be AT & T customer service can help since card was issued with promotional services. Called customer service and based on talk with them, they refer back to card services.If both divisions belongs to AT & T one of them should able to resolve the matter with some kind of compensation/ replacement of card. But my all effort gone in vain. Not only that customer service even mentioned that we can reduced your phone bill by reducing your speed and that way you can save $ 10.00 per month in bill and recover your loss in next 10 month or so. I don’t understand that approach at all.At least they could have offered other way  by mentioning that ok let’s reduce your bill or give you break in different way to compensate.In my case basically it’s a total loss for me.I learned my lesson. I will wait and see what other companies will offer after such experience.",0
"AT&T installed new high speed internet lines into my neighborhood.  They came to my door offering the new internet service that included a $20 monthly discount because I had AT&T internet at my another residence in another city.  When my discount did not show up on my first bill, I called them and they said the discount would take several months to take effect but I would eventually be credited for the discounted amount.  After four months I called customer service again about getting the discount applied to my bill and receiving the credit for the first four months.  I was told by the supervisor that I would not be receiving the discount at all because I had moved  residences in the other city.  They said I would get the discount because I had another internet account. I still have that internet account in another residence 2 miles from the original one.  Their excuse not to give me the discount seems very unfair.  I will take them to arbitration and will be very surprised if I lose due to fairness and common sense.",0
I broke my phone and was convinced to upgrade to a post pay plan from my prepaid. The phone I got didn’t work and caused nothing but problems. My prepaid bill can put the 13th of the month and was charged. Then the charged me to upgrade which had for less than a day because I couldn’t get the phone to work. They said they switched everything back the way it was but kept getting wired messages from them about stuff that I have never had so I called to ask and sure asI was still on the post paid. To switch it back the charged me anothermonth on top of the stupid restocking fee of damn near everything I spent. So for this one months worth of service I have now been charged over 300 dollars. Well I am either getting compensation or they lost ola customer for life. This is the worst easy to say thank you for being a customer. Your business is disgustingly corrupt and I will never ever suggest anyone go to att. I would rather communicate by pony express!!!!!!!!!  I am still in disbelief that this also took a hole week of fighting to get my phone back to where it was supposed to be. I am also going to be calling a lawyer and the bbb to report what has happened. And on top of that you whine and cry about my language when you get in your car to go home you music says worse things than I do. Stupid stuff right there,0
Another day without service..I'm done.. switching to Verizon,0
"Took out an international plan when travelling abroad but was nevertheless charged as if this never happened. Auto pay took the money out of our account, but when challenging this, was told a credit would be passed on the next bill.

We got a contract with AT&T through Sam’s club.  They offered a good rate with a discount for returning our old phones.  We mailed our old phones to the address provided and never received the discount.  When we called them they said they never received them.  We called trying to correct the situation but were unable to.  Now we got our new bill and there was an extra $40 on it.  Now they claim that a promotional offer through Sam’s club ran out and we will have this charge until our contract runs out.  This was never stated when we started our service.  We will never use them again.  Horrible experience from the beginning,0
Poor customer service unprofessional prices are extremely high while service is poor. AT&T should be shut down immediately . Data breach… they have a lawsuit currently going on ..,0
"Terrible service and reception. And ever increasing bills. They quoted me around $85 per month and my bills have been approximately $200 per month going up each month. I’m paying four times at ATT for cell service only what I was paying at xfinity for three lines and internet. Also when I travel outside of Houston, I get no service/coverage and in certain areas it goes into SOS mode with zero service",0
"THEY WILL SCAM YOU!!! DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT FOR YOUR OWN FINANCIAL SAFETY EVER USE AT&T. YOU WILL GET SCAMMED.AT&T has been charging my account since October 2022 fraudulently. I moved apartments and cancelled my services with them in October 2022. They then requested I send back the equipment which I did. They continued charging me every month for 2 years and NEVER sent a single notification via email or mail that they were charging me monthly. They kept charging me after I cancelled their services and returned their equipment. Two weeks ago, I discovered they were doing this and called them to be refunded for those backdated months. The employee named Sandro (account manager, in the loyalty department) told us to cancel it again on august 7th 2024 so we would not continue to be charged and said he would open an investigation. He said the investigation takes up to about 7 days to process so to call back then. Upon calling back 8 times since then, I have not had a single representative able to help us move the process along or have any information to give us. Today, I called back again (and was escalated to several managers) and they told us that if we had kept the account open and not cancelled it with Sandro, then right now they would’ve been able to backdate the cancellation so we could have been reimbursed for those months. So an AT&T representative guided us in the complete wrong way and now caused us not to be able to be reimbursed for those charges. Not to mention, AT&T can check the usage and see that we were not using their services at all since October 2022 (when we moved out of our apartment) AND have an email confirmation for returning their equipment. Every representative kept telling us there is no record of a cancellation so we basically are correctly being charged. How can that be possible when I have a confirmation of returning the equipment? Did I just randomly want to return your equipment and continue paying for internet even though I don’t even have your equipment and no longer live there? makes no sense. Then they tried to say the returned equipment could be for a reason unrelated to the cancellation, like maybe an exchange. BUT THEN WHERE IS MY EXCHANGE? There is no exchange. It was for a cancellation. I have been on the phone cumulatively for over 6 hours trying to resolve this issue and no one even cares to help me in a meaningful way. I have been transferred to Loyalty, Customer Service,Billing, even Collection. The worst part is despite all of this headache, numerous phone reps will put me on hold and just never return. I have dealt with this so many times, I’m not sure if this is a tactic to get off the call Scott free when they cannot figure out what to do, but please try to imagine how annoying that would be. Every manager has told me the best they can do is credit my account for 1 month of the back dated charges. How can a company like AT&T have such an abysmal resolution process? I will be sharing this story with as many friends and family members as possible",0
"Complaint: After seeing almost every other company offering plans for what i consider the same level of service for substantially less per month, i reached out to AT&T to see if there was anyway to lower my bill. I figured that with over 20 years of being a loyal customer they would be able to do something, however to my surprise they weren't willing to do anything so i cancelled my service and transferred to Verizon for over 100 dollars less per month. Upon transferring my service i made sure to pay my balance to $0 while i was in store to ensure i was paying whatever the current balances due were paid. Now, i get a call 2 months later saying i still owe almost $300, which is impossible because you can't cancel service AND i also transferred my 2 phone numbers to the new carrier. After speaking with a support manager Alex he kept telling me it was for a past due balance and didn't care to look at the facts (it's not possible to transfer a line or service altogether especially to a competitor if there is a balance due). Alex tried to say that the final payment was reversed to which i told him no it wasn't and would provide my bank statement as proof...then he said ""i'm sorry sir that must be a lie."" He didn't request for me to send it to AT&T to clear up the discrepancy, no, after 20 years with the company I'm now a liar because I won't let them extort me for another $300 dollars. If i hadn't transferred to a new provider i bet that bill wouldn't have mysteriously appeared. I'll also be filing a complaint with the attorney general as well as posting this exact review on every social media channel i can because this is a horrible company that everyone should stay away from!After being a customer of AT&T for over 20 years there is nothing good to say regarding this company. AT&T could care less about their customers and have made that blatantly clear to me.",0
AT&T makes company policies just to find ways to screw their customers over. Just so you know AT&T now lock eSIMS (which in my opinion shouldn't be legal) and will not let you add a second one even if you are still paying a monthly bill with them. I have never had so many problems as a loyal customer before. My mother and I have had a line with them for decades and are honestly probably going to switch now because there are just too many awful experiences to count anymore. I don't understand why AT&T does not care about their customers. If anyone is planning on traveling do not do so with AT&T. They have super high daily costs on their international plans and will lock your SIM on your iphone so you are not allowed to get a local number. We will not be associating or dealing with AT&T any longer after such an awful experience.,0
"Worst. Company. On. This. PLANET!!!!!If you're thinking of switching providers, or looking for a service, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go with ATT. They are completely incompetent and continue to mess things up. Yall should be out of business.",0
"In the last 5 months I have been without internet for 4 weeks. This time I had an appointment on Tues and nobody showed up.

"1) my phone was disabled twice months apart. The other day my phone was disabled for 5 hours, the day before I could make calls. Yesterday I found out my second phone they set up 11 months ago could not receive calls, they fixed it today. But they would not credit my account for the non working phone. I went to two different AT&T stores, the first one said they were a satellite store, so they sent me across town to a “main store” and they said they couldn’t do anything either. I pay $140.00 for two phones, now with my new different wireless provider I pay $130.00 for 4 phones. Thank you AT&T! And my internet cost went down also!I would like to thank the awful service techs, and support staff for saving me money. Without your attention to do nothing, I would have never changed my phone, my internet, and my family’s phone and internet!",0

July 26 2024 my internet just went out. Tried all the reset crap 2 or 3 times. Called customer service and they sent out a technician. He said the line was broken and a new line had to be ran. After 3 no show scheduled times buried cable crew came out to bury a line that hasn’t even been laid yet. This happened 3 three different days. Finally a crew came out and ran and buried the line and left open on both ends for the technician to hook up. Two day later still nobody showed up. Every time you call and schedule a technician he never showed up. Come to find out the buried cable contractor never turned the finished ticket in. Called and scheduled a time again yesterday 8/19/24 again a no show. Called again first thing this morning and technician is supposed to show again today 8/20/24 we will see if they show today.,0
"Trash. The service was subpar, but nothing to complain about. What I can, and WILL ALWAYS, complain about is that AT&T basically stole money from me.I called in September 2023 to have my service cancelled because I was moving to a different city and honestly couldn’t care less about keeping my internet going. The dude I talked to was nice enough and said he’d cancel, no problem. The thing is, he never cancelled my service. I found out in June 2024 after being charged for 5 months of internet nobody used. I know it’s foolish to hardly ever check my bank account, but I didn’t even think about it since I was under the impression my service was cancelled. I didn’t even receive emails about upcoming bills or activity on my account, so I really didn’t think anything was wrong.After discovering the charges, I called immediately to plead my case. I ultimately bit the bullet because the original guy never logged my request for cancellation, and there was nothing anyone could do without solid proof. I was pissed, yeah, but at least my service was cancelled.Now, the woman who cancelled my service told me I didn’t have to return the equipment because it was an older model. Guess who got fkn swindled, though!! Me, baby!!! I just got an email saying I owe $174+ because I haven’t returned my equipment.Same deal, I talked to some guy who didn’t know more than what was written on the back of his hand. He regurgitated what my account says without any attempt to reconcile the situation. He basically ended with, “pay it or don’t 🤷🏻‍♂️.”So, because AT&T is absolute garbage and can’t manage their records, I’m out over $700 (9 monthly bills + equipment). Absolutely nothing I can do about it now, since I moved out of the apartment and disposed of the equipment 10 months ago.",0
"This is a terrible company, customer service is almost non-existent. Coverage is terrible even on top tier plan it's slow, they throttle constantly and I have frequent drop-outs in Seattle one of the largest cities in the US. I also have international roaming but when I went to Vancouver I had no service at all while my girlfriend with T-Mobile had excellent service. We had to use her phone to finish navigation. All and I mean ALL my devices are purchased from Apple not ATT as I hate having companies lock me in when I own the product. ATT locked my phone anyway and refused to unlock it. First 24 hours then 48, then they said I tried too many times and to wait 30 days which is I'm pretty sure illegal to hold someone prisoner like that. Especially when not on a payment plan for devices and the devices were purchased externally through Apple. I no kidding spent 2 days and over six hours on the phone with customer service and still didn't get it resolved. I will never give ATT another dollar of my money. Even the reps at Apple store said ATT is horrible and the only carrier who tries to control to that level or intrude on personal data like they do.",0

I currently have internet home phone & wireless and when I say these people is killing my pockets I am done! Every month they adding extra funds on top your bill!

I ain’t seen anything like it I am gone I no longer recommend or will stay with this company!! They are getting over on any & everyone!!,0
"AT&T is horrible, they lie just to get you in then they jerk you around with your service and your payments. You will never know from month to month what you owe on occasion there will be $50-$100 bill increases with no change to your plan or usage. One person will assure you of one thing while something entirely different will be the outcome and then you are stuck with it. I have been stuck with them for nearly 4 horribly miserable years. DO NOT GO TO AT&T.",0
"I would give them a zero star if I could! The tech support was never able to get the phone number working, so we cancelled the line and went with another carrier after over a month.  However, the billing department continued to charge us not only for the month we were trying to get the phone up and running; they charged for the entire next month.  So basically, I was stuck paying for 2 months of service I never received, or they would report me to credit agency!",0
"I am an extremely frustrated customer. AT&T’s internet service has been incredibly disappointing. I’ve had to call them about 20 times, and each time, I get transferred to different departments without any resolution. They’ve told me my account is too complicated to handle, and as a result, my internet was cut off.I came home from work on Friday to find that my internet was disconnected. I called AT&T immediately, but despite their assurances that they were glad to help, nothing got resolved. Instead, I was passed around like a hot potato between departments. I spent nearly 7 hours on the phone with them, from 4 PM to 11 PM, only to be told they couldn’t help me and that I’d have to wait until Monday for the Sales department to reopen in their business hours.What’s worse is that I did speak with the Sales department during my initial call, but they transferred me to another department. After 7 hours that, I was told I needed to go back to Sales again. This is the worst service I’ve ever experienced, especially when I was already exhausted from work.I’m really want to changing my internet provider, but unfortunately, my apartment has a contract with AT&T, so I’m stuck. I’ve already expressed my concerns to the apartment management, urging them to cut ties with AT&T. They left me without internet for the entire weekend, which is unacceptable.",0
Bought a iPhone 14 and was told they cannot unlock it and sent me somewhere else,0
"My wife and I shared a grandfathered data plan with my mom until she died. My mom didn’t write down her AT&T password or passcode, so whether my wife and I were going to stay with AT&T or switch, the only way to do it was to go the local AT&T store to transfer our lines to an account in my name. When I went there, they told me we weren’t allowed to keep the grandfathered data plan and would have to switch to unlimited. My wife and I use very little data, so I knew at that moment we’d have to switch carriers to get a fair price for the service we need. I set up autopay and paperless billing with AT&T before I left the store that day. 3 days later I ported our numbers to another carrier, and 2 days after that I received our final AT&T bill. I didn’t know until I received this bill that AT&T doesn’t prorate final bills. In addition to charging us an entire month for only 3 days of service, they also took away the $10 per line discount we should have received for setting up autopay and paperless because I canceled our service before the bill was generated. I tried multiple times on the phone and in online chat to make my case to customer service that we were unfairly overcharged. Even if I had conceded I was at fault for not knowing they don’t prorate, they at least should have reinstated the autopay discount when I explained our situation and the reason we canceled our service. Every representative I spoke to gave the same answer: there was nothing they could do unless I reactivated our service. Doing so would have made no sense because my wife and I aren’t big data users.I will absolutely never be an AT&T customer again. They showed no mercy to a grieving family and made us pay $160.32 on our way out the door for only 3 days of service on 2 lines.",0
"We bought our IPhone 11 at 2021 and iPhone 12 at 2022 with their service until may, 2023. We then switched to Consumer Cellular without contract till now. When we are planning a trip overseas, we found out both iPhones are sim locked by carrier. The problem is that we can not use local data SIM card service, which are much cheaper that AT&T international roaming services. So we contacted to Consumer Cellular to help us unlock our phones. Consumer cellular response to us, that iPhones were not bought from them we have to talk to At&t. AT&T online unlock device service don’t let we submit request in, because those phones current service by their reseller, ask us to call consumer cellular instead. We were spent three days, have been back and forth kick off forever. We are now locked to consumer cellular and forced to use their services forever and couldn’t use any other carrier companies service as we like to.",0
"Is there any way we could take them to court? what are  our options?  They obviously are going to continue their business counting on people not wanting to switch again.  They are just talking bs and pocketing the money.  They are not remotely attempting to do better! It is pathetic and completely wrong ethically! I couldnt even reach a restaurant to make reservations today..nothing,,,no beep,,,no connection...they should be ashamed",0
"Two sales reps. knock on the door and offered a better, cheaper, reliable internet service. So we signed, and set the appointment for Saturday morning. One week later they never arrived, never calls and when we call the service dept. they told us they do not have enough techs to install, so it must be moved to the end of the month. ....after one hour on the phone we just cancel it. ....Save yourself a headache they do not have enough employees to serve central Florida and that is the true as i was informed by their own people.....",0
"I was told the only way to remove my deceased husband's email and change the password he set up was to go into an AT&T store. What a joke, but I'm not laughing. The gentleman who helped me was very nice, but he didn't correct what I asked him to. AT&T plans to bill me by my deceased husband's email and account he set up. It will not work but you can bet I will receive a late charge again because the customer service can't or won't listen to their customers. Go out of business AT&T. You don't get it.",0
"I've been a AT&T customer for years.  When moving to an area where AT&T coverage is poor we changed carriers.  I cancelled my service in April of 2024, every month they continued to bill me.  Average call time on hold was an hour (one time 2 hours - I was being stubborn).  The bill in July was treated differently and AT&T claimed they'd never received my cancellation and had no record of previous conversations.  I guess the bill reversals was spontaneous kindness on their part?  When I called the final time it was clear it was a collection agency masking itself as AT&T.  There was extremely unprofessional behavior, shouting etc in the background.  I opted to pay the final bill which I did not owe because the constant calls were impacting my health.  I will never be an AT&T customer again and will ensure all my friends and family know they are criminals and are no longer the trusted corporation of the past.",0
"They were good for a while, until my bill got over $300/month. Granted it was for devices for 4 people, but when I found a better deal they wouldn’t release the devices to port out and I ended up having to port out one by one which cost $60 total that I didn’t account for. Bad business practice.",0
The customer service and support is dead on arrival. They are racist. They lie to take your money. And have no dignity when caught in lies. And when ask to speak to a manager NOBODY knows anything. Just kill the company! ALL the time TO ALL people !,0
"My internet service has now been out almost 2 days. They offered me $15 for the inconvenience. That may have worked in 2019. However, with most people working from home this is a major inconvenience and you offered $15. Internet isn’t the only service I can’t use right now. This is absolutely ridiculous. The reps suggestion was to use my mobile hotspot. Why should I have to if I paid for internet in my home.  He offered to get me a phone contract through AT&T. I assume the service is as bad as the internet service. Seriously thee worse experience and thee worse resolution. I have other service providers that can hook new service up quicker than you guys are fixing the issue.",0
Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. I tried them 7 years ago and left because of awful CS. Came back today and had my fiber plan approved and decided to back out because of the excruciatingly terrible service. If this company was a startup and not a monopoly it would never get off the ground.,0
I have been on the phone for over 2 hours today with nothing resolved.  We have a simple online logging in issue.  I asked to speak with a manager and they just put you on hold to transfer you and then drop the line.,0
"The worst experience in my life.I have been trying to talk to costumer services for 3 weeks and today I was on hold for 6 hours and right at one hour 1:39 minutes exactly they hang up on me.I decided to drive to the store, first one couldn’t help and the second one too.This is seriously ridiculousStay away from this company",0
Me and my father have tried to get a phone hooked up and The have continuously made it more difficult to hook up 1 Phone we had already set up a account with them for a new phone of mine. They then charged us for trying to activate said phone. When testing the phone to see if it worked; it would not work. Trying to work with them has been a big pain in the ass.,0
I asked the agent to cancel my watch line because the service never worked but I was being charged for it. I gave the specific number associated with the watch.Instead the agent cancelled my phone service.I had to cancel multiple business meetings and spend 2 hours being transferred from agent to agent as they didn't know or have the power to help get the number and line back.This is Still not resolved as I write this.,0
I have talked to 10 different people trying to transfer my landline back to a t & t.  I have to keep explaining over and over again.  It's been since the ending of July that I started this.  They are of no help.,0
"I’ve been using AT&T service for me and my wife for about a year and a half, bought there to phones. When I decided to switch to other connection provider, I wasn’t able to cancel the service, cause company has a tricky payment system - you’re paying not before starting to use their service. So my bill was published while I already using my unrestricted plans. So I’ve paid for a next month. Then sever times texted in chat and even called to a company call center to make sure about a date till what I need to cancel service. So by the end I was assured that all is done and I still have about a week of already paid period… 3 months later I got an email with additional fees ~ 145$ for some late payment and something like that! I got an autopay, few representatives assured me that there won’t be any additional fees, and now they Threaten me with a collector’s company!!! Poor service, won’t recommend it anyone and more than that I will ask to find other company, cause the level of client service below zero!!! Scammers, shame on you!!!",0
If I could I would give AT&T a -5 stars. We had trouble getting them to resolve an issue with our billing.  It took 7 months to get it fixed and then they didn’t want to correct the past 7 months that were billed incorrectly.  We had all the ticket numbers from each month they told us it would be fixed on the next billing cycle.   They are truly the worst phone company I have ever  worked with.  Version was so much better.  I should have stayed with them!,0
"I am relatively new to AT&T, but I regret signing up with the company. I have to consistently call in to resolve the same issues repeatedly. I am not sure if their associates lack competence or not. I am getting sick and tired of having to re-verify documents and calling in to find out why my bill is significantly higher than expected. So far, I am not having a good experience and praying that a new phone service emerges so I can switch. I definitely don't want to go back to T-Mobile. Fingers crossed for a new emerge. Insurance used to be $10/$12 now it’s $17 per line? No!",0
"ATT does not care for their customers at all, they LITERALLY ALLOWED SOME RANDOM PERSON ADD LINES TO MY ACCOUNT AND WHEN REPORTED AND I FILED A POLICE REPORT I WAS TOLD OH WELL WE CAN HELP YOU PAU $1,000 or WE SEND YOU TO COLLECTIONS!!!! I HAVE BEEN WITH THEM FOR NEARLY 18years AND THEY ARE SHOWING THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AT ALL!!!!!!",0
"I have had a cell phone for about 3 decades, originally with Unicell here in the Mad River Valley of Vermont, and then ATT bought that company. I used to get 3-4 bars of service at my house, and very spotty service or none in the Valley. A few years ago they started charging extra ""administrative"" fees, as they started rolling out 5G. Then I started getting only 1-2 bars at my house. Last year they increased the cost of my plan (unlimited talk/text + 4 GB data with some rollover) by $5. Last month they notified me that my plan will be going up by another $5. I researched and decided to change to a prepaid plan for $25/month, prepaid for a year. I tried to do that over the phone but after waiting on hold for a while, I was told I would have to call the prepaid phone number. I called that number and it turned out that number was only for dealing with an existing prepaid account. I tried calling the main number again. The wait time was about a half hour so I opted for the callback. Within a half minute of receiving the callback, the call dropped. I waited for another call but none came. I called the number again and this time the wait was about 1 1/2 HOURS. I called a nearby (40 minute drive) ATT store. Matthew said he could set that up but I had to make an appointment. He set that up for yesterday afternoon at 3:30. I arrived a minute early and found Matthew with a family trying to make up their minds, and he was the only employee there. I waited about 15 minutes and I had to not only tell him that I had an appointment but I had to tell him again why I was there. He asked for my driver's license, but I knew from previous experience that store employees demand that and copy it or enter all of that info into their system, even if you only want to buy a charging cable. I only use my passport ID card because it has less personal info to get hacked. After entering all of the info, he asked for the ID again and had to re-enter all info. He told me that I did not need a new SIM, but I showed him on my phone that I did, so he charged me another $5+ tax and installed one. That process took another half hour. I now have service again, but I will be waiting to see what comes next. In the fine print, ATT can change terms at any time, without notice. I have never had a good experience with ATT and I do not trust the company. The terms are very long and complex (yes, I try to read the fine print).",0
try calling customer service wait hours then they hang up. dont dare ask to lower bill they said yes my next bill was double then took for ever to fix it.use anyone else they are horrible.,0
"I bought a used iPhone 14 Pro and my purchase verified at a local AT&T store. It took me many hours online and at the AT&T store to get my phone working with AT&T. And, it was an AT&T locked phone. Very frustrating. Now, after a year of horrible reception, I would like to have my phone unlocked. I have called tech support or six times and spent literally three or four hours on the phone. Each time they say it will be unlocked within three days. Now, nearly 3 weeks later my phone is still . I guess I will either sell the phone or try again. For the life of me, I cannot understand how horrible the tech support people are AT&T.",0
"My bill just went up over 10 dollars. When I signed up with A T&T, i was told that 55 plus price would never change, just over 59 dollars a month at that time. Now they are charging me over 70 dollars a month. I purchase this at Sam's Club.  The Girl that signed me up told me the price will remain the same as long as I never cancel or change anything. I will be shopping around for an honest company.",0
"Could not get high speed saleman off my property going door to door. Call AT and T and they told me if he came back call police. He came back next day and police had to come to get him gone for good. Why would a company tell me to call police on one of there employees, they should of told him to leave and not to go back to this home. We have no trespassing signs up.",0
"We have AT&t fiber optics home internet. We have thoroughly enjoyed our internet services and the people who came out to install it were very helpful and kind. I logged on to view our bill and saw a deal for a new phone. Because we had such good success with our home internet we decided to switch our phone carriers, get two new phones on AT&t, and bundle our services to save us some money. We called customer service to have all of our questions answered and the man was very helpful. After answering all of our questions he asked us if we were ready to switch over and we said yes. He told us everything we needed to know about the deal and how it would all work out. He then took down all of our information on our previous phone that we were to trade in for this deal. He told us that since we were doing it over the phone he would put us in for a kit so that we could send our phones back in the mail. This was ideal for us as we have a new baby. After we completed our phone order we received our phones in the mail a few days later. We got everything actived, set up and switched over just fine. When our first bill came around it was exactly what he had told us it would be on the phone. We got our first bill after 15 days of service. I called customer service back because we still hadn't received our kit to mail our phones in to AT&t. The lady on the line said that they had sent them out and we just needed to wait and that they should be in our mailbox within the next couple days. After a couple of days still not had received the kit so I called AT&t back. This time the man on the phone said that the deal had expired and we were no longer eligible for it. I did not understand how this could be possible as we were still within our 30 day activation time. He was very unhelpful and very rude. The next day I called customer service again and spoke to another man. He told me that there was no order in the system for us. There was no order for our brand new phones and there was no order for the mailing kits so that we could send in our new phones. I asked him how this was possible as I had two new phones and I was now paying monthly credits for two new phones. After spending about an hour and a half on the phone with him and he was supposedly digging around our account trying to find out what was going on he told me he was sorry but there was nothing he could do because there was no record of anything. I went to our email account to try and find the order email and it is no longer available and I can no longer access any information about our order through the online app or by going through the desktop online. On my next day off of work I went into the AT&t store and spoke to the manager and explain to him all of this. He said that this was a very common issue that AT&t was dealing with when it came to processing online and phone orders. He said he was sorry but there was nothing he could do for us and we were just going to have to pay for the phones. I told him this was not acceptable and that they needed to figure out a way to rectify this situation because I did not switch to AT&t to buy two brand new phones. I could have done that with my old phone company. I am now in the process of trying to go back and speak to a different manager and if nobody can help me and they're sorry and we are just out of luck then I guess I'm going to have to give them their phone back and switch back to my old carrier. I never had any issues like this with my old carrier. Sticking with AT&t to save 20 bucks a month is not worth going through all of this. This has been a very stressful and disappointing event. We have a new baby and we were not expecting to have to pay for two brand new phones. While an extra $60 a month may not be much to some it is a lot for us. I was so looking forward to having the same great experience as we did with our internet. I'm so saddened by the lack of disregard and unhelpfulness I have received in this matter.",0

"If I could give a -5 star I would. This company has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Hung up on my call, didn't call back when the robot said they would. It took 2 days and a huge amount of wasted time. I have been a customer for 25 years. They misrepresented their products to me so we decided to go with another carrier. They have made it incredibly hard on me and my husband to transfer with a new number(we asked to keep our old numbers) because we are owners of a small company  & there are ALOT of business contacts not to mention personal contacts we have to sift through and make the change. AT&T would not. there is not one good reason for them to keep our old numbers. My number was also completely cleaned up, no robo calls, no spam!, and now I have to start all over! I recommend, first DO NOT go with AT&T at all! They are really much higher than most  all carriers. They are not user friendly at all. All the major carriers have sub carriers & they all use the same cell towers. Save yourself the money and down the road aggravation.",0

"On April 17, 2024 Geraldine Walsh went to the AT&T store at 10 Washington Street, Norwell, MA to get a new phone.  She gave her iPhone 12 PRO to the store manager as a trade-in for a new phone.  The amount for the iPhone (trade-in) was going to be $750 as quoted by the manager.  He did not give her a receipt as he said the credit would show up as a credit in her online bill.  When after 2 months Geraldine did not see the credit, she called the store.  That manager is now at a new store.  The current manager told her there was no ""record"" of her iPhone 12 Pro being given to the previous store manager as a trade-in.  She then called AT& T multiple times - and they also told her there was no record of her trading in her phone.  They did nothing to help.  Finally, ""Missy"" from AT &T said that it was up to Geraldine to prove that she gave the manager her phone and that she should file a police report. Geraldine has now filed a police report, and they are going to pull the stores camera.  That AT&T was so completely unhelpful is so awful.",0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I have been a loyal customer for decades. I had the UVerse bundle and called customer service because I was having computer disconnect, TV streaming would freeze and you would get kicked off of your tablet or phone multiple times daily. The AT&T customer service person told me he was going to get me set up with Spectrum because in my area AT&T cannot offer the bandwidth/speed I need for multiple people & devices. I asked the agent if I called AT&T or Spectrum and he said AT&T. So in Jan 24 I received the Spectrum router & modem. In Feb 24 I set up the spectrum account totally remotely and then sent the AT&T equipment back via UPS. I didn’t think anything of it and recently looked through my bank statement and found I have been getting charged $71/month from AT&T. Elsa, the supervisor I eventually spoke with because I felt they should refund every penny they have been taking since I returned their equipment told me:1. You didn’t call to disconnect service (what the hell is the return of equipment??? A continuation??)2. There is no way I could have had Spectrum set up remotely from my home, I would have had to have a Spectrum service person at my house….bullcrap, I still have the remote set up instructions they sent with the equipment next to my spectrum router.3. Even though they take the money directly from my checking account, they will send me a 1 month refund on a prepaid Visa….hmmmm, you had no problem taking it out, but you don’t wanna put it back4. And yeah, a 1 month refund because I didn’t ‘call to disconnect.’ I also didn’t call to get a Spectrum account, it was their employee who recommended it…. Sent back their freaking equipment and if they interrogate my wifi, they can see I have not used it in months. Just wanted service without so many disruptions.So dissatisfied on so many levels. I’m looking to change my cellphone service provider and I will never go back. AT&T stinks and they are not good faith actors.",0
"I want to share this in as many places as possible because of the terrible customer service and because of the unapproved charges I received from ATT while traveling. We were on a cruise and within a short period of time my daughter received the below messages then her phone was shut off.  I did not approve or agree to these charges. I didn’t ask for them to provide service on a cruise ship. Welcome to the awesomeness of ATT. What should have happened was that they should have asked me to confirm that I wanted this service provided. Instead they let it go and charged me for it. Sorry but that’s predatory. It’s like you’re taking advantage of a 14 year old kid and then their parents to make an extra buck. Meanwhile I have Verizon and no issues, no unapproved charges and no one feels taken advantage of. If you have issues good luck with that. The voice response unit is awful and wait time to speak to a human at up to one hour. This experience was terrible. My advice is go with Verizon because at least you know they won’t take advantage of you like this",0

Internet outages - I have had 226 outages since MIDNIGHT last night.  I run a network monitoring tool on my computer that pings 3 of the major internet domain name servers every 2 seconds.  When the monitor tells me it is offline I cannot connect my browser to the internet and my streaming TV picture locks up. This is a running problem for over 7 months.  I get so tired of their canned menu driven troubleshooting process - I have rebooted my router over 100 times to no avail.  They replaced it three times since last December but I still have issues. I bought a new computer to eliminate my equipment as the cause. I replaced all my ethernet wiring with cat 6e.  Still have this problem. No alternative available due to some agreement the neighborhood developer made with AT&T so they are the only provider allowed here. I cannot trust my connection to do medical or banking transactions - I am baffled....,0
"AT&T rewards John Stankey with his $24,500,000 salary notwithstanding that his recklessness has cost millions of loyal customers the privacy of their data.

"Multiple days / roughly 2+ hours per call per day attempting to resolve an AT&T created issue where an iPhone 15PRO upgrade purchased directly from AT&T, was activated under a new phone number not requested by the purchaser. The second existing phone number from an older iPhone 6s Plus that was being upgraded was added to the second E-Sim causing the iPhone 15PRO to have two phone numbers in it.  Purchaser request for cancelation of the non-requested number generated a bill for the full amount of the iPhone 15PRO that was originally purchased under an installment plan.  This sure seems like it was a 100% scam by AT&T, with an intention to mislead the purchaser into adding an additional line of service to an account or voiding the installment plan the iPhone 15PRO was purchased under in the advent this second line of service was delegated.AT&T Customer Service is unable to resolve, refuses to resolve or intentionally will disconnect calls related to this type of issue.",0
"They are, and continue to be the worst internet provider in the country. Don't waste your time. Go with Spectrum. I used to have them as a mobile carrier and internet. I was interested in having them install fiber... as usual they give you a block of 2 hours... of which they originally didn't come on the day scheduled. Then on the day it was rescheduled they were late... wasting my time, and having to push calls out. Their customer service is off shore and incompetent. When you call back hold times are close to an hour. Seriously... there is better products. What's sad is they are based in Dallas, and the service is still garbage here.",0

"Two phones on my account were traded in for new phones. I contacted ATT for the box & labels to return each phone. I followed the steps provided and mailed the two phones back to ATT. A month went by with no credits to my account. Another month went by so I called ATT. I was on hold for an hour. ATT rep stated it could take up to 3 months to see your credit. The credit for both phones is $1400. $700/per phone.I have called multiple times attempting to resolve this. ATT now says they never received either of my phones!! I visited my local ATT store and was told the mgr was going to escalate my issue- never heard back. I called ATT and asked for their trade in distribution center and the sales rep refused to transfer me and tried to upsell me something else. After 1hr30 min the rep hung up on me. Most recently I had a conversation with an ATT employee off the record and this employee stated that ATT had sent customers the incorrect label for trade ins.  The labels ATT sent customers for trade ins all went back to ATT sales. ATT says that they have no way of tracking either phone. I followed the directions with the correct box, label and timeframe to return these two phones. After having 6 calls with ATT, multiple chats & visiting the ATT local branch and getting nowhere I need to contact the Attorney General, BBB and leave reviews.

"Way too expensive not worth it .. what I pay for two lines is ridiculousl I have recently left AT&T … not only are they expensive when they had that quick outage they didn’t compensate anyone and if they did, it was for small amounts other than that they don’t do anything for you. They might give you a seven dollars off of $300 bill but what is that not my cup of tea",0
"AT&T internet in NW Ohio is a joke, I can't even use my phone on wifi. Cell service is very bad and now they sent me a email that price is going up. Guess I'm going to save some money because I'm canceling. Price goes up but service stays the same",0
"I liked the people who helped me and the people who introduced me to AT&T. They offered to help me with my business. For a business I think it's great! However, later while using their service they had outrageous charges  for service. I knew it was going to be a lot but not like what I received. I agreed to pay for the charges for months hoping each month it would get cheaper by using wifi. However I couldn't get a clear explanation as to why they were so high. I left the country and my mom was trying to help me and she went to close my account and said I was changing service providers and they still charged us service after that meeting. I just feel like they could have been helpful and make sure when she went in that it wouldn't charge me so she wouldn't hear about it while I am gone. Unfortunately not only was that charge unfortunate they couldn't explain why it was so high. My advice find CHEAPER SERVICE! What was in the contract was way less than what was actually charged 2x that much. Or don't get in a contract with them. BUY your apple phone and AirPods somewhere else!! The people were patient just lots of unanswered questions I feel like they say call corporate about the charges.",0
"This company has the worst ""support"" service for wireless I've ever encountered. Handed from one incompetent agent to the next, while having to explain the purpose of the request each time, ultimately led to being dumped back into a general call queue.

ZERO stars is the correct number.",0
"When it comes to cell phone plans. They will con you into getting deals and never hold up their end of the deal. So that lovely savings you thought you will get, non-existent!!! Also after our contract was up, We bounced to another carrier. Not only they shafted us with prorating us, they charged an additional month after we canceled our plans. So we paid for another month with non-existent service. The representative didn't even attempt to make it right. Denied us from speaking to a manager. Denied our refund. This is Straight Up Theft And Fraud!!!!",0
"The services really sucks i can't even connect to the app when i got 5G indicated in my screen and to top it up i am paying a lot for this and they won't even fix the issue i had for six months. I am constantly being charged for ""one time charge"" restoral fee that is not even my fault. I have talked to 5 or 6 agents that says the same thing that they can help with the issue and at the end all results are the same. They will waste the time chatting and ask tge same questions and instead of fixing the issues they will just go in circles and to end it with they could not help and the issue is with the other department and they are closed already and have to schedule but when you schedule a call back for the next day guess what? Nobody will call. I got all the chat scripts that i downloaded i got screen shots and screen recording of the 5G that can't even connect to the their app just to prove it whenever i need it. I constantly ask for support to have my issues resolve and i don't think something is being done. I don't care if i pay 160$ per month for a reasonable service but not like this. I checked all the bill i payed and there is a lot of restoral and one time payment that they charged me they charged me double on some bills. Somehow my fault coz i don't check it but now i checked everything and add all of it damn i payed more than i need to and they are robbing me in front of my face all the time.

They also charged me for a temporary phone (3 days at $60.50 + tax) to contact credit card companies, utility companies etc. (about 35 in total) that AT&T put at risk.  They are now having trouble reinstating the installment plan (and subsequent credit) for the remaining 14 month left on the installment plan.  I've been told by numerous people that the installment plan was reinstated and a credit issued when, in fact, that has not yet occurred (after multiple calls and more than 5 hours on the phone with them; currently I've been on a call for 2 hours and 23 minutes).  NO ONE at AT&T seems competent enough to resolve this issue.  They also don't seem to care that they caused me immeasurable problems and could very well have assisted the scammer in stealing my entire life savings.",0
Don’t do it.  Loyalty stands for nothing with this company.  The service is subpar.  I get kicked off the internet at home frequently.,0
"ATT phone plan is so hard to squeeze data out of it I can't even watch more than one video a month on my phone. 45 dollars a month should entitle me to more than one TV show. Dont pay the the NFL 15 a month without a Verizon unlimited data phone, ATT just can't handle it....",0
The fker att customer is sh… The retail and the customer all different. They all dodging around just to make you pay more and more…. Even if you are 10 yrs customers or 10 lines with them you are not getting anything as loyalty. Dont go to att,0
At&t sucks service is trash customer service is trash and there home internet us trash why start a company expand to make house internet to keep up with competition but you guys as a company can't even have a basic level of communication within your departments what's the point I can't even pay my bills together for home wifi and my cell phone fyi me and my money will be going somewhere where they can provide all the services I have to jump thru hoops just to pay on I will go to a company that has there communication and customer support as a priority vs an opinion....better service and price with a pay as u go phone from Walmart I am sad that I have anything to do with at&t more reviews on other platforms have a good day don't get at&t there's a reason there score is so low,0
I just switched phone service from Metro pcs to AT&T. I cannot believe that Metro Pcs service is better than AT&T I can’t use my phone half of the time because the service is bs.,0
After 4 years of service I had a suspension of service for a very small bill customer service was very rude and a matter of fact attitude and wouldn't even attempt to help me make payment arrangements after 4 years of service,0
"AT&T the worst customer service ever!!I went online, then on the phone then to an AT&T store. Three times in three days.I was told multiple times I was good to go. Only to find out someone messed up and my new phone is still not working. The last customer service representative spent over an hour with me. He said u can wait for the sim card to arrive in the mail or go to your local store and get one. So for the fourth time in three days I went to the store. Only to be told that I could not get one from the store even though they have plenty. I had to wait. Day 5 with no phoneThanks AT&T😞",0
I call unlock my phone but they're always try to push me to update and I said I don't want then they're try to delay and said my phone í have problems and can't unlock. There customers is bab and lie and want I pay for the next month,0
"This company had a policy of NOT pro-rating a bill if service is canceled mid billing cycle. If you're just ONE DAY into a billing period and cancel your service, you're on the hook for an ENTIRE MONTHS service. Additionally, once ypu cancel service and port your number, your access to your online account is suspended. Not a huge deal, UNLESS, you want to print out past bills or see your usage for the past billing period. The only way to see past usage is to contact the company and request paper copies of current,  and/or past bills. Which will cost you FIVE DOLLARS PER COPY. Something the customer rep DOES NOT DISCLOSE when you request said copies. We will NEVER return to this company. On principle alone.",0
They lie waste your time and overcharge.,0
"i have been with AT&T for 20 years. I went in to our local store to upgrade, I was shocked when my bill finally posted. I told the sales person in the store that I did not want the protection plan. It was on my bill along with the AT&T next up. I couldnt get through on the phone so I chatted with a rep. who said if its been under 2 weeks, I need to go back into the store. I did and local store said the protection plan and Next up are automatically added. To cancel you have to go online through the app. which still leaves me oweing the fees. I am furiuos. Not only did theyput the charges on my bill, the local salesperson never said anything about it to me.",0
The only reason I'm giving one star is because of the lady that tried to help me and got my internet working a little better. I reviewed them on the FCC And they reached out to me They scheduled a technician to come out They scheduled it for an account in Florida not my account so that was the first thing they got a guy to come out finally take a look at it that don't worry we're going to take care of it. The internet is working somewhat better but at the beginning of all this my bill was $40 and it should have been 30 only started charging me a late fee because I didn't pay that bill I said that wasn't my right amount now my bill is $180 and nobody will call me back I am having stressed out nightmares anxiety about this and all I said was I was leaving to go to another company and then tried to save my business The fact that they won't return a call or tell me what's going on I just don't know how they can continue to do this over and over. Like the 4th or fifth time that they haven't kept their word on something.,0
"I chatted with an agent to simply combine my two bills. I have one bill for my wireless account and another one for my home internet account. I requested to have the bills combined into one so that I don't have to pay two separate bills every month. This rep was so poorly trained that he did not even know he had cancelled my home internet altogether. I noticed my home internet not working during our char conversation and mentioned that to him, even tried to resonate with him. I said something like ""is there ay chance you accidentially cliccked something that could have caused my internet issue?"" He said no. Then he connected me to another rep who had me reset my gateway but service was still not restored. Then I got transferred to the third rep andfinally service was restored. Altogether I spent 3 hours chatting with AT&T all just to combine my two bills into one. Now my service is restored but God only knows if my accounts have been combined as I originally chatted with AT&T to accomplish. If I hadn't JUST cancelled with my previous home internet provider and paid early termination fees, I PROMISE I would cancel with AT&T. The gross negligence and complete lack of training is incredibly frustrating. This is NOT the first rep's fault. This is the first rep's manager's fault. The rep should be trained enough to at least recognize when he cancels a customer's service. It would be a cherry on top if he were trained to not cancel the service altogether. I'm Extremely dissatisfied with this interaction, so is my family since it occupied my time for 3 hours. Absolutely terrible interaction, AT&T.",0
I wish I had read this before I was trapped. Lie to about there plan price charged triple on the 1st bill. Then no one knows where the 1st quoted price came from. They will rip you a new one. Customer Service 🤣 No one knows what’s going on but can definitely get the bank account your payin from correct. Make sure you have enough in the bank to pay the extra if not you’ll never get out. Call Spectrum they got it together.,0
Yes I paid my bill August 2nd 2024 the company is saying I didn't the app said I did my account says I did I still say I don't if I don't pay it they won't shut me off well I got all the proof that I I need that I paid it off never had any problems with four separate now all of a sudden there's problems terrible service man terrible service,0
"I would give their customer service ZERO stars if it was an option, but it's not!When I call, every time, I am punching in verification codes, only to be asked the SAME information by the overseas employee once they finally pick up, and then they send me ANOTHER code to verify who I am. So, what exactly is the point of ME having a personal pin code if they simply send me ANOTHER pin code and waste my time??Then, I am always on the phone for at least 30 minutes, but usually an hour or more. AT&T used to have awesome customer service, but now, I know, when I call, it will be the worst ever.Right now, I've been on this current call for 35 minutes and 42 seconds AND I am only calling for a return label for a phone that has never been opened. Still in the shipping box. I am astounded they are still in business with this kind of service.",0
Aboustley horrible service they will lie straight to your face I was told by at&t repetitive that the phone I was getting was free for switching my and that I would not see a bill for 2 months now 2 months later I receive the guess wat they are charging me the phone and I did not receive my discount for having wifi already has been 6 months I continuously have to call because I am not receiving my discount to this day beware THER ARE LIAR'S I have herd from other people I am not the only one get everything in writing from day one they will rip you offP.M.,0
Horrible service. You’ll lose service at least once a day. Half the time the data doesn’t work. You get maybe 480p without buffer. Better off using a landline than this companies servers and towers.,0
"1. I placed an online order to trade in my existing iPhone 13 Pro Max and buy a new Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.2. The order succeeded and I received an email to pick it up at the store.3. I visited the store and the representative in Fremont, CA told me that the order was not accessible and that she needed to cancel the existing order and create a new one.4. We go ahead and cancel my online trade-in order and create a new order in the store.5. While creating the order, the representative never asked me if it was going to be a trade-in, which ideally she should have? Anyway, the order goes through after waiting for 30 minutes and I walk out with a new phone. I am assuming I will receive a FedEx label to send my existing phone to At&T.6. 20-25 days pass and I do not receive any label or email confirmation. I call in to customer support to inquire about the shipping label. The agent tells me the order was cancelled for some reason and that he has created a new trade in request so I can walk in at any time and return the device.7. I walk in after a week (I am a new dad) and the lady at the store tells me that she cannot accept it since I was 1 day late. Advises me to call the trade-in customer support to request for an extension.8. Sitting outside the store, I call in the trade-in customer support and they suggest that it's not doable and that I should reach out to AT&T customer support.9. I call in the customer support and they tell me to get in touch with trade-in customer support since they cannot extend it anymore.Being late by 1 day and not getting to trade in my $1000 iPhone turned into a horrible experience. In addition, they have added protection plans without permission increasing my bill by at least $30/month. I have talked to them to remove them but still no update.Not sure what's going on with AT&T but their service is turning into a nightmare. I will switch to another carrier along with my family and friends the moment I have paid off the phone.",0
"I’ve had AT&T 20 years. I had Singular which changed to them. 5 lines, family plan. My bill is always around $400 and when I have a couple phones being paid for it’s close to $500. I can never get a break or a reason why I pay double what my friends pay. Finally changing networks after 2 decades and I’m buying a home with a house pmt of $500. See ya AT&T! It was so fun giving you $6k a year. 🦶",0
"Telephone customer service is nonexistent. Multiple times I've waited on the phone, and finally left my phone number for a return call, but that call never came. Right now researching an alternate carrier.",0
"They lie. If they are speaking, they are lying. All 4 phones 'died' at the same time, a couple of months before being paid off. I took mine to 2 separate stores and they said they couldn't help. One said, ""I can sell you a new one."" ummmm...no",0
"Worst customer service experience ever! Was told one price then the bill is a lot higher.  Call them back and you’ll be on hold for 30 minutes, no matter the time of day “due to high volume”.  Reading other customer reviews, how is this company still in business?  Unless you like to be repeatedly lied to, you better find another company to deal with.",0
"Is there an option for no stars? I call to ask a question about a baseball broadcast, why the team I follow isn’t in the same channel. Pretty simple.I go to the site that says 24/7 service to go through the prompts to be told it’s after office hours.I find that misleading and am amazed a company of this size doesn’t have 24/7 service.",0
"Worst customer service. Read all reviews below. They are accurate. I experienced similar experiences: they lie, no way to complain, spent hours on the phone trying to fix over charges, still they dont fix it, they advertise a plan at a price, it's another one...they lie.bad, really bad.",0
I fell for their trick twice. When I’ve gone to the AT&T store and bought a new phone I buy their offer for about $35 so that every time my screen protector needs changing I go in and they change it for eight dollars. That is until they decide to start doing away with the screen protectors and this happens at about two years kind of forcing you into buying your own screen protectors or buying another phone. The $35 offer is a scam as they don’t always have screen protectors that are “covered”. I am so done with AT&T . And whatever you DON’T BUNDLE! This one is their biggest scam!,0
"Switching from Verizon to at&t was one of the worst decision I made.  They have zero respect for their customers and they are liars.  Any call I make to my husband from the house to the garage (on our property) is ALWAYS choppy or gets lost.  I think they make no effort to better themselves because they don't care.  I should never have had someone come into my house while I was having another at&t repairman there.  I do not like the way they do this and only switched because the rep made promises I had to fight to obtain fully.  They are awful!!! The phone connection sucks and when I asked about fiber optic, they said it was coming to my area within a few weeks...I found out they lied about that!! I will make sure I switch to another company.",0
"You will be lied to consistently, by everyone.  This company will scam you into thinking you are getting a good deal and lie on the phone and do nothing to recover what you were promised.  Get everything in writing otherwise you are screwed.",0
Just found out the company is stealing money from me. I started keeping track of my phone payments when includes a 50 dollar phone install.ent payment because I suspected they weren't deducting it like they should have been. Come to find out I was correct and when I brought this issue to them they told me I was wrong and they were right even though I had documentation to prove it.,0
"Recently, I moved all my 4 iphones to a new carrier and thought that was the end of my association with AT&T. However, I came to find out that I had been carrying an extra iphone number since 2022 when my granddaughter went to the AT&T store and purchased a new iphone because her old phone had broken. Apparently, they had erroneously given her a new number (which she did not need since she kept her old number).  Consequently, they kept billing me for this number for an extra 2 months after my preceived departure from them and since I was on autopay and never looked, I did not realize this until I got the bill.  I brought this to AT&T's attention that I had been carrying this number since 2022 and argued that it was their fault and since there had been zero data and zero phone activity on this number, that they should reimburse me for the two months and also the 2 years of carrying this fictitious number and thus, end my business with them. They refused, even though I had been a loyal customer with them for close to 20 years. Greedy, calloused and worse company ever with no heart and zero customer loyalty.",0
At&t has the absolute worst customer service on earth there automated system is the worst on earth they need to go back to hiring real people because they system sucks I would give them a minus zero if it was available. I will be switching my services,0
AT&T wireless is the worse they make tons of promises to you and they don’t deliver the worst mistake in the world that I ever made was switching my phone service to AT&T wireless don’t get them,0
I just paid almost 360.00 for my bill and they’re still not letting me activate my line,0
ATT Service sucks sooooo bad.Can't believe how complicated it is to simple get logins for online account.CEO should be fired.,0
The company was hacked in April 2024. My personal data was exposed. I have been receiving quite a high number of phone calls and phishing emails. I have called AT&T and they say that my data is in tact yet a monitoring service I have has a data breach for my number and email. AT&T has refused to provide any support.,0
Went to the Germantown MD store to get help unlocking my phone to transfer to another carrier. They did nothing to help me except for me to go  to a site and put in unlock code which denied the unlock request.  The worker then walked away and started to change channels on a TV. I asked is that all? he said yes but didn't tell me anything. How rude to treat customers. That is one reason I decide to leave AT&T.  I just hope the manager does something about the poor customer service there.,0
"Broken promises and poor service! Black Friday ""deal"" has turned out to be a nightmare. I got charged $700 and more for the first 3 months because they claim they couldn't find my trade in phones! I have auto-pay and they didn't care or work with me. What if I didn't have the funds to cover the bill? AT&T is strictly about money and I will be leaving ASAP.",0
On hold waiting on tech support for 20 minutes and counting. I have never had a full day where there is no prolonged interruption to my internet. Same thing happened the whole time I had my phone service with them. The worst part is finally getting a tech on phone who keeps arguing that there is nothing showing on their end. So ridiculous. I hate this service.I used to work as a customer service agent and try to empathize with the tech support agents knowing that its technically not their fault if the service is terrible but WTH. And the monthly charges are highway robbery to top it off. I am definitely switching services. Good riddance.,0
"Absolutely the worst experience. I signed up for a phone and change of provider at an independent retailer, planned to turn mine in. Said I didnt want a contract, but then agreed to an 18 month plan.  Then when they sent me the wrong phone I went in to a store.  They gave me the wrong contract and I said no thanks, switch me to a prepaid. They didnt do that, sent me a bill 3 times what I was used to.Impossible to reach. forget a quick call to fix any issues.",0
"representative Prince promised to come back and help set up our equipment when it arrived. After several days of trying to get him to fulfill his promise , I have came to realize he has no integrity. After speaking to att support it is clear to me , they dont care..I do not recommend anybody to use att..they are a joke.",0
"At$t got me to sign up with a family plan for 135/month. 4 months later and have only had 1 bill at that price. Also came in last month without warning and took 799.00. Promised a refund in 30 days and now at 33 days have not seen the refund. Coverage, customer service, data all poor in central Oregon.  Do not buy from them.",0
A door to door sales rep sold me on the promise of a much cheaper monthly rate than our current carrier. We’d be saving $55/mo — turns out she gave me “misinformation” (as ATT put it) but there was nothing they could do to help. Currently paying more than before but I will be cancelling my wireless with them. Bait & switch lies. And now they get to keep my activation fees ($80).,0
Charged me $159 for something that never happened- an install of a router in a separate room. I called and they told me it would be refunded and it never was. Called back and they said they'd refund it this time. I have no idea if it will be.,0
Recently had a conv w at&t chat on trade in credits. At&t is not truthful and upfront about how the trade-in credits work. Also fail to mention that if you pay off phone early you will lose any remaining credits from trade in. And will not receive the full trade in amount. The idea of trading in a phone and having a number put on it and then stretching said amount out over 3 years is f’n stupid. Shopping new service. AT&T can take their service and shove it up their ass. Long time customer. No more.,0
I was basically scammed to switch to att in target. Now 1 year later the service in my area is so bad I have none in my house. Screw att I hope you go out of business. Then your call centers in India can’t even help us. I’m also a veteran and I would never recommend this to my worst enemy.,0
Just more useless gouging thieves I paid my bill on July first and they shut my phone off on the 25th .  Ripping me off that's all it's about and get away with it. They Don't deserve your money.  DO NOT USE THE AUTO PAY !!!  that's how they get away with doing that.,0
"I don't know why I'm surprised at the 1.3 ⭐ rating. And you wouldn't think it would be so low being such a big company. But the bumbling customer service is what I've experienced ever since signing up in December 2023. Not only are they outrageously priced as I had Metro prior but had to change carriers as I relocated to a remote area. With Metro I was paying 150.00 a month for 4 lines AND Internet. Never was charged a penny more. AT&T however is all over the board with different charges each month. It's never the same. I remember I had AT&T years back and that's why I left them and nothing's changed. Only the customer service has gotten worse because they're not organized. Every time I call in I feel a sense of dread because I know it's going to go wrong. I don't think that this company should be as big as they are. If they can't even handle customer service aspects, that should be easy. I have their internet service as well and every time I call in about it for some reason or another they can never find my account. I'm put on hold consistently and generally transferred to at least 3 to five people before they can finally figure out the issue if they can. They don't have a problem taking my money at the time the bill is due but whenever I call in they can never find my account no matter how many times I've called and been on hold for up to an hour at a time. It's beyond ridiculous And I don't know how a company can survive being so inadequate. I really just want to leave AT&T because of the customer service but of course they've locked me into something or other. This company is horrible",0
"I recently switched to a t and t fiber and wireless. The representative for the fiber is absolutely phenomenal. No problems whatsoever the Representatives for the wireless phone is a totally different story. The only thing they are concerned with is the dollar bill. I was specifically told by both gentlemen Joseph and Ralston, That my first bill would not be no more then $90 When I got the bill, I contacted both of these gentlemen, only to be giving a story of well this and that. I told them I was lied to and I do not appreciate it. Joseph asked me to give him twenty four hours to get the account straightened. Four days later, I have not heard from him.So I sent him a text asking him what the resolution was. To this very second I still have not gotten any resolution from either rep. Like I said, they are only concerned with the dollar bill, not taking care of the customer. I also stated I did not want automatic payments and not to put it on a particular credit card that I put the phone deposit on. When my first bill came in, it was an automatic deduction on the credit card.I told him not to use. These in home, wireless reps are absolutely noteworthless and do not care about their paying customers. I will be keeping my fiber internet But I will definitely be changing cell phone services.",0
At&t suck at helping the military. My son going in the military and they want put him on a line suspended his line while in basic training.  They want let you go into a store and show paperwork.  They want you go online and when told that didn't have a way to scan documents they said go online again.  Not all older generations know how to do those things or even have internet.  They said not their problem.  They have terrible customers service. They basically said for me to suck it.,0
"This company att&t can not improve because I have already proved that scenario and yes I did call and guess what they could not help me, me and my wife was lied to also about our monthly phone bill and it never stayed the price quote the they gave plus it went from 110 to 120 to130 to 140 to150 to 160 and last of all 170. This is not good service it's called corporate greed. And when I did call this is what they said is that the only way they can lower my bill is to take the auto pay and that will lower our bill 20 dollars, now if this isn't corporate greed then then nothing is att are crooks and the public needs to not do buissness with greed and robbery, all it is is political theft and as far as I'm concerned, as my father told me (  there's nothing worse then a thief and a lier ant att fits both bills",0
For one week we didn’t have internet service we called them the The schedule it no one shows up not even a call to cancel three times i don’t understand have this company still in business,0
The worst scamming company ever. Sold us 2 cheap phones for $120 whilst in America that did not work. When we asked for our money back after 24 hours they refused.,0
They are the most dishonest and cheating company ever. They lie about product and service. Tell you the truth straight talk is better and cheaper. The way the economy is They will try to cheat you no one needs that. So before you do don't. Don't believe them. If so I'm sorry for your lost of money.,0
"I have been an AT&T customer for 25 years or so.I have finally reached the end of the line with them. The wireless network speeds have really taken a nosedive in the areas where i work and live. I have compared my speeds with coworkers with same model phones their through puts was 300-400bps and mine was 80-100. ATT store said normal for this area. Wife gets new I-watch with cell data. We go to add watch data plan to our acct and they said there is a hold on our acct. We are delinquent on $1,500. I said impossible never have been and the balance due on acct was $0. They said i have to go through fraud dept and get a police report and prove it is not mine. Next day check my credit I have a default and is in collections. I have never received any notice from ATT or a collection agency. So, 25 yrs of being a customer and an acct that has never been late on a payment has to prove that it is not my debt. Because ATT did not do its due diligence in protecting my account and confirming the identity of a person making a fraudulent purchase on my account. I will be changing from ATT. Their blatant disregard for their customer will cost them more than they are saying I owe them. At $500/month it is there loss. So steer away from ATT would be my suggestion my friend. Sorry to get long winded.Signed Aggravated & Frustrated.",0
"Customer service sucks beyond belief. First, they don't post the information I need to obtain a PIN to tranfer service. They pretend to, but the information posted says to click a link that DOESN'T EXIST. Then, they hung up on me my first call and never answered my second call. 35 minutes on hold to get nothing done is unacceptable.",0
Please stay away from att. We've been with them for years and decided to do the phone upgrade. We'll they have a program that if you trade in old phones it will take off some from the new so we did 2 phones. We'll it been taking off for 1 phone but not the other. So when we seen it was not pulling the money off and did the math it about $300 so far that had not came off. We contacted them a d they seen the problem and tried to use everything they could to not credit my account. So we are getting a new provider. Fu k them and so now they say we see the issue but only can give $100 but not the $ 300. They can just send me my old phone that was in perfect shape back. Please stay away from these lieing thieves.,0
At&t has to be the most garbage phone service out of all them. I never have service anywhere. I'm a truck driver and I can't play my game on the network because it don't work nowhere it lies and says it's 5g but only cover 10% of the country sorry ass service but have the nerve to charge an arm and leg for service. Metro PCS has better service than this sorry ass service I'm switching back to tmobile at least they work mostly everywhere I go. I'm always dropping calls or losing signal everyday even in major cities. I don't recommend them for anything,0
Worst home Inet service ! Do not subscribe,0
"It is difficult to distinguish AT&T from typical scammers. They use the same tactics. Their representatives flat out lie. They create a problem, then it takes hours to resolve. Their reps seem to have a goal to take as much of our time as possible. They ask the same questions repeatedly. They ooze fake empathy and politeness to an astronomically kafkaesqe level. This has always been a horrible company. From the time when they rented Princess Phones till now. Yuk!",0
We have been loyal customers for over 5 years my husband’s name is on the account and passed away 5 months ago since that time I have tried to get his line shut off to no avail from them telling me the passcode is incorrect when in fact it wasnt to giving me a fictional number stating that this was the CEOs number. i cant even get a bill as to when the bill is do as they wont switch it over what POS company this is and of course lets not forget their data leak to the dark web,0
"Prepaid account support is bad. I had a trip to Europe and was advised by att support to add travel add-on for the countries that ended up not covered at all.I specifically asked for data coverage in those countries and once I got there I had no service or data at all. After spending 2 hours trying to get a refund, I was told mby one of the representatives that their system doesn’t allow refunds ! Then why spend 2 hours looking into this issue then?? Just wanted to let everyone know that their roaming data is not reliable and too expensive, just get local eSIM cards or portable WiFi devices instead when traveling abroad.",0
The worst possible customer service I have ever experienced.  They didn't even try to help me,0

"If it were possible to give ZERO stars I would. I have been with AT&T for over 17 years, all of my systems run through AT&T including every phone in my house, internet, cable, camera's, gaming systems, computers etc. EVERYTHING. However, that matters NOT to them. I am one tiny customer in the grand scheme of things and will not hurt their money in the slightest therefore they don't feel it necessary to do right. I have never asked for ANYTHING from AT&T. This 1 time after 17 years I don't have service at my job which requires me to use my cell phone. All my calls keep dropping on clients. I asked them about a booster. I was told by a rep that I would not be charged for the device. Then I get transferred to the person who can set that up and mail that out to me. This person then tells me it's $299. When I tell him what I was told, he transferred me to the Loyalty department. This lady told me they would listen to the call and if that was what was said to me they would mail it out to me but to give them 5 business days to do so (I told them it was the last 3 sentences at the end of the call - exactly where to listen at the exact moment it was said). I call today and they tell me they determined I was not told it would be at no charge which is a complete LIE! I was planning on paying originally.. then I was happy to hear it would be for free (without even asking!) so why the heck would I make that up?? At this point it's principle to be promised 1 thing when $299 is not even pennies to this company! I am changing to Verizon TODAY because that provider have service at my job and they refuse to do the right thing. Unbelievable!",0
"recently received notice my wireless bill will increase by 20.00 (note 20 year ATT customer)  when i called to inquire i was told they no longer offer the plan i was grandfathered into but i could switch to another plan for less with paperless billing and auto pay i explained i am not comfortable with auto pay to a company who has been breeched more than once.  i was basically told ""oh well""  you would think that ATT with be more considerate of their long-term customers as a result i will be canceling my account by years end.  once again ATT puts profit over customers",0
"So I learned a lesson. Yes, you will get a $5/month latest iPhone BUT AT&T owns you. You will NEVER own your phone meaning if you travel you can’t put a eSIM card in your phone unless you have fully paid for the phone. You think that’s reasonable? Not quite. Once your phone is paid for, AT&T must unlock the phone you fully paid for. You think that’s easy? Not at all. You will call their customer service and you’ll spend at least 30 minutes on the phone to someone who will tell you to do take all these steps and take zero responsibilities when it doesn’t work. So buy your phone with Apple, it’s more monthly but the phone is immediately unlocked, you actually own what you pay for.",0
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service!! Extremely disappointed with AT&T, and  we have loyal ties to this company that go back decades. When the high speed internet fiber optics became available in our neighborhood we switched. Big mistake.We will be without internet for more than a week by the time someone will get here to repair the problem. We keep receiving calls that postpone the repair. I realize these are first world issues, but we were told that they would come right out if we ever had problems with our service when we signed up with them. Sadly, not true.",0
This companies customer service SUCKS!!!!!!!!1 hour to renew my subscription what In the natural F*%k,0
Telling a customer you will not attempt to fix the problem without billing you is outrageous.  Having to spend 5 hours on the phone trying to speak to anyone who can help you is just silly.  Having to spend hours to even cancel account...,0
I’ve been an AT&T customer for over 50 years. NO MORE. Thanks to AT&T my social security number is all over the dark web. When are giants like AT&T going to start caring about their customers’ privacy. They are just shrugging off their incompetence and couldn’t care less about the injuries they are inflicting on tens of millions of hard working Americans who trusted them to protect the data they forced us to provide. Yet John Stankey is still the CEO of AT&T and is still “earning” a whopping $24.5 million dollars a year as a bonus for spitting on us. Why is Congress investigating everyone except for the real perpetrators of crime on Americans? I’ll tell you why - it’s called campaign contributions. And how is AT&T compensating us for its criminal negligence in gifting my personal data to thugs? They just raised my rate by $300 a year. SCREW JOHN STANKEY -just like he did to me.,0
"When I tell you, I’m extremely upset and frustrated when it comes to AT&T and a customer service center versus the AT&T stores or headquarters where you purchase merchandise I’m extremely upset that they do not be on the same page when it comes to customer service versus a AT&T store I’m extremely upset because of the advertising that the store representatives give you in order to purchase a new phone or tablet or etc.. I’m extremely upset that the information That was Gave to me about upgrading my daughter iPhone 11 was completely wrong and fast advertised to me in order to get the upgrade. This how it happened my phone was glitching really bad so I called to get it fixed. They told me she had an upgrade on that Pacific phone and line number in order for me to get the upgrade. I will have to pay the sales tax which was fine which so I paid the sales tax, they told me after I paid the sales tax. The phone was out of stock so I had to wait 7 to 10 business days to get that 60 something back and that I could go to one of the AT&T sites to purchase the phone inside of the store so I proceeded to do that  to the store the representative customer service agent at the store told me again. I see some information about a upgrade that you qualify for and I said yes my daughter phone is glitching. I wanted to get it fixed to keep it, but they said she had an upgrade for this Pacific line and Phone , he said yes that’s correct. She can get the iPhone 15 Pro. You just have to pay the sales tax so I’m like again, but I haven’t been refunded the sales tax that I just paid to come here to get the phone so so I paid again got the phone. He helped me  with transferring all her information pictures etc. so then he hit me with since you got this phone. You qualify for an iPad generation or you have to do today is pay the sales tax in order to receive it and pay off overtime on installments. just like the iPhone 15 so I paid I believe 60 something again for the sales tax he said the iPhone 15 installments I believe $15 monthly and the iPad is $34 monthly including the monthly bills so he said only thing you should see on your bill is 45 more dollars On your bill cycle, we waive the activation fee, etc. so so I asked again are you sure this the only thing I’m going to see when my bill come y’all advertise me before that’s how I open these lines a couple years ago due to advertising and he said I’m sorry you experienced that ma’am but yes, I’m sure I said OK. Let’s wrap things up, so he help me set up the iPad generation Connecting all my information on it from my phone, which I appreciated that so I left the store about a month later, I got the bill when I tell you my bill was ridiculous. Had all these fees a couple $80 fees each a couple activation fees might be it was like possibly $250 more than what it normally be so I called to ask what is all of this about what is going on why is all these fees on my bill Triple time this doesn’t make sense is what I told the representative so he tried to make it make sense to Why These fees and these larger amounts is on there, but it still don’t add up and it still don’t make sense And y’all still falsely advertising again to get To get the upgrade and the iPad so I still end up paying the $250 on my bill making my bill 600 and something dollars which I still feel like I need my money back because I was overly charged heavily And come to find out they added another line to my bill without my knowledge so is that not advertising where did the other line come from and how did it get here? So I called AT&T instead of going in the store. The agent on the phone told me I had another line opened when I got the upgrade in order for me to get the upgrade. I had to open up a new line. My mouth dropped wide open like what do you mean I opened the new line? I didn’t consent to open a new line. I wasn’t even told that in order for me to get the upgrade. I had to open a new line. I was told that the iPhone 11 already had an upgrade on it to receive, so that’s what I initially did and was told I did so once again where did this line come from and why was I lied to in order for you to make profit so now I’m stuck with this line that I didn’t ask about to receive and how did my upgrade on the phone that I already have that’s already connected to service become A whole new line and in order for y’all to try to fix it y’all continue to lie and try to make it make sense to why it happened. That way there’s no reason it should’ve happened that way there’s no reason told me in order for me to get upgrade, I had to open a new line, no reason there’s no reason I wasn’t told that if y’all would’ve told me that to give me the option to weigh out myself, maybe I would’ve proceeded but y’all didn’t give me that option. Y’all lied to me and Falsely advertised me for the second time And hear my bill still coming in overly heavy and overly charging All because of knowledge I didn’t receive to weigh my options Highly upset Law",0
Thanks for the data breach and the prices that keep going up! I can’t wait to switch providers.,0
"I had no option for zero stars so they got one. I have been with AT&T 30 yrs and never switched. In Jan. I brought my business number over from comcast landline to att cellular. I’ve had this number for 35 years and is the only number for my business. They managed to set my account up totally wrong. I thought the payments were set up on autopay with my 5 other personal lines. Well it wasn’t and the account never received a payment. Then they shut service off in May. I received a collection bill in June. I never received a paper statement, email, text or phone call tellin me my account was in arrears. I didn’t realize service was shut out ff because 100% of my phone calls were forwarded to my personal line. After I paid the bill they told me to go into a store and activate my account. Well they gave my number away to some data plan. I asked if I could get my 30 yr old business number back and they said they can’t but offered me a $200 credit to activate a new line.",0
"Bad service, I called and they put hold for 2 hrs , man this is sad I switched from Verizon, they also lied and told me free international calls then charged me 700$ ,",0
"All I’m going to say is save your time save your stress save your energy and go with something, someone other than att lost $2000 worth of promotion discount and my iphone that I traded in. They said lost in mail or said I never sent it. Going with a prepaid small company would be 1000 times better. Horrible company. Get bough by someone else and fix yourself",0
"No wonder they have a 1.3 stars, it seems like they don’t care at all",0
I have been with AT&T for cell service for 2 years and I was told that if I upgraded my 5 phones I would get $700 as a trade in value but after we sent them in we only got $165.  Now my Sales Executive Customer Success Mobility person and his boss are not responding to me.  I have also asked about other charges on my bill and again no response.  I would never recommend using AT&T and will be switching from AT&T as soon as possible unless somebody at AT&T makes this situation right.,0
They had been charging me a year after i canceled my service. Please be careful with this service provider. they don't care and just take your money for nothing,0
"I have had an incredibly frustrating experience with my current cell phone provider. First, the sales representative misled me by saying that if I got two iPhone 14 Pro Maxes, I would get two additional iPhones for free for my kids. I was also switching from a different provider, and he assured me that my bill would only be $165. When I asked about settling my bill with the previous provider, he said not to worry and that they would handle it.For the first three months, everything seemed fine. However, I eventually noticed my bill had increased to $220. When I called customer service, they informed me that the previous lower amount was part of a promotion and that my regular payments for the Pro Max were now due. I begrudgingly accepted this.The situation worsened when I needed to travel. I inquired about unlocking my phone to receive business calls abroad and was told it would cost $10 per day. Despite paying this fee, the service was terrible and I continued to be charged.Two days ago, I received a call from a collections agency regarding an unpaid balance for the phones from my previous provider. I was under the impression that AT&T had taken care of this, but they explained how it actually works.I went online and noticed that I am being charged for 4 phones. When I called customer service, they informed me that they would only give me a $6 credit for each phone they received from us as a trade-in. Now, not only do I have to pay my previous cell provider $1,300, but I am also essentially paying for the phones all over again without any clear explanation from AT&T.",0
"Worst experience ever with a cell phone provider. Employees use boiler room con artist tactics including flat out lying to confuse senior citizens and sell them all kinds of garbage they don't need. Was there almost 6 hours, 4 of those spent with a new guy who didn't know what he was doing. We were sold DirecTV and internet and told we would have fiber optic cable service and didn't. We found out when the technician came to hook it up and told us it wasn't available in our apartment building. We were sold a 3rd phone which we didn't need and told it would save us money on insurance. The 3rd phone costs $64 per month and insurance is $30. Went back 2 weeks later and was told by the manager that the 2 guys who sold us everything had been let go and that there was nothing she could do to help us. Went back again because neither of us could make calls or send messages and the female manager who refused to help us and the 2 guys she said had been let go were all there. She was very nasty until she saw that I was recording the conversation. She then showed me how to resolve the issue. Went in again today to return the unwanted 3rd phone and was met by ""David, just David"" who grabbed my phone from the table and tried to turn the recording off. He said they don't allow recording in the store in spite of several cameras in full view. He refused to help me at all and asked me to leave. In summary the manager and the other 2 employees have no respect for seniors and take advantage of them as much as possible.",0
"I've been with At&t for over 15 years, my dad worked for them for almost 50 and I'm done! I feel scammed! I traded a paid for phone to them and now I'm stuck with a phone for 3 years! The non speaking English agent lied and said it was an even trade. I should own this phone! I'll never trust them again!",0
Bill keeps going up every month for no apparent reason- same usage!Junk fees keeps getting tacked on and getting hold of customer service has become very difficult.Their customer support is in the Philippines and you get the runaround.The representative gives you a plan and minutes later he says he couldn’t do it,0
"A list of issues with AT&T over the last 3 months, on a business account, across phone and 3 different in-person stores for service:- Added a new line when I ordered a replacement for a lost tablet rather than activating on the existing line.- Incorrectly added permissions for an account admin that limited access, requiring 3 separate phone calls to resolve.- Wouldn't cancel the line that was added incorrectly initially, requirig multiple phone calls and a store visit to reverse despite it very obviously being an AT&T mistake.- When adding 6 new tablets, would not add them over the phone. The in-store associate added them to a higher cost data plan and added insurance without permission, resulting in $270/month in extra charges if it hadn't been caught within a couple days.- Completely unable to upgrade devices, change plans, or update devices via the web portal, necessitating long phone calls with unhelpful reps or in-store visits where the reps try to scam you.in all, I've probably wasted 6-8 hours of time on activities that I should have been able to accomplish in 30 minutes via the web portal AND they tried to scam us for additional data/insurance fees.",0
"Only giving 1 star because I can’t give less. If you are older, or have older friends and family, I would highly recommend going with a service other than AT&T. My story is too long to tell in dealing with AT&T on behalf of an elderly family member, but to say the very least they took advantage of her on a fraudulent level. Please, please do your research and find a company you feel confident will take care of their customers.",0
"Absolute worst customer service! They are rude, cut you off while you're speaking and seem bothered that you're asking them to do their job. We have an issue getting numbers ported over and I was transferred back and forth between departments for over an hour! One woman answers, mumbles and talks over me and then transferred me back to the mainline. Once I get everything squared away I will never come back to AT&T. Also, let's not forget everyone's personal information being leaked on the dark web. You would think they would be working hard to retain customers.",0
"I am a business owner with multiple phones and Tablets and have been an AT&T customer for over 10 years.My complaint:Extremely hard to get any type of knowledgeable help to resolve billing issues.  Have made multiple calls over several days resulting in excessive hold times, calls misrouted, calls being disconnected while speaking to an agent, etc.  My experiences with this service provider over the last couple of years has been nothing short of a huge disappointment filled with regrets.",0
They service sucks and the people that work for this company!!!!! They are a rip off!!! They over charge for 💩 And double your bill!!!! Worst company service I ever delt with!!!! I recommend nobody switch to their company!!!!,0
"Absolute worst service and customer service I've ever received. They lie and steal. Never, ever use ATT. They lied to me about the service I would be able to get, messed up connecting my new devices. Customer service lines were absolutely dreadful. No one stateside to speak to and everyone else either couldn't understand me or I couldn't understand them. They wouldn't accept my proof of CNA to get discount. When I finally had enough a couple days in I was forced to call tmobile and get my service back with them. Still dealt with issues with ATT . I sent them back their phones and they tried to steal them and charge me $2200 for phones I gave them back. Called to resolve that issue and found they literally had my phones there in the warehouse that I had sent back to them but yet they still charged me?! Overdraft my account and I had to lock my bank account because they charged me all this 2 months after I had returned the phones. They offered no compensation, no fix for all my time wasted and all the lies. Just told me the charge would be reversed. Disgusting practices. Absolutely criminal. Do not use ATT",0
"AT&T line has been out at our condo building for 11 days. Our entry system and fire alarm work with this line. During the last 2 days I have been on the phone for 6 hours trying to get some help. It seems like I have spoken to half the folks in India. Twice during the process, I was promised a time when a tech would visit. Both times no one showed up. We are at risk here with the fire alarm inoperable but no one at AT&T cares, even under threat of legal acton.",0
If I could give them a zero I would!! I am 13 days behind on my bill. I don't have a pass due balance. They shut me off. They refuse to work with me. In two days I was able to pay them. They refused a payment arrangement and to turn my phone back on. They are worst then comcast!!!,0
I shut off my service. Transferred two of four numbers and paid off my contract.The store did not tell me I had to contact the “loyalty” dept. To shut off the other two numbers.They also did not give me guidance on how to unlock the phone. I had to purchase another phone and they pulled 200 more out of my account.Said I had to pay 98.00 for two lines unusedI told them that I had an 800 credit score. That wasn’t going to take me out.But they said I could have went on vacation for a month and not used the phone. 🙄,0
I went into att to switch carriers. I had to put my information in 3 different times each time requiring a verification with their fraud department. The first time the fraud department said I did not have to give a deposit I said ok then they said I had to do the process over again. The fraud department then said I had to put down $1000 I said fine. Then they said I had to do the process over again which made no sense. The third time I had to go through the fraud department again which said I had to put down a 3000 deposit for two phones costing 1400. I was not going to pay 3000 for phones. We went through the entire process and when I agreed they said we had to do it again three times in a row going from no deposit to 1000 deposit then 3000 deposit. It made absolutely no sense and wasted 6 hours of my time. The employees in the store told me that the fraud department do not speak to eachother and they can tell you something contradictory to one anotherr. At the end of the day I wasted a day and a half in what I can only describe as a bizarre experience. After which I went to Verizon and within 45 minutes I received both phones and a smart watch with no money down. After reading different reviews on here I feel Ive dodged a bullet by not signing with att.,0
If I could give a 0 I would for Att Bussness department they have been dragging there feet with getting my number all the way to a cell phone for over a month and have been pulling me around like a rag doll dealing with there business department is not worth it if you need a business like just put a second like on your customer account I strongly suggest staying away from there business department also dong expect to get fiber even if you have a fiber optic terminal pole in your yard from Att becausei still haven’t got it even tho I have had a pole ac fiber lines for over a year ran,0
I called them to figure out what was wrong with my bill had bogus charges on try to take care of it when manager said My money was unhonest I would not give them one star but I had to,0
Worst company to deal withDon't join them you will sorry. They are charging me for a bad phone they sent,0
"Service is in and out. Signed up for $50 with autopay, they then turn off paperless billing so they can charge you $100 a month",0
"Customer service absolutely sucks. Their service is horrible no matter where I go. I lose my connection.  I’ll be in the middle of a call and it just drops I try to call people it says call Failed. I’m sorry I ever left Verizon to come to AT&T, but I’m happy to say Today is my last day with them. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere if you’d like to be able to have a phone conversation with someone",0
Worst company EVERRRRRRR. No stars but they wouldn't let me comment with one!!   WORST!!!!  THEY WILL SCREW YOU BAD!!!!,0
"The most abysmal phone service on the planet: overpriced- monthly payments equal to a car payment; unreliable 5G service with barely 1 bar (4G was much better); constant security breaches (terrible security system); and deplorable customer service.

"I waited for almost 30 minutes with 1 girl helping another couple. She never said a word to me the entire time. Then in walks a.man with food. He walks to the back stays gone a few minutes then comes to help me. He was extremely rude as I told him I was glad he was there as I've been waited almost 30 minutes. He said no...nore like 25. I took my phone and said I'll go elsewhere. He said we'll thus is MY store and I replied that I was HIS customer. He was rude, arrogant and looked like he was on something.",0
"Well ATT raised my monthly payment to 106 up 12 dollars with no reason, no added benefits. called att about this which of course i had to speak to someone who could not speak actual english, he tells me my bill after linking 2 family members would be 133.42 plus tax.get an email my bill is 455.72after cslling again they say that is not applying credits so the bill would be 199.45. i asked about the 133.42 i was told before, they put me in hold and after 15 to 20 minutes say they got it to 133.42.get another email saying the bill is 255.72.called again speaking to another person who can't speak englishthey screw it up again.avoid this place at all cost!!!!",0
"AT&T, a long time trusted icon of America itself, has been taken over by someone which I don't even have words for now. Making AT&T, bar none, the most crooked, and the most in-accessable, major Corporation existing on planet Earth. Leave AT&T quickly. Forget the name. It's not that name anymore. At least, that's my personal opinion.",0
"Terrible customer service waited 45 mins never got help ,seems like no actual people work there, just computers and robots",0
"Out of 7,037 reviews, AT&T has a combined score of 1.3. I'm sure the score would be even lower if they allowed a ""ZERO"" to be entered. Count me as one of the many potential customers who would give AT&T a ZERO if possible. The customer service is HORRIBLE. Over the course of 24 hours, as I waited for a missed installation window, I was lied to 3 times by 3 different customer service representatives who who are about as worthless as a hole in a pair of socks. I am currently looking for another company to provide internet at my business so that I will no longer have to EVER do business with AT&T again.",0
"ATT is aweful. I have 5 lines or so for over a decade and they are only getting worse as time progresses. The entire inferstructure for cellular data is owned and built by tmobile anyway, so you might as well not support a bunch of incompetent 3rd party tower leeches to analyse your data (which they profit from) just to connect you to a service that is available from tmobile( who also profit for all your personal data). Is TMobile any better? No. Not really. But seeing as how  att isnt even nessessarry, they are as cocky and putrid as should be expected. They can possibly issue refunds in 3 to 6 weeks but they cant give you back your time and effort and mental stability, not that they would even if they could. Their apps for security are depricated before you even download them, they charge for services they dont provide and they cost cut by routing all your issues as customers to non us based call support. Sound fun? No?",0
"Was quoted a monthly bill of $100 from costco. First bill was 240, second was 98 third was 150. The sales people lie to you. The customer service people don't speak english. WORST experience ever! STAY AWAY FROM AT&T.",0
"I am utterly disappointed with AT&T and regret choosing them as my service provider. The service has been nothing short of a hassle, largely due to their misleading advertisements and hidden fees. Initially, the plan seemed reasonably priced, but soon after, I noticed unexpected charges creeping onto my bill. These fees were never mentioned during the sales process, and every attempt to resolve this confusion with customer service led to more frustration due to their lack of clarity and assistance.Moreover, their lock-in plan has been a major inconvenience, especially as someone who travels frequently. I was shocked to discover that unlocking my phone for international use required an additional payment of $1000 to switch to an international e-SIM. This policy was neither clearly communicated at the outset nor does it seem reasonable or customer-friendly.Overall, AT&T’s approach feels deceitful and customer-unfriendly, focusing more on trapping consumers with hidden costs rather than providing transparent and reliable service. I cannot recommend AT&T to anyone, and I advise potential customers to consider other providers who value customer satisfaction and transparency.",0
so bad and so slow internet,0
"These guys are robbers, please be careful before signing a contract with them",0
Customer service is terrible.  They only care about their commission.,0
"I really dislike Customer Service of At&t. Ever since they outsource. Took me a month and half and 6 phone calls, 9 hours talking to someone, just to get a return label. To return a phone!",0
10 years as a costumer with them they decided to sell Att Puerto Rico and they wanted me to change  the number or I was going to loose it. They was going to give me a credit of 65 dollars when I was certain comfortable with my number for the las 20 years. They took a unit on trade in for a 23 ultra and since they was gonna give up or sell my number to the new carrier also took my trade in value which it was supposed to applied to the ultra they never applied and now they want me to pay $945 in order to unlocked the phone. They are really something special. I will not recommend them ever.,0
"I signed up for AT&T Business Hotspot in December of 2023. They told me it would be $45/month.The device never arrived, but I still got a bill for the service in Jan 2024. I called and they said they corrected it, but then I got another bill for over $300 in February. I called again, apparently they never canceled the plan from the device that never arrived. But they said they fixed the problem and assured me the price had been adjusted to the $45 agreed upon in December.Fast forward another 4 months, I've been on the phone with them every month because they are charging my account the incorrect amount plus hundreds of dollars in ""past due"" fees. Each time I'm on hold for 3+ hours and about 40% of the time they hang up mid conversation. Ultimately the bill is never corrected, even in the 3 instances in which I had written communication stating that they would change the bill.I'm currently on the phone trying to cancel my account. They have hung up on me twice now...I would not recommend them for business internet service.",0
Att sucks and att customer service is worthless,0
"I hate this company.  Last month they had 52 bucks of my money sitting on my account and wasn't going to apply it to anything telling me that they don't know why I paid it and my bill wasn't due. Then I pay 70 bucks thinking it was to the internet since the link said internet but guess what! It was to the wireless and now my internet is off, and after explaining to the rep. What took place, it's my fault because I paid with speed pay on their app. Are you serious.  So now when they return my money, my services still won't be restored because now since the services are suspended I can no longer do a split payment. Are you kidding me! I'm 🏃‍♀️ back to xfinity!!!! Listening to other people about cheaper services shoot I rather pay 220 dollars a month for faster service,  better customer service,  and payment extensions. I can't wait to cut AT&T off. Plus I can't never get anyone that speaks fluent English it just bothers me I have to repeat myself over and over, then they cut me off when I'm talking, then I can't understand them. I'm just over it. Never again!!",0
I give it a zero the past 3 weeks My internet has been out more than it ran. They tell me there and outage evey time but I still have to pay my bill.

"Three year business contract, was told it would be 2 years, locked in and no vacation mode, can only suspend service while continuing to pay full price. Verizon offers vacation mode along with everyone else. We’ve had nothing but problems, service never works, no credits given, and are now forced to buy out early and lose our phone numbers that were ours before att. Do not use ATT. The worst 2 years of phone service I’ve ever experienced, and our information was released in their data breach, again with no compensation.",0
"For years second time in less than a month my internet service has failed. Yesterday afternoon, July 17 my home Wi-Fi, (29512) AT&T internet air stopped working.  Their app said service would be restored by 2 am central time. This morning the app claims it will be restored within 24 hours. It hard to see how AT&T takes the needs of their customers seriously in providing such unreliable and inconsistent information. It is suggested that the review should be helpful - do your job.",0
The worst internet provider. I don’t know what incompetent fiber or cable dudes they have working in the oak hill Texas area but my WiFi has been out for 7 days and they’ve had today at 10 as when it would be back. They then changed it to next 24 hours. Now it’s for Friday at 3. Hope yall figure this out and give me my money back for all the time I’ve lost. Will be canceling asap,0
Worst experience ever. 4 hrs to change a plan. Then nothing at the end. Trying to route to phone line or store and when we goto store  they say call phone number and nobody can do anything. Pathetic customer service and nobody cares.,0
My son just shipped out to boot camp for the marines.  i was told when i set up his account that i could reduce his rate while he was gone by simply calling after he left.  i called and was told that boot camp did not qualify for a reduced rate.  only active duty and INCARCERATED PERSONS!  so basically what AT&T is telling me is that a CONVICTED FELON has more priority as a customer than a military recruit.  way to be behind your country AT&T,0
"I have been calling ATT for over a week about my bill. I’ve waited on hold over an hour more than once. I cannot get a representative on the phone. I’ve gone to my local store for help. They were sure that they could help me, but also could not get billing on the phone. I was told that I’d have to drive to a corporate store to resolve this. This is horrible customer service.",0
"My dad and I went to AT & T to upgrade my phone, and the girl working there told my dad that since he is a first responder he can get an iPad and a watch included in our plan and that our bill would actually be less each month. Instead it was $177 MORE and now we’re all having issues with our phones. We got completely scammed by a company we have been with for 20 years!! I called and spoke to representative Ratisha and she said that we can’t return anything because it’s been past 2 weeks. We didn’t get the bill until 30 days to find out they LIED about about them being free. The iPad and watch haven’t even been used yet! 20 years and still got totally scammed. I’ll never trust this company again. We will be changing services after vacation and I will spread the word that their representatives lied about their first responder program to us and now will not let us return the  unopened items. Also, apparently there is no management to talk to on the phone which is such a red flag. If you’re deciding between services, do not pick AT & T",0
"WORST EVER!! Tech has been out 4 times, problem not fixed. Tech called today and said his supervisor told him not to do anything,  that they could not fix the problem with my fixed wireless internet. That's it, no remedy, no option...nothing! Canceled my account. Been without internet service for 3 weeks, this is the worst company I've ever dealt with. Will never do business with them again.",0
"Double charged me $60 for a returned check fee for not updating bank account and never tried to contact me to update my payment information. After wasting much of my time they removed one returned check fee of $30. Sorry, I can not help that this is a worker country and I have to work and have no time to take care of business, family, or friends",0
"Be carefull with at&t!! They are liars. First they tell you you will get a credit regarding the X issue, that you should see it reflected on the next billing cycle. Months go by and is never apply. When you call them regarding the credit, they asked you ""what was it about?"" like they know nothing. Case starts over and same situation... months go by and nothing, you call again.... At&t play games with customers. Very unprofessional and careless company.",0
HiI am very disappointed by my billing this month I have paid $137 of my two cellphones which I don't understandMy bill supposed to be $100 which was committed by your sales person.You customers services are not serious to help your customers.So plz fix my billRegardsKashif,0
Att worst company  ever  went on vacation for 7days come back $1500 phone change. Just for roaming.High way robbery.They offer free phone to trade your old phone but they lock you to 36 months contract.  Scammers  AT&T HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO  CUSTOMERS,0
AT@T I haven't ever had so much trouble than with this company I switched thinking it would be better I was so wrong first week there phone service went down for a day of two now people are able to steal are phone numbers and my phones been acting up all the way around not a good company,0
"Since I bought AT&T I have had hundreds of problems with overcharges, they remove and add charges as they pleaseThe worst option is to acquire a contract for 3 years, those are three years that you will constantly be fighting for additional charges",0
"Aside from the rising costs over the years, the extreme “legalese” in superfine print no one has time to read when time to replace an aging phone, as well as the questionable practices regarding the AT&T insurance and submitting claims, and sales reps that may need additional training in communications, dealing with call centers that may not have clear insight on local issues – my recent issue begins with the mistake of upgrading to a Samsung Fold Z4 shortly after it became available.While the phone was impressive in terms of the screen size, it came with many more “unknown” cons I would learn about the hard way, than pro’s. Although Samsung boasts waterproof/resistant, it is not dustproof. Amazing that a speck of dust can create havoc on the screen rendering it unreadable at a significant pace and hence I had to replace it after 7(?) months or so…while I had insurance on all my devices had to shell out another 700.00+ to get the replacement. Ok, lesson learned, be sure to create a good seal around the folding part.In May of 2024  (with another 18 months of installment payments left), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth stopped working entirely and despite many attempts and online research to fix on my own, had no other choice but to get a replacement phone. I  did not want to deal with a claim at the time due to the frustration of already having to replace again and of course work and life. Went back to the AT&T store and explained the situation and wound up with a new phone and a new business line I did not need, it was not clear to me that although I brought the old phone in  at the time that I would be  stuck with paying installments on both. Again, I was not paying attention as the frustration just grew – especially after there happened to be a Samsung rep in the store and when the sales person asked him if it was common that the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would stop working and he shook his head rather non-chalantly and that is when I popped up and advised that is not what I discovered in various online sites – Samsung for one - regarding a known issue with the fold.Once I discovered I am still paying for the Fold, I called AT&T and an hour of wasted effort, I was referred to the claim site and here is where it gets really interesting. The Fold no longer showed up as a registered device so I could not file a claim… AT&T rep on the phone had me register the phone with my true number associated and I asked if that was going to impact my current working phone and basically had me attempt to claim on both phones… I can’t make this stuff up folks, simply unreal. I then went back to the store to see if the claim can be done from there and was told of course they could help. Only issue is the phone had been turned off for a bit so now it was not showing up on the network and when I asked how to do that as the phone did not work… no Wi-Fi – the salesperson asked her co-worker and he would not even respond to me which is ok, but stated to put a sim in the phone and make a few calls, etc…Went home and tried it and guess what? Still not showing up on network and now the screen appears to be damaged again… and growing. At this point, not sure if it is worth my peace to deal with this and just eat the cost. Moral of the story is check everything including the fine print, question all policies, particularly the insurance policies and whatever deductibles you are responsible for, and have a backup plan. My plan involves fulfilling my debt obligations on these phones and once they are paid for, removing all services I have with AT&T after many years as my provider and never doing business with AT&T again…Hope this helps in some way.",0
If it had 0 star I would give zero. This. Is the worst internet service provider. Practically a scam. They will lure you saying there are no hidden fees when later the bios will be 300-400 $ and when asked they will ssay its activation fees. They also told me that they will give me healthcare discount but later said not eligible and charged me extra. They also said in the beginning that they will give 50$ gift hard. That's the biggest scam and don't fall for that because i never received when I called and asked they said it will take 3-4 months to arrive. They are totally scaming people into getting their wireless service saying there are so many discount when you're joining and later on there is nothing. I called them to remove my activation fees but they did not. Instead ileach time the bills become higher and higher. I hope everyone is safe away from att,0
No disrespect to att cuz sometimes the speeds are good but wth is up with these speeds it was pretty solid 9-12 ping and. Now it 75-245 this is some 💩 experience,0
"AT&T SUCKS!! They moved us off our landline to their VOIP satellite service supposedly because we are in a rural area of Kansas.  PROMISED better service, blah, blah, blah.  We've had intermittent phone service for months, and have spent weeks and our time trying to call and connect with a desk than can help.  EVERBODY passes us on to the next desk telling us it's not their area of responsibility.  Seriously, we waited and listened to elevator music for an hour and 50 minutes before somebody would actually pick up only to be told we were being transferred directly to a desk.  Yeah, right.  Another hour of listening to elevator music and no help.  AVOID AT&T at all costs!!",0
"I broke my arm and had to have surgery. Needless to say, my mind was preoccupied. While I was in the mitz of preparing for surgery my home internet was suspended. I forgot to pay my monthly bill. My apology. I received no notification reminder that payment was due. When I tried to check my AT&T email for messages using my mobile phone using my data I no longer had access to the emails. Yes, not only did I not have no internet, I also could not use their email platform.",0
"Att customer service has directly lied 3 times to me,  3 phone calls over in 2 months. I've learned something new every time. All I tried to do is enroll in auto pay.

I don't understand how a big company can be this bad.",0

Service is always out been having trouble for 2 weeks now but they still want you to pay when there Service is mostly down going to try to find better service,0
"Absolutely worst customer service I've ever experienced.  My 70 year old mother many calls because their employee that messed up my mother account when they sent her to our home 4 months , still no resolution follow up or apology.

"Absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. Misinformation galore.

"AT&T is the worst cell phone provider imaginable! The rates are high, and there is no customer service. I was on hold for more than an hour with three callbacks, and every time the line went dead before an agent could answer. Five new cell phones were sent to my house without requiring a signature and, unsurprisingly, were stolen from the porch. AT&T refused to reimburse the down payment even though a police report was filed. I would never recommend AT&T to anyone!",0
"Worst customer support I've ever received. They signed us up in the middle of target, wasted hours of time, and then when we finally get home, we realize they did it all wrong. Waste of time, terrible company.",0
I am very pissed right now. We went on a cruise and there was no service. The cruise charged us 5 dollars for the internal message system. Just message through the cruise app. Nothing to do with att. The second day on the cruise was my husband’s birthday. So att send us a message that you can pay 25$ a day to have a service. My husband paid for one day so he could respond to all the birthdays messages he received. My daughter and I didn't even use our phone the whole trip. It was our way to live in the moment and be away from the phone. And now back home we received a bill and att charged each of us $125 so a total of 375 and say that we used our phone!!! My husband called them but they do not want to understand. He is going through cancer right now and said he is tired and do not want to fight with them and say he will paid and want peace of mind. I think it is not fair at all. We did not even use our phone and to be charge this amount! We being with att since 10years !! That is not fair.,0
"If travelling to the US and needing a pre-paid plan, Do not buy AT&T’s. It is complicated to set up and there is no customer support.

"These guys really dragged me through hell, couldn't port my number over, even though they tried several times.

Go anywhere but here for service of any kind.",0
Have be att  uverse customer since it started but they are discontinuing this so the go up on price to get you to drop it. This sh**was not that good lately but u don’t have many choices.

"My ATT wireless bill went up 30 bucks and according to them there will be credits applied to my next bill. It's always something with these people. I was sold into the service on the pretense of saving me money and I should have known they were lying form the start. I went with wireless along with home phone ,internet and cable. 3 separate bills and has me questioning my decisions. Just as soon as this 24 month deal is up I'm switching back. This is utterly ridiculous. ATT tou suck.. .",0
Absolutely deplorable internet. I've tried everything from reconnecting the router to moving it closer to changing it 2.4 from 5.0ghz nothing works it's safe to say that this is the most utterly disgusting internet service I've had in a long time GO SCREW YOURSELF ATT,0
Person In charge of us 'mat' was disrespectful arrogant and overall had terrible customer service skill 0/100 would never use at&t customer service again,0
Worst service I’ve ever had to experience in my 56 years on this planet. It took almost ten minutes to load into this website and write a review in my own home. I constantly have issues loading things and doing things on my phone whether im in my own home or the middle of no where the service is relatively the same. Thanks AT&T for ruining 2 years of my life👍.,0
YOU would have to be really STUPID to use at&t service for anything. You are very likely to be scammed and or your identity stolen and you bank robbed of your money. VERY unreliable internet service. The phone service is lousy and a ripoff with the I-Phone. Makes me believe that their only striving for the phone gamers and stupid people for their service to survive.,0
I can see why AT&T is the worst company for direct tv and any phone services! Your information is compromised and they could care less! This crap happened over a year ago and the news media is the only confirmation! When I called to cancel they hung up and had to go through another fourty five minutes to talk to clueless staff and still charging me an early termination fee! So if you like wasting money? AT&T is your place!,0
"Have not been happy so I switched to AT&T the phone I switch I can’t return if I could I would switch back cricket now I went to get a new screen, but I was cracked. They told me it was going to be free when I got my phone a couple months ago. It cost me $10. I feel like they lie all the time. Tell me my phone bill every $75. It’s now 95 When I switched, it was $92",0
"ATT decided to raise their rates due to ""global Inflation"" as the customer service reps indicated. I changed my autopay to bank account in order to get my internet price to what I was originally billed for but it kept defaulting to my credit card info for autopay. I called ATT but the customer service rep refused to help me. He said he couldn't change the bill to my original price even though I changed my autopay to my bank account. I'm not sure how he couldn't help, or maybe he didn't want to help but I ended up cancelling ATT once my current billing cycle is over. I'm switching to Xfinity for $30/month for 2 years as I only use internet for surfing the web and for sending emails. ATT sucks big time. They keep raising prices while other competitors like Xfinity has promotions all the time. At least Xfinity wants to secure new clients for their business. ATT has no desire to keep their existing customer base. Raising prices isn't helping their business at all.",0
AT&T has an incorrect email and incorrect phone number on file for me to access any kind of change to my account. They put yahoo instead of gmail and they have my moms number. How does this make sense. They said I have to go in person.,0

"Would be a 0 have been on repair hold for over 3 hours now over a broken wire at my parents house. I have been given 4 different numbers to call and back to second number. At att they have no clue how to treat a customer. I can wait my turn but this is definitely the corporate run around.

I have been with att over 20 years. I upped my internet to fiber 1000 about 2 years ago. Found out right before hurricane Beryl the the router I have doesn’t even handle fiber1000. So they have been charging me for 2 years for a service I couldn’t even use. When I call about this all the guy wanted to do was sell me a new phone or change my service to “save me money”. He harassed and badgered me until I agreed to a so called better plan which isn’t even close. To the plan I had when I realized this I called back to get my original plan only to find my old plan was a grandfathered plan they don’t offer anymore and it was too late. I am over att. When I finally get internet again I will find a new provider. And I will keep their equipment until make things right for the 2 years I paid for a service I didn’t receive!!,0
"I am the managing partner of a movie cinema in St. Louis.  We called twice today due to no internet connectivity.  We were told there is an outage and the issue would be corrected by the end of the day.  It's now almost 9:30pm (11.5 hours later) and we still do not have internet connectivity.  As a BUSINESS, we are critically dependent on internet connectivity.  The majority of our ticket sales are generated ONLINE.  We lost a lot of money today due to AT&T's inability to restore connectivity.  I wish I could say this is the first time we had significant issues with AT&T, but it's not.  AT&T is simply not a reliable provider.  Not for business.  Not for residential.  We are likely going to switch to Spectrum.",0
"I had to return a product. Their store in the mall would not take it back because it was purchased online. Their website had almost zero info re returns. Finally, I figured out that I had to call them. So I called them. After 54 minutes on the phone, I got a woman (somewhere in Asia) who managed to disconnect me after putting me on hold. It was a simple request I had for her to send a shipping slip but oh now, she could not figure out how to do that and got my number to call me back just in case. She never did. She just disconnected me. I had to call again. Another hour and no-one answered the call. This is a company that does not care about its customers.",0
"I opened with att in May 2024 transferred from Verizon wireless. ATT sale agent said that she takes waiver the activation charges for 4 lines and other discounts. But att charged over $356.00 in June 2024. I kept call att and emailed her the charges. She said that it would credit back to me in June or July 2024, but not that credit back to me. I called & emailed both her and her supervise/manager, but no responses and not fixed it. It’s totally lied to me. I am upset and so forth, so I will move att to different carrier in July or soon.",0
I have had nothing but problems with AT&T and I have given them years to fix it. They did good from about 2006-2019 but lately nothing but problems!!! For starters I had to get an upgrade due to my battery not charging...get the upgrade wont send/receive calls or texts. Then they send me an insurance replacement and charge me $350.00 NOT HAPPY as my phone was still under warranty and when I called to dispute the charge they said to talk to Assurion....Well Assurion informed me it was a manufacturers default and I should not have to pay. So I have spent the last 3 days trying to get in contact with AT&T and the agents always push me on to somebody else that I have to explain everything all over. So after more than a total of 4 hours on hold and explaining myself I had to put in for a call back for today and as soon as the agent said Hello and I said hello back she hung up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Been with att maybe 15yrs now and I'm really considering going with tmobile in or another internet provider. Last friday my internet went out at my home so I called tech support and after 3 attempts to troubleshoot the issue I was told a tech would have to come out. The only day available was Tuesday between 8am and 12pm. So I had to wait 4days with no service. When Tuesday came it was 11am I received a text from att stating that the tech is running behind and couldn't make the 12 o'clock window. At 2:30pm I called customer service for a ept and they couldn't provide one and just asked me to give the tech a few more hrs and they'll be there. No one ever showed up. Called customer service the next day only to be told some one would be out friday. A whole week with no service.,0

"I made a payment on 6/27 and they put it on someone else's account. I have spent days upon stays and hours upon hours trying to fix this.  2 times at&t requested a transfer and could not do it due to not having a read to this other persons account.   They ask me for their passcode.  It’s not my account,  how would I have access.  They say it is not their fault because I paid on the phone.  Are you kidding me,  that number is the number you gave to me on the email to call.   Once I pay off this phone,  I will never use their service again. At&y is horrible at customer service.  T-mobile’s actual service is not as good, however they bend over backward to keep you happy when they mess up.  I miss T-MOBILE AND WILM RUN BACK AS SOON AS I can.  AT&T you are so disorganized.  You could not find my payment twice even with my confirmation number you guys emailed me.  You emailed me the transfer was successful and it was not.   When I did have 2 services with you,  you could not link the accounts.   For such a big company you Guys are so horrible with the tools your reps have to solve your clients issues.",0
Very bad service in the world. Like to do less than one star. Billing department is very sucks ...Lots of hidden charges.,0
I have had ATT mobile service for 2 years. I signed up through SAM'S Club. The account was set up using the wrong phone number. I have contacted ATT several times to correct it and was assured that it was correct. I have been working with ATT for 3 days now to correct this. This is desperately needed due to I can not make any updates to my account because they need to verify it's me by sending the code to this incorrect phone number. Well that protects ATT but doesn't help me. Today after going through this vicious circle again I had the smart idea to contact the Escalation department to be told that according to a supervisor these accounts setup via Sam's Club are no longer supported. I will be canceling all accounts as they come up for contract renewal.  I have had some type of account with ATT since 1977. They have now fallen to a state for which I don't see them recovering. No support or care for their customers is as low as they can go.,0
Att services is terrible.. the quality is worst than last year..weak services..customer service is useless..really..because they can't do anything the computer won't do..useless!,0
"Have been with T-mobile for 10 months. Customer service was great, cell service wasn’t working out called ATT to see what they could do. I asked about a 12 month prepaid service they advertised. The woman asked why I wanted prepaid and then hung up on me. Called back and got someone new. Told them I was a veteran and asked about the discount. When she said it was 80 dollars per line, I said it was much more than advertised on line and that’s when it went downhill. She was borderline yelling at me. I asked her why she was so mad and she didn’t answer. Thanked her for her time and end the call. Looks like I dodged a bullet. If this was potentially new customer behavior, I’d hate to see if I had an issue.",0
"I recently switched to Att and I feel I was lied to. They say everything they want to hear to get you to switch and now I have to keep Att for 3 years or l'll need to pay off the phone we got supposedly for free.

I also just learned that you have 14 day I think to cancel if you're not happy and I was never told that.I'm so upset and I can't wait for the 3 years to be over so l can cancel Att. Att sucks,",0
Atnt is the absolute worst! One manager told me one thing last week and today after holding on for 2 hours on the phone to speak with a managerthey changed their whole story I have had Atnt for over 12 years but no more! They gave me false information and changed my plan without informing me. I had no idea.#dontgetatnt,0
"For the third time and the second within a year, my service was cut off for no reason except ATT did not refresh the connection in some way. I was driving around with no service for the day to only discover this when I returned home. As I said this is the third time this has happened. Called customer service on a second phone and after having to provide phone info and spending a long time on the phone the problem was fixed. No apologies for my inconvenience, just another day at ATT. Second, with prepaid service you cannot contact customer service other than by phone and texting. If you have no service and have only one phone, how do you do this? I tried to use the online chat service, but I was told they couldn't help me because I'm prepaid. This happened last year. I purchased a second phone at the time. I've been on ATT for around 20 years. No more.",0
"I would go negative if possible. I was with ATT over 10 years. Went to the Levelland, Texas store and had the worst experience ever!!!!   DO NOT use this store. Drive to Lubbock if you need to go to a store.   I am leaving ATT over this experience.",0
The client service is ridiculous.I couldn’t even apply.I don’t recommend.I wasted more than 30 minutes of my life for nothing.Search for another provide.I will be happier.,0
AT&T you suck. You raise internet bill and your service sucks and is worthless. You should pay me to put up with your company. Pls go to hell. I hope your co goes out of business,0
"AT&T IS HORRIBLE! THE BILL IS NEVER DRAFTED ON TIME EVEN THOUGH I AM ON AUTOPAY!!!! Then when they draft it, they draft my account for 2 payments at the same time! My service is always sketchy! Neither one of my mobile phones work in my office! I have to walk outside to get a good signal. Then they have the nerve to charge late fees when they do not draft the payment on time! They always want their payment, but their service is horrible! I truly despise them! I am done with them as soon as my mobile contract is over!!",0
I am done with AT&T prepaid cell phone service.  The past month I was told they overbilled me $75. The adjusted bill only reflected around $30.  At another place I lived they charged my card but disconnected my service after a week with no explanation.  I requested a refund but never received anything back.,0
"AT&T is unreliable and terrible for businesses, whenever there is an internal problem, the text supporters are absolutely useless. When they try to fix my internet they made it even worse. As a business, we have lost so much money to AT&T’s internal problems, from not being able to take calls to our lines and WiFi cutting off entirely, and all they give us is a $17 credit per day? We have lost over $8,000 of business and have to resort to using our personal phones as our main lines to take in calls.",0
"I paid for international travel prior to arriving in a high threat level country.  I was charged right away and never received the service.  They have a text chat function, which I used many times, day after day.  NO response, Zero. I had people waiting for my calls to tell them I was okay, ofcourse, I was not able to do this. They clearly have no regard for their customers whatsoever. I finally reached an agent today and was put on hold, then she hung up the call.  Do not consider ATT.",0
Horrible internet service horrible customer service.,0
Deserve zero stars. Called and canceled my ATT internet the first of June. It was turned off 7/7 and charging me for service 7/2. They bill for upcoming months. They owe me a refund for crappie DSL service and will not refund my money. I live on a fixed income and had new service connected the first of June and had yo pay for tgat upfront too,0
"The worst company .thieves charging every month without service excuses liars never try to grab ATT Never it’s enough  charges for everything and ridiculous. Have service 16 days and they want me to pay 265 dlls plus 90 plus 110  since April and still more NO .they lied to me offered a free phone charging company and then apears in my bill 1250 x3  of course I returned but now they want 55 dlls x3 = 165 for return, they LIED to me",0
I will give 0 star but not able to. Two times Atnt has increased my bill without my knowledge adding additional charge which is 120$ more. When I called customer care they are not able to answer and check history as I called them few times previously. Worse service ever and no proper mobile app as well. I had 6 lines in my account.,0
They deserve no stars!!!! Absolutely horrible service! Can’t even keep with payments always charging for wrong stuff don’t keep up with anything! Here it is the phone bill is split and paid and the service still sucks they absolutely SUCK!!!!!! They also gave a new so called internet air that don’t even work!!!! And then have another internet thing on when it was canceled and kept charging for it!!!! RUN AWAY FROM THIS DUMB COMPANY THEY SUCK,0
AT&T is absolutely awful. They have been trying to bury my fiber line for 5 weeks now. Came out today and severed my neighbor's line. Now they are out of service. Jump in the truck and sped away. Called customer service and go the run around. I have no idea when my ticket will be resolved.,0
"I’m moving to another address and called to move my services. At that time, it was determined that ATT Internet is not offered at that address. So I had the cancel my services. The gentleman was SO NICE and SO HELPFUL! However, since that call, u have received 5 more calls and talked to 2 people who tried to get me to keep my services when I move. WHY are they calling me like they have no idea that they don’t offer internet at my new address? Supposedly the calls are recorded. I’m not buying it. Talked to someone yesterday afternoon and told them to stop calling. Then today someone else calls. 3 of the 5 calls have been within 24 hours. It’s infuriating that my holiday weekend is being interrupted for literally no reason. Maybe they will take me seriously this time when I say stop calling me. GET IT TOGETHER ATT!!!!",0
"I should’ve stayed with spectrum, the service is no different-It’s unreliable no matter where I go, at least Spectrum has great customer service. Verizon is the best with service but they love adding random/incorrect fees & withholding information about actual cost-you can never trust them. Well, at least AT&T is consistent about their poor performance.",0
AT&T used to be very goodI’m with them since 2015Now they just charge you things for no reason and not refunding you unjustified chargesI’m done with them !,0
"Worst customer service ever. I work at a small business and we just switched our internet service over onto these ducking people. Tried to call 4 different customer service lines which all made me wait a total of 3 hours to get in contact with someone about our services being out. Our security question and security access code was never setup and to get any access to our account you need one of these things. The customer service rep was super hard to understand and when he needed to call AT&T using the same number they picked up immediately super unfair and disorganized. Don’t use this service at all, they don’t help and it all seems like a scam. Still dealing with BS currently.",0
my at&t is not working at all.,0
"Being robbed for not speaking English, I already had an internet plan in my apartment with At&t, I paid $60 and my 2 phone lines were from Mint Mobile and I paid $90 per month.I was receiving AT&T advertising at my house. On June 25th I was going to celebrate my birthday and before that on Saturday I decided to go to the store and look at the promotions.After seeing it I decided to make a plan by transferring my lines and buying an Apple Watch and an iPad.They offered me a plan with 2 lines for R$60 each, totaling R$120. The Apple Watch would cost R$19.45 per month and they also offered me an iPad for R$11.12 per month. They would also give me a 20% discount on the lines because I have an internet plan in my apartment for which I pay R$60.I have the prices for everything detailed.On June 26th I received an email saying that I had taken out insurance, I entered the chat on the same day, receiving very good service, they told me that there was no problem and that the service would be canceled and the amount removed from the account (but not it was because they were charging me).That day in the chat I took advantage and also confirmed the prices I contracted, and it was told to me that I should only pay the amounts of $120 for the lines with 20% discount; $60 online; 19.45 apple watch; 11.12 iPad.On June 28th I received the first invoice (5 days after subscribing to the plan).The feeling is the same, I was robbed, like a store the size of AT&T deceives me like that and adds plans and more plans, fees and more fees, services and more services, charging me a whopping $543.00. I would have to be very stupid to go into a store paying a monthly fee of 145.00 and want to leave paying 543.00.I hope At&t resolves my issue as quickly as possible.",0
"One of the worst companies I've ever interacted with. They made a mistake and trying to fix it has cost me a ridiculous amount of time and money, and no one seems to be able to make things right, let alone do a gesture for all my time wasted. I RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY TO STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.",0
I was a long time customer back in august 2023 i cancel my dirct tv with them and now im getting a bill for 2 months and i've been calling them since april asking them whats going on and all they can say this charges are ligit how can they be ligit if i cancel my direct tv with them the people i talked to cant do nothing i told them how can it be ligit if i cancel august 2023 all i told them was close my account with me not owing you guys nothing and we will be done they have some rude as people working there and managers are something else i will never do anything with them ever again,0
"AT&T has to be one of the worst cell phone providers to be. I’ve currently been with AT&T well over four years and I’ve started having issues with service. Now I did change addresses, which I notified them and they’re claiming the reason for my issues is because I’m near a large body of water. But that can’t be true because I can go anywhere and still have the same issue where I’m not able to make phone calls, receive phone calls, send text, and receive text. Even the Internet would not work. I told AT&T this and they said well there’s nothing we can do. We already get a lot of complaints from your area already. And that came from a manager. So once I pay off anything I have with AT&T. I will be heading out as fast as I can and never looking back. I advise anyone who is thinking of going to AT&T to definitely , DO NOT USE AT&T.",0
"I have never in my life experience such shotty service.  Our phone service is constantly going down, speed is representative of dial up, phone goes into SOS mode constantly.  Tried calling tech support and they just try to sell you more services.  I can't wait to switch!",0
"HORRIBLE COMPANY!!  We turned off the cellular data on our phones on a recent overseas trip and they still charged us for calls we didn't make.  Although we had been customers for over 20 years, they would not refund the charges. This is just one of many bad experiences we have had with AT&T. The customer service is HORRIBLE!!",0
"AT&T emailed me someone else’s billing information, full ID, and Full account number. When I called and told them they said there is nothing they can do, the other person has to fix it. So AT&T can send you someone else’s personal information and then have no way to fix it. They’re lucky I’m not using this information against the other person. Highly unsafe.",0
"AT&T is complete trash. My internet (fiber) has been down for three weeks now. So what do they do? Slow my hot spot. AT&T is loosing me millions on deals that I do from home on my WiFi and I called them and I got a simple apology. If you loose a f$&3 million dollars a f***** day. Sir. Pardon my ignorance. But your apology means nothing. Reimburse me ATT, you c$$$",0
Been on hold for almost 2.5 hours to get help with network issues that have been happening for a month now.  I have been a customer for well over a decade and this is going to be the last straw,0
"Stay away from AT & T Wireless.!!!   Basically they do not really know their cell phone coverage areas. All they want to do is sell you a phone(s). They set up an account with autopay so they can bill a month in advance, the minute your walk out of the store. Then if your phones don't connect from your home area,  they GOT YOU FOR restocking fees and a months service.   Then just try and contact someone at AT & T.  Their Service is almost non-extant .!!   The representatives make up stuff on the phone and no two will tell you the same information.    Terrible , Terrible company do deal with.",0
Now att makes it so if you buy a phone you can only use it on the line your buying it for.Another way to force you to spend more money.They  use foreign customer serviceIm leaving this company after 24 years of bull,0
"This is the worst company i been with and encourage anyone not to do business with these guys , they charge you hidden fees and customer services is horrible they keep charging you for all kinds of fees.",0
"When I first got service with AT&T 2 years ago I had no issues. Recently they said they were going up on prices (a rep told me because of inflation) and since then my wireless and internet are useless. I don’t get phone service in the same areas, several dead spots, and the WiFi is basically to watch tv, nothing else. And they’ve told me I have the fastest package they offer in my area. Don’t recommend.",0
"I wish trust pilot could give me the option to leave 0 starts, WORST COMPANY EVER. They scam you, steal from you and increase prices without telling you. To after they charge you, they can tell you that they can decrease the price after they charge you more than they should. I rather die than return to ATT. I switched to another mobile company, they told me that after the numbers are transferred, the AtT service lines would be automatically cancelled. We are a family of 4. Everyone except my sister choose to not change their number, just transfer the number. We ask several times if the limes would be canceled, they did it with the 3 phones that choose to stay with the same number, but not with my sister number. My sister number was active and they were charging 77.04 for it, a line that was not being used. I HAVE TO ALSO SHARE THE HORRIBLE WAIT TIME IN THE CALLS. In companies like Spectrum the wait time is less than 3 minutes, in Att is 1 hour or more. Worst mobile service ever. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. You paid your phones, they increase the prices of the lines, and also they charge 100 dollars when you request technical support on the home internet while in T mobile, Spectrum this is free, that’s why I said that they scam you or steal from you, because that is supposed to be a free included service. No way. Dunno how they can still in the mobile business. But karma exist and justice does also exist. Why they have to be like this ? Why can’t they be a good mobile company, why choose to be evil. Me, family and even friends will never be back to this dark hole called ATT",0
Absolutely terrible company that makes it so difficult to do anything online. For such a large company it is unbelievable to see how behind they are technologically. I am exceptionally good with technology and I am most likely still going to have to deal with customer service for a simple prepaid plan setup with esim.,0
No matter what they offer do not allow ATT autopay to access your bank. ATT withdrew $430 from our account for a duplicate phone they sent to us in error. We returned the phone through a certified ATT representative yet they still withdrew the money. After numerous contacts with numerous ATT representatives the money was returned but they immediately re-created the $430 charge. We shut down autopay prior to any further fraudulent withdrawals but now are harassed every month with threats to our credit rating if we don’t pay this money we in fact do not owe. Six months of contact with numerous ATT representatives and the harassment continues though at the end of each contact ATT admits that the error is on their end and it will be fixed through their fraud department. Only days later to receive contact from the fraud department telling us it is not an issue for them and we should contact customer service. That cycle has occurred through eight calls…many last over an hour. In our experience it is the ATT Fraud Department that is a fraud. Beware! Beware! Beware! ATT Wireless says all the right things to draw you in but provides absolutely no support once you have accepted their “service.” And we use the word service with quotes because there is not any helpful service from their end.,0
"There is a very low level of staff training. One gets the impression that they are coming up with explanations on the fly, although they themselves do not understand anything. The system's automatic responses at the embryo level speak only to say something not to the point. Very disappointed.",0
Att has the worst customer service!!!! They will continue to transfer you to another rep then the call will drop. This has been a consistent issue. My call today I was given a different number to call upon calling that number the rep tried to give me the original number I had 1st called sooo she gave me another number. That number gave me a number to sign up for a Medicare supplement! Now I’ve been holding 2 hours the rep explained she would have the correct department call me back. The rep that returned my call was again the incorrect department. I’ve been trying to handle this issue for 4 HOURS. And there sells reps are nothing but liars!!!!! This is why I cancelled  ATT after 25 years.I was a foul to give att another chance. ZERO stars,0
"The worst experience EVER!I wish I can give zero star here.Here is a story: decided to try a service for Apple watch I bough for my kid, but the service for watch does not work without a phone, so I decided I do not need that service (i did not activate that service, I did not use it a single second), tried to cancel it and was NOT able to do so!!! Went to customer support online, over the phone, two different stores and answer was the always the same - ""Im sorry we are not able to cancel this service without passcode"" (and thats after I provided all possible IDs - passport, SSN, driver license). So I decided to just remove my payment method from that NEWER USED service and guess what - ATT contacted me for no payments and threaten they will go to collectors.P.S Recommendations to ATT managers (PMs, TPMs, etc): learn the ""breaking glass scenario"" and implement it!P.P.SThe ""breaking glass scenario"" refers to a contingency plan that is put in place for emergency situations (ex: no passcode and client wants to cancel the service - they should able to do so!!!!)",0
"Want to waste 3 hours of a perfectly good day? Call AT&T customer support for something easy and straight-forward. Then get told you have the wrong department. Expect to get hung up on during the ""transfer"". Try new number, speak to new agent & get told the same thing and then hung up on again. Rinse repeat for 3 hours and never have your issue settled.  Their strategy is to play department ping-pong until you have completely lost hope of ever fixing your simple issue. Cherry on top; Their Fraud Department is completely brain dead with zero decision making power. Literally worst customer service, ever- I would give AT&T a negative 5 star rating if I could.",0
"If I could give less I would.Got told I could trade in my device to get a credit that would fully cover a new device in order to secure my business. Did so and later found out they're doing that over a 36 month period, something not mentioned at any stage during the sales process.I'm abroad and want to access the second eSIM slot in my phone to get a local plan in the country I'm in. AT&T have my phone locked and won't unlock it due to the balance on the phone from spreading my trade-in credit out over 36 months.Nothing they'll do to allow me access to this second slot. Got told there's a slight extra balance than what my trade in credit gives (annoying but no big deal) problem is if I try pay that early to remove the lock the remaining balance of trade in credits aren't counted and there's nothing they'll do about that.So now I'm stuck in a different country for a month with no phone service from their network and I can't get a local network on my device cause they're blocking it. Shady business practice. Don't do business with AT&T.",0
I have been a att customer since Bellsouth mobility for no reason they increase my cell bill 25.00 . They truly don't believe in customer in keeping your business.I true wouldn't recommend AT@T wireless and this coming from a person who has Been with thee since Bellsouth Mobility but no more.,0
Horrendous. The customer service is inept and rude.,0
"If I could give negative 100 stars, I WOULD! I was with AT&T prepaid service and when I went to port my number (which I ported to them from cricket!) They locked my line! They put what they called ""fraud protection"" on it and refused to release it!!! So now I had to get an entire new number because they refused to release my number! I can not believe this crap! I've had that number for 10 years and now I had to change it! I am so mad! I also want a refund since you renewed my plan today!",0
"Went to the store to get a new phone. a very kind employee was waiting on hold for 4 hrs. During the 4hrs i watched the sun melt slowly down the walls of the store with my mother. After the 4hrs and minimal progress was made, we finally got to actually purchasing the phone. We randomly got selected for a fraud department shake down. But unfortunately the fraud department was closed. I rise from my beautiful slumber to start on my pilgrimage to the at&t store. I was  greeted by my favorite associate and a new one who was just as kind. I sit and i wait. The anticipation was overwhelming, finally my iphone 8 that ive had since it came out can lay to rest. But again was met by the corporate thugs that do things with no rhyme or reason. Only to enforce the power dynamic over the little guy that is so immovable in our society. My disappointment is immeasurable. One star.",0
"They don't even deserve 1 star.  Their mobile sales team that sets up kiosks in places like bjs, Costco, target... They lie to your face about costs.  If they offer you a free phone, run like the wind.  Smiling faces tell lies.",0

Went there to get help linking my phone to a wifi tablet the lady there said I couldn't do it tried selling me internet service but then said for whatever reason I wasn't approved for it started talking about their tablets at 600.00 dollars I said I guess I'll send the tablet back and forget the whole thing I'm not really knowledgeable about any of this but went home and spent a good part of the day linking to Bluetooth got it all working and all is good she doesn't either know or care about what she's doing just cares about upselling will never go to this store at trinity point washington pa again they suck and the cabela drive store is even worse I'll have to find another store or a new service provider,0
"Absolutely horrendou policies they truly suck! Refused to change my pay date 1 day! 1 day short of my payday direct pay!! The hell they put me through going 1 day without service paying out of pocket costs, lost work running around to add money, health issues and torment! I felt utterly abused and enslaved! They forced me to keep my service because I'm poor elderly and disabled working part time to cover inadequate social security income. I paid cash for my pp phone to be told today that they cannot approve device unlock on my for 6 months after purchase to switch to another carrier service Sim card! Brutal Barbaric policies to force profits!!! I'm calling around for a lawyer! I recorded every call evey email text and my contract.

(A whole different story down there too)After we moved we’ve placed a Fiber home internet and everyone promised we will have $35 per month cause we have this another account with the company.But no. We’ve been receiving 4 months continuously $60 and every time I’ve called and asked why, they have been lying to me and saying that it is just first 3 months cycle and then, we will be paying less minus deduction for the overpaid first months.Now, I’m calling for our 5th month, and they are saying “oh no sorry that my other colleagues gave you false promises, your account is not eligible for this $35 per month because your other account is a business account and not a personal one.”))I’m tired . Tired of US ripping off their residents, lying for $ .And I’m not rasist but when you hire half of India or Pakistan , you at least have to educate them and explain how the business works before putting them on the phone like monkeys with fake names .",0
"I would say 0 stars, but not an option. They have told me numerous times my account is all set, I even have a credit when I check it online, and when a rep (when I can actually talk to someone) checks it, they agree - I owe no money. Yet I keep getting emails and texts referencing an unpaid balance and a credit card that is no longer on my account, and now they have suspended service until I pay a balance I don't have. I was bounced around through 9 different people, each more useless than the last. Customer service is an oxymoron, and this company is the absoluet worst. I would rather deal with carrier pigeons and the USPS.",0
They rip you off if you try and switch.They quoted 100 dollars for the phone and charged over 200. I will stear everyone clear of att,0
I call customer service regarding why the Internet not working. Made me do all the steps to restart. While she is checking I advise since I had the Internet phone we have been unable to make outbound phone calls. This representative advise me it's because of the outage. OMG I knew I had someone on the phone that didn't know what she was talking about. I have had the service for awhile. I had to hung up. I call back and when I was told internet outage started at 6pm and will be by 8am. Well no fix and now it's 2pm to 3pm. I ask actually where was the outage because I wanted to see there were anyone out fixing the issue...no real answer. Now I personally believe there was no one out late last night fixing anything. I'm sure there are going to charge a full month of service to the bill...at&t SMDH,0
"I am giving 1 star because there is no zeros… This is is the worse company. Always issues with them. My husband tried to switch his phone to another carrier due to bad signal in the area. Att asked him to pay off the balance on his phone in order to switch his line. They put it too difficult…my husband had to stay with Att however… they cancelled his line anyway, and reconnected his line. Plus, they upgraded his line to a Premium plan so he will have a better reception….. LIE!!! Nothing improved! So, I checked my bill today.. SURPRISE!! My bill is $615.98…. Really??? So I called Att to see what happened, the representative explained to me the whole mess. Why they shut down the line if the phone was not paid off? Long story….. now I have a case open, that may be resolved by July 2nd….. so, what is going to happen with the bill???  Because I am not paying it! Att is a joke…….",0
"It is almost impossible to speak to a human. I spent over 3 hours on the phone, some with multiple agents when I was finally able to access them. I pay by the minute of use. I made several calls to various AT&T tollfree numbers (most deadends without being able to talk to an agent). I finally reached a human by calling their sales department. I have multiple issues with my account and STILL need them resolved. The biggest issues is that after having called these multiple AT&T numbers they charged me for every one of them and will NOT credit me for the calls. They adamantly say that they do NOT charge for calls to A&T but they DO. I ran out of charge time on my phone so have to wait until Monday to continue. I cannot log into my account. They said they would send me a text with a password but ALL I got was a message saying my PW had been changed (no PW provided).AT&T gives rotten customer service and they do their best NOT to connect you to a human.

We have been with att for 28 yrs. My recent disappointment in service has lead us to leave your company. Please feel free to review our account for all the details and concerns we have had it's a book long.The biggest concern is no communication skills.I bought my self a new ph last July for my birthday it came the wrong ph the wrong color . Att says no worries the store will exchange it .... no that did not happen. My pain continues with finding out today I still owe over 500.00 for this ph that was a 800.00 exchange well I had surgery and did not respond to a text message that kicked me out of the promotion. I will share this on every forum available 28 yrs of loyalty means nothing . I remember when your reps would say ...How Can I Make YouA Very Satisfied Customer. Long ago. But my advice to att is you need to hire (Well Slow SpokenKind Respectful people),0
"Stay away from AT&T Office @ Hand and Ring Central for telephone service. They have outsourced all support to a call center in the Philipines called Global Support. I spent 3 hours today chasing my tail to try to get support. In the end, I gave up. I am now looking for a replacement provider. Their support people don't speak english well, don't understanmd english that well. Couple the language barrier with crappy VOIP service that lets you hear every other word and you start to understand the impossibility of fixing tech issues.",0
"For a month and a half I have been dealing with AT&T and I'm getting nowhere. I have 3 lines on my account. My son's phone screen just went black. We were told it was a warranty issue. We sent the phone back with a UPS label that was provided by AT&T, somehow UPS lost the phone because the only scan that UPS shows for that tracking number shows it was scanned into the UPS system and that's where it stops. AT&T has been rude and unhelpful. We were told by AT&T to file a claim with UPS, we did, then we get an email from UPS saying that we are the 3rd party and AT&T has to file the claim. We call AT&T and they are telling me that they can't submit a claim, it's our responsibility. UPS says it's up to AT&T and the whole time AT&T keeps saying that they won't restore our service until they get the phone or we pay $1000.00. This is ridiculous. I swear I'm ready to start calling attorney's to round up other people to start a class action lawsuit. First we had to deal with their damn data breach, now this. Can anyone help?",0
"I have been an AT&T customer for countless years. However, their customer service has declined to the worst level possible. Today I spent over two hours on the phone and was transferred 4 times. I was on hold over 1 1/2 and each time I was transferred, my hold time started over again. All I needed was to review my bill and options for decreasing my monthly bill. Once I did speak to a representative, they were poorly trained. The same person gave me different answers and finally I was so defeated, I just stopped asking questions. It was possibly the worst customer service I ever experienced! A very disappointed, long time customer!",0
"ATT has the worst customer service in their stores I have ever experienced. The employees lie about the promotion amount to turn in old phone and also sign you up for new phone insurance as well as other services without your permission or knowledge....? He told me my bill would only be $10 more a month.Not only that, but they continue to deduct money from your account after you change Companies. And after you change companies, you can no longer call or contact them since your phone number is no longer associated with them (Recording will hang up on you), and even when you could call and inquire about billing errors, which there were many, they never did what they said they would regarding refunds!They should be investigated by the Better Business Bureau and or government Agencies!",0
Worst company,0
"Don get AT&T!!!I was a Direct TV subscriber.  They constantly try ways to keep raising your rates. On auto pay you dont always notice until its too late.I cancelled my service on a phone call.  Agent told me they would get back to me on whether or not to return equipment.My bad for not checking but after a few months i noticed they where charging my card for several months 134$/ month. I called customer support who told me they could find no record of me cancelling.  I had no way of knowing because I disconnected equipment immediately after stopping service.when I told them that this was creditcard fraud after much discussion and several ""agents"" they reversed charges and money came back to my credit card.Now they are writing me letters threatening collections if I dont pay them back the money again.508$.",0
I paid off a phone through their debt collector and jumping through hoops of customer service in order to just unlock the phone at&t has a terrible customer service. I will never use this service again and don't recommend anyone to.,0
"I would happily rate AT & T a 0.5 months ago I had ordered an online sim card. But then it didn’t arrive on time so I went on to the store and purchase another sim card. Since  I no longer needed the online ordered SIM card, I had canceled it. But now, I see that I am being charged for the sim I never used, in fact canceled for the past 5 months.Now when I called their customer service (which is the worst), some had no idea what they are talking about. Some agents just disconnected the line and never called back after almost half an hour of waiting. And now they’re saying that I might have to pay for the line that I didn’t use at all, and the mistake of their agent who did not canceled it when I called them.Why I have to pay for their mistake and something I never used.And this is absolutely not a first time that i have suffered because of the worst customer service by At & T.Ridiculous!",0
I gave one because I can't put none but I buy my Samsung Flip 5 inside of a promotion and in the promotion doesn't said that need to buy it online and both customer service and neither a manager could help me with this offers and I buy it inside of the offer,0
Tried calling 3 times to inquire about home internet. Each time placed on ridiculous long holds. Will be canceling my mobile service as well. Terrible customer service,0
"AT&T does not deserve good customers (10+ years) if they shut off the phone without notice, and lock the phone to a robot.  For the Internet, I found Xfility for $9.95 a month.  They did not stop service or send threatening shutoff messages when ACP was not renewed.  I do not care to deal with AT&T again.  Thank you for your consistent concern, I appreciate it. I think I deserve back the $58.60 that I paid for the Interim phone, and some reimbursement for the frantic week I spent with NO phone, trying to find out why you shut it off.  That was nasty, being locked to a robot who demanded my credit card, and even nastier when I reached that woman.   I would appreciate a check for $58.60 for the month-to month interim phone (Lyca) plus a check of reimbursement for the Metro Mobile (att) which cost $62.73 for the Metro Mobile - plus the loss of a week, being terrified, and running around with a caregiver, desperately trying to get a phone set up.and for all the upset trying to get phone when there was no phone.  I REMIND YOU THAT I AM ELDERLY, DISABLED (STROKE) and it is highly dangerous for me not to have a phone to call for help, should I fall, or become frightened.  Due to your despicable handling of the Congress not renewing your government subsidy, you placed my life in danger, and caused me the loss of a frantic week, and $119.11 for phone service, and one week of caregiver time - 25 hours at 17.35 an hour through IHSS.   That is $433.75 that you owe us back, $552.86, plus damages for being so frightened.",0
"I just don’t have service ever. I was in fl and moved to co and everywhere is a black zone, terrible customer service as well",0
I would like to give a Zero because zero service zero customer service zero 💯 lies about the price and benefits and the representative is a big scam lies about everything and customer service is unavailable to help I can’t wait to rid of the fraud but sadly i have to wait until 2027  I’m not gonna recommended AT&T to my friends and family. I’m gonna tell them stay away from them because they are scam big liar and fraud.,0
"When I leave AT&T, I will never be going back. I ordered a mobile device on May 15, 2024, three times as an upgrade, and all orders have been canceled for no reason. Supervisor can’t figure it out, no one. I am on my 4th order and have very little doubt that it will ship. Today is June 14, 2024, still no device. The device is in stock in all colors, smh. Do not use AT&T as your phone carrier!",0
"Driver blocked my garbage cans, while working on neighbors poles. Why not block the people you’re working for??? Asked driver to move, he refused!!!",0
Since the breach my account was hacked. Payments we made went idk… someone filled a fraud thing and it was fraud against me yet you can’t get ahold of the fraud dept. my bill doubled ( I did not owe) turned off my services we just paid for and 2 months latter I can’t fix it.THEY R STILL BILLING NE FOR SERVICES I HAVE NOT HAD IN MONTHS!!!!I’m thinking of contacting a lawyer going to small claims.Customer service isn’t helpful either. They have my bank account 3214 that’s not my account. That account bounced payments and had money reversed to only god knows!!I’ve never bounced a check so SHAME ON YOU ATT!!!!I’d sugjest u fix this!!!Cynthia newton 916)904-4311I have called a dozen times. Went to stores in person.Verified the money I paid went to you and wasn’t reversed. This is FRAUD AGSINST ME!!!!Also u don’t keep billing for services u took away that’s incompetent.,0
"Horrible Experience with AT&T Cell Phone Service - Beware!I am writing this review to share my extremely negative experience with AT&T cell phone service in hopes of warning others before they make the same mistake I did. If this review saves at least one person, then it has done its job.From the very beginning, expectations regarding billing were not communicated clearly. This left me with a false sense of what I would be billed. Imagine my shock when the bill, which was supposed to be consistent, changed so much that it ended up being approximately $50 more per month than what I was initially told.The nightmare doesn't end there. Trying to reach the third-party seller that sold us the service at Target was extremely difficult. Their lack of availability and support added to my frustration. Even the local AT&T store admitted that the third-party seller did us dirty, confirming our fears that we were misled from the start.When I turned to AT&T customer service for help, they were anything but helpful. All they did was reduce our plan to something equivalent to the prepaid plan we had moved from, which was Boost Mobile. For the record, Boost Mobile had way better cost and service.This is a warning to anyone considering AT&T: Be sure you get any and all promises clearly stated, both verbally and in writing. Do not sign anything you haven't thoroughly read and understood. Ask them to explain it 20 times if you need to, but definitely get what your final bill will be IN WRITING.Our experience with AT&T has been horrible, and I will never use their services again. To make matters worse, we are now stuck with them for three years unless we pay a ridiculous amount to get out of the contract. Even our expectations regarding canceling services were incorrect; we were completely misinformed about what we could do if we wanted to cancel.Now we are stuck, feeling deceived and frustrated. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering AT&T. If it can prevent just one person from going through what we did, it will have served its purpose. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of AT&T.",0
I would have gave you zero stars if it let service worst service,0
"Since last year they have been charging me for service and equipment I don’t have. I’ve spoke with so many people it’s rediculous.  My bill is supposed to be $60 they changed it to $80, charged me for 3 boxes, because they kept messing up. I called the claim they fixed it. Next thing I know the charged &400 and cancelled my service. And saying I have tv internet and phone when I only have internet",0
"Horrible customer service. 25 minutes waiting to talk to a rep. Now waiting 48 hours for AT&T to unlock my phone, even though it is paid off. Plus their rates are much higher than the competition.",0
"They keep raising the prices. It went from 78 plus to 85 plus change to 95 for no reason. They signed me out of automatic pay and then charged me more because of it. I spent an hour and a half on the phone with a guy fixing it only for them to do the same thing a month later. When I signed up it was supposed to be 73 plus change but they added a fee of $5 for a free upgrade for something I WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR because you had to have the service for 6 months to be eligible. My two years is up in July and I am leaving this service and never returning. They steal money from you every way they can and unless you have and hour and a half every month to fix it only to have the same thing happen again a month later, it's not worth the aggravation. I am dumping a phone and living without it. I did that for ten years and now because of AT&T I am done with a phone.",0
"Totally ripped off by AT&T.  I was told by a representative when I transferred my internet service on approx. 4/29 that I would receive 2 months free service, due to the move.  He also reiterated during the conversation that I would make no payments for 2 months.  Not only did I not receive this, my service was disconnected shortly after I moved and I was charged $150.00 for not returning the equipment from the previous address.  I told them I was waiting for a return label and they stated to just go to a FED EX location and drop it off.  Had I know that, I would have already dropped the package off.  I called AT&T and was told that there were no notes reflecting the 2 free months.   I asked the rep where I would even get information like that?  I did not make up this conversation!   Not that AT&T cares, I will be looking for a different internet carrier.  I am super disappointed by AT&T!!!",0
AT&T is the worst phone service ever they don’t give a damn about there customers,0
"For the past four months our landline has not been working; either no tone, or no incoming call or a lot of static.  Every time we call, they say we are working on it.  There are too many trees in the area!  That is B.S.  They have not credited me for all the money that I have paid them and they try to convince me to get their mobile service.  Dream on.",0
I would give them 0 stars if I couldI have had alot of problems with this poor serviceI call and call and get told that the service will be fixed and it is not fixed and there's times I can't even get through to them to report my phone not workingWas told it was my phone and may need to upgrade to another oneI took my phone to be checked and it is not my phoneIt is there service !!!I am over this company and will never do business with them again!!!,0
"I would give it a zero star if possible. I have been a long time user of AT&T's wireless & internet service for years and paid all bills on time, and they made me go through hell just trying to cancel my service. They do not enable online cancels so I have to call customer support, and they do not list support numbers explicitly. Finally one of the numbers called me back, wouldn't honor my original date of cancel, and forced extra charges on me. I will never use their service ever again.",0
This company is a total rip off to customers.I can't wait to finish my contract and find another company. The service is terrible.,0
Bill went from $83 to $174,0
"I’ve come to this company, which was truly the worst decision I’ve ever made. I will find a way to get out of this horrible contract because I have been lied to for the last 4 months and no one seems to care. There is always a reason they can’t do anything to help me and I’m truly upset. I was told by a representative that when I can to AT&T from T-Mobile that they would buy me out of my contract with T-Mobile and now I have a balance in collections for $255 dollars that I just found out about today. Not to mention, I was told that my bill would be $89 a month and the lowest bill I’ve seen has be $125…. And every rep that I have spoken with has been unable to assist me.  This is ridiculous across the board and I truly truly truly DESPISE AT&T.  This isn’t fair at all and I want out of this contract.",0
Worse network service and kind a scam plot to switch from other carrier. Gave me discounts and almost the same rate of my previous carrier. After switching they starts increase the amount of bills. After 25 months almost doubled my bill amount.,0
"I recently called to lower my AT&T bill, as the bill was over $500.00 and there was a mistake. I had explained the situation of what had happened as I had sent a phone back and it was not taken off the bill. I was told "" I could lower my phone bill from two $230.00 to $ 209.00 and change plus tax"" with an additional line and a ""free"" phone. I should have known better as my bill is now over $300. I called to discuss the bill and  was disconnected by 2 customer service representatives. When I spoke with the first customer service representative on lowering my bill. Initially, on May 13th. I was on the phone for atleast an hour, never had one disconnection. I was being very polite although frustrated. When I spoke with the second customer was representative, he asked for a good contact number in case we got disconnected. I gave him my phone number and went over all the figures, the bill was higher than the first representatives figure! When I asked him how he arrived at that figure? We mysteriously got disconnected. Which his figure was more than the first representatives figure of $299.19. his figure was still over three hundred dollars and, that was with canceling some features I had on my phone. That is more than my car payment!!! It's ridiculous and obviously the AT&T  representatives lie to you. I am going to go down to the store tomorrow and cancel my service. Not to mention that I've been losing service at times for hours and It has been all over the news of the outages. I am done with you AT&T!",0
"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the service I have received from AT&T. The experience has been extremely frustrating and has caused me significant inconvenience.The issues began when I traded in my device and it was subsequently lost by AT&T. Despite my efforts to locate the device, I have been provided with conflicting information and have been unable to resolve the matter.Furthermore, I was misled by a sales representative who provided inaccurate information regarding the cost of my service plan. This has resulted in unexpected charges and has added to my frustration.I have made multiple visits to the store and have spoken with the manager, but the situation remains unresolved. I have also been on hold for extended periods of time when calling customer service, only to be disconnected without speaking to a representative.I am deeply disappointed with the level of service I have received and would like to request immediate assistance in resolving these issues. I would appreciate a prompt response and a fair resolution to this matter.Thank you for your attention to this matter.",0
"AT&T is absolutely the worst company to deal with when it comes to cell phones or even their TV service. We have been working on this from March until June trying to get her number changed to a new company and they gave us the runaround two hours 2 1/2 hours on the phone, every time you call, we called like 9 or 13 times still nerve result just trying to get a release pin number. It seems like nobody there knows what they’re doing or has permission to do anything. I would not recommend this company to anyone unless you want to be run around and lied to. They are absolutely the worst stay far away from them . We have been working this since March until June 10 and still have not gotten anywhere and this is trying to get an 84 year old lady just to get her phone straight unbelievable",0
"Went to the high ridge missouri at&t store at the end of March to ""upgrade "" or so we were told. We did not upgrade at all this is the worst phone and service we ever received from at&t. The little girl working was rude as could be anyway and talked us into a complete lie. Shame on you. Then the manager says oh sorry will try not to let that happen again in so many words. Absolutely disgusted with this",0
"Was solicited in a Target store to upgrade my phone.  Was told that Pixel would be equal trade, and that my plan would not change. I read the website before I submitted my phone for value evaluation, but somewhere in the paperwork fine print,very fine print...regardless of the value of your phone you will be locked into a new 36 month contract.  You can't get your phone back, owe no. You donate that to AT&T. But if I move to another carrier I owe AT&T $555.46. Scam(maybe, I definely feel like I've been scammed)?? Deceptive...DEFINITELY!",0
"Stay away from this Network.Awful customer service.I nearly lost my number while they trying to port and left me with no service for 2 days  and they confirmed i have good signal at my home address,but very bad signal.In 1 week  time i switched back to another network .I wasn’t even bothered the money i lost.If you need to speak to someone its take ages to connect.Awful Network.",0
"AT&T is the worst cellphone company I have ever been with. A sales person came to my house unsolicited, lied to my husband and I about our phone bill being lower if we switched over to them, said we would get $200 gift cards each for my husband and I, we caved in and traded in our phones and the sales rep lost or just simply didn’t ship my husbands phone so now they are saying they don’t know where it’s at and can’t give us the credits for it even though they lost it! My bill has not been low at all and I’m paying more than I was with my previous phone company and it’s been 7 months and my credits still have not been applied and no one in customer service will do anything about it, will be switching back over to my previous cellphone company ASAP!",0
"It took 9 days to get my WiFi running.  Not because of schedule date installation, but no one seems to know what the problem with my connection.  It took 5 agents, 9 days, hours and hours of wait time on the phone before someone finally figured out that I needed a fiber installed in my home.  Unknowledgeable customer support.  Hours and hours and days of wasted times. Frustration and anger is what I've experienced with AT&T just to get my wifi installed/transferred. I was ready to switch to Spectrum which I will soon if it wasn't for DirectTV steam which only offer to ATT&T.  But, my anger and frustration still exist with this company, I will soon switch and my friends and family will know exactly what my experience is and how I feel about AT&T.AT&T needs to train their support team in every aspect of figuring out what the issue is.  Should have the same support person to guide you through the process until it's resolved.  ATT should follow-up with customer to check on the results to see if it was resolved.  Not the customer calling back and be subjected to hours of wait again, be told get a call back just to go through the same process again with a new customer support.",0
Agents rule and hang up it was a man taking the call. Because I have been at AT&T since 2013 I have never had a phone cut off and tried to explain to them. when I had my surgery and was out of work 3month and tried to work the plan I had two situations going on. I don't appreciate it at all I keep your AT&T business going. From now on when I finish my device I will never get any more phones this time. I am move forwarding this AT&T company  !!! I get treated like terrible.,0
Had their land phone service and then I added dsl. I started with 10 mbps and after a few years it went down to 0.57. After 2 weeks the phone just went dead by itself. I was just paying and getting nothing. I called them and they said nothing wrong on their side. I switched to spectrum and have been happy ever since,0
"I had someone give me a quote for AT&T cellular, as I was having the AT&T fiber installed. Needless to say the wireless quote was way lower than what I was paying. So I made the switch and guess what, after it was all said and done I’m paying more. After many calls to customer service, which is a joke, I found out that I had the best deal possible. So now I’m paying less for a lesser service. If someone comes to your door selling their cellular, stay away and just realize it’s not what it appears.",0
I was lied to by AT&t twice when I got a phone and was told that I could return it and get a full refund. I signed up at the Walmart kiosk with a AT&t employee who lied to me and said that I want it be billed at all since I returned the phone I was unhappy within 4 days and canceled service and I still had to pay close to a $10 bill 30 days later. Another lie that the AT&t representative told was that he explained to me after I returned the phone I want to be able to sign up with AT&t again for 6 months which is okay I hope I never have to use them again but it was still another lie,0
"Att trade in service is a fraud. They estimated my iphone 13 was $700. But after sent in, and waiting for a 2 billing cycles, they credit me back $210. I am not agree with that and request for my trade in phone back but they stated that I have passed 14 days of return and as and online agent, they don’t have access to resolve. It is a scam. Please dont do trade in option because you will lose your phone value big time. I am a long time customer with att, and I promise to cancel because they are robber, they robbed my phone easily because I trusted them and sent my phone to them.",0
I used AT&T for 34 years. They could care less. They give better deals to a wretch off the street than long term loyal customers. I literally hate them and their woke culture and will never ever give them another cent. And the same for Directv.,0
"ATT makes promises that they don't keep. I established service six months ago an set up auto pay the same day. There is supposed to be a $5 discount for autopay. As of yet, six months later, there still is no discount! I have contacted ATT and they don't know why it hasn't been applied. There is nothing they can do about it! ATT lies and cheats it's customers.",0
"My dad’s truck broke down so he put his entire paycheck into it, he couldn’t pay his AT&T phone bill. His phone was cut off, so I called AT&T to make the payment myself. I was on the phone for an hour and 45 minutes, the entire time she was trying to sell me things. Finally, when I just had to tell her straight up, I’m not interested. I want to pay my dad‘s bill, she just hung up. Wasted an hour and 45 minutes today, my head hurts now. I’m getting my dad to switch to my phone plan, I am so thankful I didn’t purchase anything she was trying to sell. AT&T customer service is horrible.",0
"Be prepared to wait up to 3 hours to get someone on the phone, and then when they help you they will nicely SELL you an outdated phone or their Air internet service that looks like a toy and cannot be setup with customer support only available during business hours. Good luck with tech support. Don't get suckered into their selling tactics. I am on the phone now waiting again. The worst customer service.",0
"I wish I could give them zero stars. My bill changes every month. They do NOT honor payment arrangements unless you talk to a human (don't try to use their automated for this, it will not save!).For over 18 months I asked them how I could lower my bill and was told I was paying the lowest possible, then one day when I asked, the guy was like, ""Sure, I can lower it $10 for you!"" So for 18 months, I was paying $10 more than I should have.I've already been a part of ONE class-action suit against this terrible, corrupt (IMO) company, so I know they are crooked. I'm leaving them and going to Consumer Cellular.",0
I've been without my service for 2 weeks. I've been trying to get a tech out to fix the problem and no luck. I see they have gotten to big to give simple customer service now. I'm going to have to switch back to Spectrum which is just as bad!,0
"Don't bother, they will quote you a good price, tell you you are getting great promotions, tell you it takes months to show up on your account, then the promotions will never show up and you will finish out your contract paying 50-100 dollars more than they quoted. They will do nothing about it.",0
"Tech did not show up for appointment. I called. First time, the rep put me on hold…did not notify me I’d be on hold for 30 minutes. Second time I called, rep told me to put my desktop in a laundry basket and go next door for internet.Update- after speaking with another customer service rep.- the repair guy was running late. He finally showed up at 8pm (12-4pm was appointment time) and was able to fix the problem.",0
"My experience with AT&T has been extremely disappointing. My internet went down early Monday morning, and despite multiple calls to customer service, the earliest technician appointment I was given is on Friday. This prolonged outage has caused significant disruptions to my work. Additionally, communication from AT&T has been lacking, with no updates or proactive outreach to inform me of the status of the repair. I expected better service and support, especially considering the impact on my ability to work from home. AT&T needs to improve their response times and customer communication.",0
"Bought a NEW phone. Opened the package and tried to charge it, defective. They want to charge me $55 to replace it. The first phone was suppose to be brand new and not broken! Why should I be charged to replace a phone when I never received what I was promised, a new working phone. I have been with this company for many years, but this is the last straw.",0
I've had scam calls and Vodafone won't reimburse me as I've been charged. Was given the gigacube for wifi and it was the worst thing I've ever encountered they sent out broadband and then cancelled it.. The signal is absolutely horrendous they don't do anything to help loyal customers the call centre staff are unhelpful and just don't care the worst phone company ever!,0
"Vodafone mobile network reception very poor. Same like Lebara/ Vodafone /Talk mobile all are same company different names. N1C 4PF and E11 3LJ both are internet very poor. 20 years ago was same reception in my area, now 2024 still same. You can't search or watch any streaming in indoor.I'll say avoid Talk mobile and Vodafone until they improve network coverage.Thanks",0
Very revealing that all the good reviews are to do with Sales. The only thing that Vodafone truly does well. Watch for creeping bills. They have a nack for raising bills surreptitiously. Run by over-privileged cotton-wool mouthed toffs with no real world experience. Takes.,0
"We went to Vodafone for our WiFi in October 2024 and, to this day, it has not worked even once. They replaced our router, it did nothing. We've on the phone to them multiple times, even been on multiple video calls, and nothing has been resolved.After months of paying for no service and being asked to do the most basic trouble shooting over and over again, we decided to try and terminate our contract. Apparently, we still have to play termination fees, because it seems months of no service and condescending customer service does not qualify us for the right to leave. Also worth noting, the customer representative said there was no notes on our account saying we were even having trouble after multiple calls with them.Don't waste your time on their broadband packages.",0
I have 3 contracts with Vodafone and have been a loyal customer for over 20yrs.But I'm getting to the point where I will likely move them all because I have now been without mobile data for 4 daysLast thing I received was a message saying I don't need to do anything it's being looked at... since then absolutely nothing!,0
"I would give zero if I could. My home broadband is supposed to be switching to Vodafone today buy yesterday at 16:51 I received an SMS and email from Vodafone informing me that Vodafone have cancelled my new Home Broadband order without an explanation. I spent the next three and a half hours speaking to different Vodafone agents and also with my preset provider to try and stop being disconnected but achieved nothing. The only solution Vodafonre offered is to start a new contract and a manager will call me within 24hours. If no emergency action is taken today and as soon as possible, I will be with no broadband or phone line for the next two weeks. This will be a disaster as I am heavily dependent on my broadband.",0
"Had an awful experience with Vodafone customer services. If you eventually get to speak to a person instead of a robot you cannot understand a word of English they are trying to speak. Mainly they are rude, with the exception of a few and despite me trying to relay a problem with my broadband over 7 separate phone calls, nothing was ever communicated to Openreach. Needless to say I cancelled my account and want nothing more to do with Vodafone EVER!  Think twice before being enticed by their cheap deals because it will end up costing you your sanity.",0
"6 weeks and still waiting on broadband installation. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Terrible, disjointed service. Gave me a complaint ref then closed the complaint without speaking to me, I still have no service and am told simply to wait",0
An absolute disgrace.  I have been charged a late payment fee that they refuse to refund after I was sent what appeared to be a fraudulent text.Vodafone confirmed it was not them and so I cancelled my direct debit and set up again just in case.Vodafone now say it was them and they apologised for their mistake but the refuse to refund.I’m also told I cannot complain because their Ask Once service is only in a trial phase and so there is nothing they can do.As always a dreadful experience with a company who cares about one thing and it isn’t customers.,0
"I put extras on my account, but they were really difficult to remove. I spoke to some one, who - basically- tricked me into not cancelling there and then and sayin if I waited until a certain date I could have the charges removed that month. Not true. IF you get through to them on the phone, don't let them trick you into not making the changes you want right there and then. I have finbally got the charges removed, but have ened up paying for a nother three months. They seem to think that is OK. Wish I could leave them. AWFUL SERVICE,.",0
Don’t touch Vodafone with a barge poll. My so called contract went from £40 to over £150/month - pure daylight robbery! This is nearly surpassed by the sheer incompetence and appalling customer service - which has to be done over Twitter of all things! And after paying extra to terminate my contract before it skyrockets - I can’t get anyone at Vodafone to confirm that my final invoice/payment is actually my last. Seriously stick to SIM only people - these companies can’t be trusted.,0
"Had Vodafone broadband, and organised to have connection moved to new property a month in advance (allowed by the contract). They said no engineer would be needed and would be up and running on day of moving in with same router.Moved in to new house, connected router, and nothing. Contacted Vodafone, and after an hour it transpired they had accidentally closed my account. It would take 2 weeks before internet could be restored, and it took 2 hours to reinstate a new account.Awful service, and the second big screw up I've experienced with Vodafone.",0
"Be weary about extending your contract with Vodaphone! It can destroy your credit score.I was an existing customer and when my deal came to an end I applied for credit for a new phone and SIM plan. Which was actually cheaper then my current deal.Vodaphone's credit team applied 2 hard searches to credit file, which has completely destroyed my credit score. This is even more frustrating after having a pristine credit file for a considerable amount of time.I have lost hours of time now writing to the Ombudsman and FCA to try and get this corrected.It is appalling and seriously wouldn't bother taking the risk.",0
"Revolting customer service over the whole year since I entered the contract.  First they put me on on their legacy systems, then they  could not resolve roaming charges, even though i had these charges included in my contract, and now they simple closed my complaint.  I am shocked. Totally incompetent, unpleasant, extremely poor service.MY EDIT:  The reply form Vodafone is equally unacceptable.  I called them and emailed them enough.  Where is the telephone number to a competent person??",0
"I went from moneysupermarket for a Vodafone deal, at the checkout stage am told my personal details are wrong but it doesn't specify what. I try a couple of times, delete cookies etc, but no change. The bot chat is slow, and an adviser appears but disappears mid chat. I try again, nothing. I call, first time it's picked up but no voice. Second time, I'm put through to X, Y, then Z in sales, who says she can't help process the deal I want as it's online only. This has alll taken most of an hour. Absolute waste of time, and it's exactly the kind of crap I got at EE hence I left.",0
"AVOID VODAFONE!They owe me over £320 compensation due to being unable to connect my broadband on my activation date. BUT.... it's not the money that matters, when people lie to you, it means you don't matter. Choose a better provider.",0
"Simply horrible.Signal wasn’t very good, the data hardly ever worked.We eventually left and joined EE, my contract was over. However about 2 months later I got a letter from a debt collection saying I owed Vodafone £30 something. When I contacted the debt collection agency they had no idea why I hadn’t been notified and sent it back to Vodafone. Vodafone didn’t apologise or explain why they never told me I owed them money. I paid it since it was £30But my partner (who also left Vodafone) was told he owed them £210 for the remaining contract balance and phone. So he paid that, but then 3 months later, he has received a letter from a debt collection agency saying he owes £510! Where on earth did this number come from? He contacted the debt collection agency and they sent it back to Vodafone. He has emailed Vodafone wanting an explanation and has not yet received one.We even got a letter saying that his account was settled with the £210 payment. What an absolute joke. Would not recommend",0
My iPhone broke before Xmas- it is covered by Vodafone for repair or replacement.The people in the store were pleasant but really poor at communicating what information was required to be able to send the phone off- I had to go back twice and my husband once. Information given was completely contradictory and caused a significant waste of my time.,0
"My wife upgraded from ""pay as you go"" to ""pay as you go plus"" as Vodafone kept urging her to do so.After a week and a half of total frustration, being messed about, not being able to use the app to log on (the sole means of access), spending endless time on the phone to get it sorted out, she gave up and told Vodafone to just cancel it. She's now gone back to basic ""pay as you go"" with her old number.A week an a half totally wasted!",0
LIERS!They admitted on the phone that they lied to me multiple times. Were they bored? Were they incompetent? I do not know that. They did nothing to help me afterwards. Had to spend 5hours on the phone with them to sort the easiest of issues.I have never had such bad experience with any kind of service!,0
"The worst experience I’ve had. As a first time for trying to get a phone contract to build my credit score as a young person. It took them 8 weeks and over 5 in store visits. Multiple credit checks were run and effected my score. At to top it off I wasn’t even able to purchase a phone. I am utterly gobsmacked at the service and how they let this happen to multiple people due to system errors on their end that leave customers without a phone and an affected credit score. I use my phone for work and missed multiple events were it was needed as they couldn’t resolve their issue. Would not recommend, the entire infrastructure at Vodafone is useless and they couldn’t seem more uninterested in helping you",0
"Twice recently I’ve tried to upgraded and both times I’ve been on the phone what seems like forever and never got even a price because they don’t know there stuff, good god how are they still in business, EE here I come after 20 years of being loyal",0
I ordered a broadband package from this company and made appointment to deliver the equipment 4 times but did not arrive.  Eventually after numerous phone calls it did and when I complained their response was it arrived on date of switch over.I wasted 4 days and no one cared will never buy from this company again,0
"Had broadband since 2020 and it's got steadily worse since. The past few months have been unbearable. I work from home and can't do half of what I need to do due to poor speeds and an unstable connection. I have spent several hours on the phone to Vodafone over the past couple of months, and on 22/12/24 I was told I could leave if the issue wasn't rectified within 30 days.On this time, I have made several calls to customer support who have offered contradictory advice on every call with no improvement. I have also had a visit from Openreach, that did absolutely nothing. Today I was given yet another 24 hours to wait before being given a call back to find out that the issue has yet to improve. I was told today that if I cancel, I would be liable for the early termination fee even though I am already paying for an unusable service.Shocking network, shocking service. Absolutely avoid. Thankfully, the staff have been pleasant so that's the only plus point.Update 20/01/25Vodafone still have no record of the email they have sent, which I have helpfully tweeted at them after spending several more hours on the phone, being passed from home broadband team to cancellations, and back again. They are still insistent that the cancellation fees apply, even though we are now at 30 days since I received the early termination email. Shocking customer service yet again.",0
Staff not remotely helpful online or phone based.Been with Vodaphone for 16 years every time i contact them its a new challenge to actually speak to anyone who can help with my queries. The MOST unhelpful company i have ever dealt with Glad iv now cancelled my contract and moved to EE. Vodaphone is no longer what it used to be at all!,0
"Whilst I would say Vodafone are the best broadband provider for problem-less internet, I upgraded to the 250 minimum megaband limit but broadband tests never go higher than in the 90s which for me is Vodafone not agreeing to their terms. So don't upgrade!EDIT Vodafone say ring them up but i tried that. Been through all that!",0
"I bought a smart bike tracker GPS from them for £65. They have now discontinued the service, so I possibly have the most expensive bike light—thanks to Vodafone. = Regret.",0
"Poor customer service, e mails ignored and an impossible web site to follow. Bounced from dept to dept on the phone, after two hours gave up. After 30 years I'm going to a provider who values customers.",0
"Anyone who uses Vodafone knows most of these reviews are fake. Using the Wayback Machine you can see the volume of reviews on here jumped hugely from May 2023 to June 2023 and mysteriously the rating went from being 1.3 to 4. What a turnaround in just a month, it's almost like they used an LLM to generate plausable sounding reviews.The old score was reflective of the service they provide.",0
"Dreadful. I was sold a 150MB service that is slower than Plusnet standard. The router drops out all of the time, if you switch channels on the TV you are playing russian roulette with actually getting anything back. Just spent about half an hour on line with the service adviser, another waste of time.Of course to cancel they want a fee even though I am paying for a service that they said they could provide but do not appear to do so. They have drilled a load of holes in my house to fit equipment that does not work. It is that bad that I am going to pay the cancellation fee and go back to Plusnet, I should bill these clowns for the damage they have done to my property and bank balance. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Disconnected my number without warning, when I went to a branch for support, they were not interested in helping. Other networks are better.",0
"From the bottom of my heart I urge you to NOT pick Vodafone.  My WiFi was supposed to be installed in July 2024, we ordered the router and waited for somebody to come and install it, month after month it got pushed back, nobody would help us and we went 4 months without our WiFi being installed.  In November somebody finally came to install it; now you’d think that would be sorted - think again. Because I had not paid for the 4 months that we HADNT even used, they cut off our WiFi and said the only way to fix the issue was to pay for the full 6 months and they could refund us afterwards. Come to today, I have paid the full amount of 6 months, and they tell me that we no longer have a contract and I have to order a new router, but I CANNOT change my broadband to another company because “we have a contract with Vodafone”.  I have never had such an incredibly abysmal experience with a company in my whole life.  I have wasted 6 months of my life calling Vodafone for answers and every single time I’m on the phone for 3+ hours and have NO happy outcome. £130 down and STILL NO WIFI.  If I could go back in time I would have picked Gigaclear.",0
My broadband content control doesn't work and after 2 weeks of trying they still couldn't fix it which exposed my kids to adult content. Despite not being able to fix it they refuse to cancel my contract so I can move to other provider.,0
Customer service is probably the most expensive mini company I’ve been with over 20 years. I certainly would use them again very disappointed.,0
"We joined to Vodafone on 18th December and after New year we had  the problems and on 7th January it stopped working at all. Support service doesn't work. Everyday we are waiting update and they only change the date and nothing happens one week ago. Both me and my son are working remotely, but vodafone doesn't care. We are still waiting for any internet and asked the refund, will cancel this service once we get internet back...",0
"The misery continues. Day 6, still no internet. Vodafone first blamed Openreach, insisting they used the wrong type of Ethernet cable from the Openreach box to the router! Openreach had to revisit the property to prove there was nothing wrong with the Openreach box or the cable. They now think it’s a faulty router. Three more days pass. New router arrived today and yep, exactly the same, still flashing red! Openreach box looks fine, all green.",0
Just recently moved to vodafone for broadband. Agreed deal and price. But two.larger amounts now taken from account.  Not received  a welcome pack as promised. So no PIN number. I cannot get through to anyone without pin. Crazy. Tried two full days on chat. I can't answer security questions because none set up. Total waste of time. Day 3 still not  got anywhere.  They say they will send code to.my mobile. None comes. They probably got that wrong as well. Big mistake changing to them. Customer service doesn't  exist.,0
Vodafone are a complete shambles the logistics of ordering a broadband line has and still is a nightmareI thought Openreach were bad but Vodafone have surpassed them for incompetence,0
"If I could give less than 1 I would believe me! This network are financial bullies. I currently have a open financial abuse case against Vodafone. They have made up 6 different direct debits for one contract phone. Charging me almost £250 per month. So I stopped paying all 6 and just paid my monthly bill via the app. Now I'm getting letters threatening me with Debt collectors and they have sent the same ""owed"" balance to 2 separate collection agencies. To which I have paid one when I have been informed by my solicitor I don't have to pay any other than the one stated in my Billing section of my app as that is the only legally binding payment I need to make to cover my mobile contract bill. The amount of letters, emails and calls I get daily, would push even the strongest to become suicidal imo. Steer well clear of their new contract payment design as they dint inform you at the start that you'll have 2-6 separate DD..",0
"My line was cut of even tho my contract is still on going when I contacted customer service they said something about some other provider did it but the thing is I didn't go to any other provider (i think they are just BSing to save there skin) and when I explained everything they just say ""oh, ok we will place a new order and it will probably fix it"" and the order gets cancelled. This happened 4 times and no solution still its almost been 2 moths and don't have the service I paid for. I have to say dog Shit service with no real solution they could have just removed the other providers line and put in ours",0
"Broadband stopped working. No idea why and no-one from Vodafone had any idea as to initial cause. Interminable phone calls trying to get it sorted spanning a week. Issued me an 8 digit fault reference code. Phone system would only accept a 6 digit code, so had huge menus to plough through wasting time every call. Promised a call back which didn't happen. Poor. Wish we'd never left Virgin.Should also mention that we had to bin our previously reliable TP link mains adaptors when we signed on as we couldn't get them to work with the Vodafone router. Google research confirms we are by far the only people to have the same issue.",0
"After Vodafone messing up my broadband  install and leaving me with no internet, they got act together and fixed that, now 2 months down the line I find they are charging me for a mobile hotspot( that they sent I didn't want) and were going to carry on that 57.48 mth charge and the help desk idiots could not see the maths in the bill claiming the bill was correct.I've raised a formal complaint and will update asapPs the previous specialist care email I had previously referred 6 digit no doesn't workUpdate 16/1/25 after registering a complaint and spending hours on phone to the helpdesk and me demanding a supervisor contact me, a manager phoned last night to agree with my figures for the costs and has said he will refund me, but nothing else for my hassle.",0
"Update of my 28 Dec Review. Although i have proved my broadband is 27MB/s slower than the guaranteed minimum speed, my proof is not enough (ex BB engineer). They have basically said, that's it, it's your kit, live with it. They are mis-selling their packages, I believe they are over subscribed and their core cannot cope. I am searching for another provider. Choose another provider.",0
was with vodafone  for 6 days because they would not correct my last name they messed up they were only  wanting a 4 digit  security code from me  witch I could not remember .they did dot have the brains to check my form that I signed up with or my bank details  also my email address witch they had .so as I said only 6 days I had there router  and I took it to a vodafone shop in Aberdeen bon a cord centre .now I just got my bank statement with £28.oo taken out  by vodafone I returned there item with in the 14 day .rip off artists.,0
"Been with Vodafone for 4 years, never missed a payment, have Experian credit rating of 928 out of 999 but Vodafone failed my credit check for an upgrade and won’t give an explanation.I went to EE and they passed me straight away.Bye bye Vodafone 😊",0
After being with Vodafone for many years with more downs than ups and pricing does not reflect in fair customer service or what they offer with contract! Being on a 5G contract and working in a local city that they say 5G is an area they provide is false and misleading. You rarely get it yet pay for it. I don't live out in a remote area yet for the last year since moving I can never get a signal for 4G and network coverage is just awful for phone calls and have to rely on WiFi calling. So again why am I paying for an unusable service. You will get the general BS from customer service about this but ultimately doesn't solve anything so contract should not be legally binding. But I'm sure like many 1 stars on here which I find more true than the promoted 5 stars (think trust pilot needs to look into them 5 star reviews) you will just get poor service from this company. I have thankfully finished my contract to move to a cost and........ (yes I actually now have 4G at home and 5G works where it should) Giff Gaff are the way forward with more flexibility and great cheaper upgrades than most leading mobile providers!!! Take a hint and move on,0
"Vodafone are unprofessional, make fake promises and do not fulfill their final outcomes of complaint procedureI had a default on my credit file through no fault of my own, I was promised this would be removed back in December 2023 still is showing on my credit file and I have email confirmation that it was supposed to have been removedEvery time you ask for a manager call back or documents they don’t send relevant details or return your call!I HAVE PASSED THIS OVER TO THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN",0
"Hopeless. Installation of new broadband was supposed to happen 4 weeks ago but didn’t because it required 2 engineers to do the work. No contact from installation team since then, just pointless and time wasting phone calls every few days from a different department asking whether I’ve had an update. When I complained, my case was escalated, but still no action.Please don’t reply to this review with links to Facebook or  Twitter as I don’t do social media and I’m not chatting to a  chat bot either.  I just want a human being to contact me by phone or email with a date for when this installation will take place.Regarding reply from Vodafone below - As stated I don’t do social media 🙄. Generic computer generated response to all negative reviews I guess. Ho hum, back to SKY I Suppose",0
They customer service is ILLEGAL. I called them three times today and the results are:* Hanging up on me* Giving me wrong advice* Telling me my parcel is dispatched with DPD while DPD knows nothing about it.Thank you Vodafone fot being so RELIABLE!,0
"Got a fibre network with an advertised speed 400+ Mbps. That speed is hardly ever reached, but this isn't an issue. The issue is reliability of the service. The Internet drops off randomly during the day. Sometimes speed is 2 Mbps when sitting 30 cm away from the router. Being on the call you regularly get ""poor network quality"" message. Lately even watching online tv becomes jagged.",0
I've been a customer for long first 6 months. I had a good experience then became the worst customer service.I’m Waiting to end up contract this year. Then bye-bye to Vodafone forever. Customer service can’t say it’s worse ( Not experienced telephone advisor at all),0
"I think Vodafone is the most awful company I have ever felt with. I can’t even express how much pain and stress this company has caused me. How they treat their customers is vile. I have been trying to leave Vodafone for a month. I know I won’t be the only person having this trouble! I have spent hours on the phone to them getting me nowhere. Sending me around and around in circles. I’m on the app, following their directions finally to ‘switch to another network’ and that option is nowhere to be seen on my app. My whole family has had problems with them. Whatever you do DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! They will keep adding charges to your bill, they don’t listen to you, they pass your around to 100 different people on the phone and leave you feeling sick for the rest of the day and quite literally not let you leave the company. I thinks it’s absolutely disgusting how they have treated me and don’t want this to happen to someone else.",0
"I had a balance on my account which I requested to be credited into my bank account 5 weeks ago. I got back to them 4 times so far, and they finally credited a small amount of my balance. I am wondering how long it`s gonna take and how many times I have to get in touch with them until I get the total amount back. They treat customers as fools",0
"Vodafone internet broadband service is very unreliable. The service experiences network issues daily, at random times. Each event lasts ~3 min. This isn't enough time for the broadband service to ""catch"" the issue, and so they ignore it, saying that if they cannot spot it, they cannot report it. Previous recommendation I got from Vodafone under last negative review, was to contact the social media team. I did it today and they said it was a misunderstanding as they do not deal with such issues. Therefore, it's not only that the service is unreliable, and the technical help is bad, but also their own recommendations are misleading. It seems impossible to get connected with a competent member of their staff to have an issue addressed.",0
"Tried to join on the web, page said a problem so I called, firstly the Indian woman didn’t understand and I got cut off! She rang back so fair play, not understood again so passed me through to the new team! John who sounds like he’s eaten half of Newark was much help as a chocolate fire guard!! Went to get a manager. I got cut off again!! No call back.  The funny thing is I’ve not even joined yet and they are useless and secondly I was a magnet there and left cause they were crap. No improvement and I think I’ll join sky or virgin",0
"Last May, I intended to cancel my contract as I was leaving the UK to travel overseas. However, when I called to cancel, I was offered an alternative plan and assured that it would work globally.Initially, this seemed like a great deal. However, I later discovered that the plan has a restriction: after 90 days outside the UK, you can only use the data globally if you’ve spent more time in the UK than abroad. This was never explained to me at the time of purchase.This condition makes the plan completely unsuitable for me, as my sole reason for agreeing to it was to maintain my regular services while traveling. Now, I’m stuck paying £42 a month for a plan I cannot use, in addition to purchasing local SIM cards.I am deeply disappointed with the service I’ve received from Vodafone. After 15 years as a loyal customer, I will be canceling my contract as soon as it ends and will not be returning.If the plan could not be used overseas as a regular contract, it should never have been sold to me, and I should have been allowed to cancel my original contract without pressure or misrepresentation.",0
"Terrible ServiceIt took 2 months to connect and switch on the service, we did receive compensation but that came from BT not vodaphone.Since then I get 40mb at the TV and approx 130mb at our laptops if the 500mb were paying for and apparently it's NOT vodaphone that the problem it's all our equipment HaThey don't listen and haven't made any attempt to rectify the issue.After being fobbed off I looked at Sky and gave now received an email telling me I owe the £380 if I leave early. What a joke.Thanks further quick response but my review is based on my experience AFTER I've spoken with the technical team.",0
Left EE to go on a sim only plan which took 4 months and about 35hrs (yes no kidding) to get this sim connected after sending me 3 faulty sims out. I still paid for the 4 months I was waiting for sim to be connected.This company is better kept away from.,0
It has been a month which I have been trying to upgrade two mobile phones contract but no luck as Vodafone has an internal error that can’t be sorted in 30 days. Inconvenience it caused immense. Not even a star they deserve after these many years having three mobile contracts and broadband. I will be taking my business elsewhere.,0
"Shocking company! My sister has just rung them up to cancel our very ill mum's mobile phone contract (that she hasn't used for over a year) after losing my dad. We hoped that they may show some goodwill and refund some of her monthly amount invoices...........not a chance!! They cancelled her contract and offered nothing. Terrible, unsympathetic customer service.",0
"We have switched to Vodaphone Superfast Fibre. For some reason (CGNAT, IPv6 tunnelling and similar), this is blocked by Vodafone. The consequence is that we remotely cannot operate important apps remotely. The consequences are serious. Nobody seems to be able to help with this and Vodaphone are unresponsive. Not at all happy, should have stayed on copper wires with another provider. We now have to switch away. Wake up Vodaphone, get shot of those darn chatbots of yours and start sorting these issues. My advice to anyone is don't switch to Vodaphone as you'll waste your life being their beta testers.",0
"Absolutely awful, can’t get to speak to anyone that that awful txt service where they promise to do things and don’tThey said my direct debit was sorted and wasn’t. Diabolical I’ll be going elsewhere soon as this contract is done",0

"Appallingly incompetent customer service.  Have a business account plus opened a personal account, and was too difficult -- over 45mins on the phone...! -- to port a number within their own network.  For a while they tried to claim they couldn't even see the business number.  Then, after being transferred between at least 3-4 different people, the call disconnected.",0
"I've been with vodafone close to 20 years, For the past few years I've been paying for device plans and air plans for 3 people under my name. I tried to upgrade one of them at  the weekend but was denied after checking my credit profile.Even though I have asked more than once, they wont tell me exactly what the issue is, but after checking my credit profile there was a note on there to say that if you have 3 or more unsecured loans it can negatively impact your credit rating, so as I have 3 device plans under my name (mine, my partners and my sons) I can only but guess, that this was the problem. I don't have any other substantial loans, I don't have an overdraft and only have a small amount on my credit card (under £200). I would say my credit profile is ok from what I can see and the only thing that's stopping vodafone from renewing my device plan is their loans they gave me. 2 of the 3 device plans would be cleared upon the upgrade with just 1 remaining so don't see the issue?Another issue is they ask you to clear the device plan as the first bit of the upgrade process and then do the credit check for the new device plan, the credit check should be done first because now we have cleared the device plan (1 year remaining) and was going to use the trade in value for our old phone to offset it, but now out of pocket as the refuse to cancel the clearing of the device plan.I will be taking my business elsewhere after 20 years. taking every phone line and broadband away from them as I feel annoyed and let down that I am encouraged to scoop all mobiles and broadband under one account to get savings, but then my credit profile is at risk as I have multiple unsecured loans on my profile for all the devices on the account.If my partner and son managed their own mobile phones on their own account their device plan would be in their own name and be reflected on their own credit profile.*Bear the above in mind, when consolidating all your services!*",0

"Absolutely shocking that after 4 months of trying to get something very simple resolved. Nobody takes any notice, promises to call back do not happen, obstructive in contact, however, still send threatening emails. I will be sending all of the evidence of my contact to no avail over the last 4 months and Vodafone's inability to help and support their customer. Its ok for a customer to continue to try and get help and be put on hold time after time for a minimum of 15 minutes...still no resolution.",0

"Dear Vodafone Team,I recently moved back to Vodafone, believing it was the right decision, but I was sadly mistaken. Since rejoining at the end of December, my experience has been riddled with errors and frustrations.I have had to chase and call nearly every day, spending hours on the phone, which has caused immense stress, financial loss, and the inconvenience of being without a functioning phone or network.Here is a summary of the issues I have faced:1. Porting Failure: The porting process for my number has still not been completed, even after more than 14 days.2. SIM Issues: My original SIM was cancelled, a new SIM was issued, and yet there has been no resolution.3. Service Charges: I have been charged for a service that I have not been able to use.4. Network Unavailability: I have been left without network access, rendering my phone unusable.5. Lack of Communication: Neither AI nor customer service informed me that my order did not go through, leaving me in the dark.6. Poor Customer Service: Attempts to resolve these issues have been met with inadequate support, further adding to my frustration.This level of service is unacceptable and reflects poorly on Vodafone’s commitment to its customers.I feel deeply let down by the lack of efficiency and transparency in handling my case.I sincerely hope Vodafone can act quickly to resolve this matter and restore my trust in your services.Complaint reference: 126722239",0
Online customer service is awful. The purpose is to make resolving issues easier for people who may have access issues for phone or in person.You speak with a bot that is not very good at redirecting unless for basic issues. I also spoke with 3 different advisors who gave different advice to resolve an issue with the final one helping me only.,0

"I was fortunate to receive a free Vodafone SIM card for six months due to my financial situation. After that period, I signed up to continue with the same pay-as-you-go SIM for £10 a month. When I was able to upgrade, a cold caller informed me that I was eligible for a contract SIM, and I accepted the offer.Two weeks later, I received a text saying I qualified for a contract SIM that was now £20 cheaper. I was excited and decided to proceed with it. The representative assured me she would cancel my previous contract for the new one.However, I now find myself paying for two SIM cards because I have two contracts that, unfortunately, cannot be terminated until 2026 when both contracts expire.Happy New Year to you too!",0
Wishing I could turn the clock back. Switched broadband provider from Sky to Vodafone on 08 Jan. Openreach engineer set it up and explained it would be up and running within an hour. Three days and hours on the phone to Vodafone later still no service. Vodafone say there is a problem with the Openreach box. Openreach attended today and find absolutely no fault with the setup. They call Vodafone and tell them to resolve at their end. Totally clueless operator says it will work this time. No it didn’t. Three days without internet and I have no confidence that Vodafone know what they are doing and can actually fix the issue. Next step will be to cancel the contract and go back to Sky or A.N Other. I really do wish I could turn the clock back and wish I hadn’t fallen for Vodafone’s marketing hype and cheaper monthly contract.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with my experience with Vodafone over the past week following ""upgrading"" my mobile phone.After upgrading on 6th January the courier arrived on 7th and the driver claimed he didn't have the phone and then on the 8th they failed to deliver the phone (DPD strikes again) and then proceeded to return the parcel to Vodafone. Vodafone then received the mobile phone back to the warehouse and despite me being told they would simply send the phone out again they completely cancelled the order and will no longer honour the original deal. They have now unfortunately lost a customer. I was also looking to add additional plans for two of my children over the next two months but I will no longer be willing to do this.",0
"I confirmed a phone and sim package upgrade online and it stated I needed to call in person to confirm.The price was £10 for the sim 50GB Xtra (which should include roaming in 51 countries) and £24 for the phone contract.I called to confirm the order and they stated the sim contract did not include the EU roaming and it would be £14. And then phone contract would be £26. Seems like they’re secretly trying to make money. Biggest waste of multiple hours. I can’t comprehend how an order can be placed online, call to confirm and they quote a completely different price.",0
"got full fibre 900mbps but after every month of having the internet the speed got slower and slower and slower, i know they do this so they can save as much power as possible, so long story short if you get high download internet from vodafone they will make it slower overtime until you start complaining, mine is at 50-70 mbps max hasn’t went higher for atleast 6 months. i need to change internet but i work all week and don’t have time to call them as their customer service is horrendous so hard to even get through to anyone end of the day just don’t join vodafone if you need fast internet (i’m a gamer btw)",0
"I experience daily network outages, minimum once a day, sometimes more. Each of those outages lasts around 3 minutes. I contacted their technical support multiple times, but it's a waste of time. They do network status checks, which I can do myself via the app. They check network health, which I can do myself too. They say that they do not see any issue. Well, they will not see it, as the issue is intermittent. They also tell me to contact them when the issue occurs, not understanding that:1) When I lose network connection, I do not have the internet so cannot chat with them. I have no mobile data in the place I live.2) Issues are intermittent and for ~3 min - it takes longer for their chat-bot to figure out what to do with a case.Vodafone service is unreliable and their help or ""expert service"" recommendation seems like a token gesture. Their support say ""We do not see the issue now, we cannot report it"" - such an insightful observation, totally unhelpful though.",0
"Complete disaster.Signed up for full fibre top tear, changing from Virgin.Confirmed installation date, had texts from city fibre to confirm and all confirmed and less than 2 days after placing order random message that installation and account closed as my request....

Absolutely hate the customer servicewhen i closed my old vodafone account they put a S for settle on my credit agremeent even though it was paid on time and with no issues - they affected my credit rating.Secondly - i recently went back to Vodafone for broadband - i have WASTED the last hour trying to speak to a a human - took 45 minutes bouncing around from automated system their online system is TOTALLY useless aswell - didn't accept the security pin even though it was correct an verified.,0
"I have finally cancelled my Vodafone broadband after two years of terrible connection and even worse customer service. Long waiting call centre times, staff unable to understand or help with issues and one of the most expensive packages out there. The average call time is typically over an hour, frequently cutting out and having to call back several times for a basic request. Happy to move over to Community Fibre!",0
"DO NOT SIGN UP WITH VODAFONE. I have used them for 10 years plus. But recently their service has been extremely poor. Their broadband is either constantly down or slow. The customer service team do not help and refuse to find any solutions, leaving the customer stressed. This is unacceptable from a service provider I have been a long term customer with.",0
DONNOT EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING ANY CONTRACT WITH THESE SCAMMERS … ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS UOUR MONEY 💰 THEY DONT CARE ABOIT CUSTOMERS ORIENTATION. Nope 👎🏾 please Go for EE NETWORK THEY ARE WAY BETTER AND CHEAPER AND MORE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY 👌🏽,0
"Absolutely disgusting customer service!!!  Anyone thinking of taking out a contract with Vodafone please thing twice !!   They are trying to block me from having a contract with another provider by saying I want to switch to them, I only asked them what the deal was and they’ve told my provider I want to switch to them, which I never agreed any contact with them,  I spoke with a Zama a customer service agent who was so rude and refused to take me off the switch, I have not agreed a contract and they haven’t sent me anything, all I can say if you want to save yourself a lot of time and hassle as each time I ring they keep putting me on hold ( up to 1 hour a time)  use another provider!!",0
"City fibre installed the cables that was all ok, however when they tried to boot the router it wouldn't work.citt fibre are saying that the router is faulty and they spoke with Vodafone who will send another.i waited 24 hours for Vodafone to contact me about delivery but heard nothing from them. This is where it went really wrong, Vodafone customer service is really appalling,they are denying it's the router and are saying I have to wait four days for city fibre to sort it out. I was with the city fibre engineers when they spoke to Vodafone and I heard Vodafone say to the engineer that they would send a new router out to me but are now denying to me that they said that.i have spent two hours on the phone trying to sort it but they are insisting it's not there fault and that I have to wait four days for city fibre to respond.terrible customer service, I'm going to spend the weekend finding a different supplier,avoid Vodafone is my recommendation.",0
"Chose to switch to Vodafone from BT. Fibre broadband provided by City Fibre. Initial date was 16th Dec 2024. There was an issue with installing the fibre from my home to the cabinet due to a ducting fault outside my home. City Fibre (I have a separate review from them) said the fault would be fixed in a day or so. Didn't happen and when I contacted, I was told by City Fibre the date would be 7th Jan. Vodafone were aware of this via City Fibre but omitted to inform me. City Fibre although not a customer facing organisation did in fact provide me with this information via a real person - not Vodafone's extremely poor TOBi thing :(On 7th Jan, nothing had happened and I contacted City Fibre again to be told the new date was 10th Feb. Again Vodafone knew but simply didn't let me know. I wrote a negative review of City Fibre and they came today (16th Jan 2025) and seemed to have resolved the issue.Later today I received a message from BT that my service would be stopping. The Vodafone router still had not synced and had no internet. So I'm in a position where I could lose my working BT Broadband and have no Vodafone Broadband. Remarkably bad. Why turn off a working system when the replacement has not been verified. BT dropped this evening at 10pm, but a reboot seems to have brought it back for now - I'm using it to write this.So this ""One touch switch"" is worse than doing it yourself as at least that way you know you won't be without an important broadband connection.Oh, to use TOBi effectively, you need a PIN. You can't set the pin unless you activate your online account, which you can't do if the service isn't live. I'd love to see the test plan for that feature set. At least today, the third time I spoke to an adviser, I was told that they could set a PIN for me. Third time lucky.I look forward to Vodafone's response :)",0
Tell you you're eligible for upgrade then refuse to give you a new phone or even let you go withthem for home broadband after being a loyal customer and never missing a payment will be taking my business elsewhere,0
"Broadband!Don't bother, constant problems with it. Won't let you out of contract even when their internet won't work. Wasted hours on the phone to them. Have left us without WiFi for days. Disappointed as when buying mobile, they were helpful. Avoid Vodafone broadband.",0
"Hi Everyone,I have been using vodafone for past 12 years when it used to be the one of the best network even though expensive but i was happy because of quality of service they were providing as i don't want stress with signals. However, for past 1 year the quality of service went below then every other one,even with full signals 4g or 5g will disappear automatically while on whatsapp call then come back after wait. I spoke to the customer service to cancel or fix the issue but then they told me your contract is finishing in June and helped me fixing some stuff with internet in my mobile but still no improvement. I realise the ppl in my circle is facing same issue and thinking of moving from vodafone. Stay away from vodafone!!!",0
"So I thought they deserve another bad review. Spent 3 days last week being asked to change settings as I am still not getting the service I pay for. Needless to say nothing fixed it. There's no problem with our mast, they said. This arrived today Hello. Great news - we've fixed the problem with our mobile network in , which means everything should now be up and running again as normal. Sorry again for the disruption to your service, and thanks for your patience while we were getting things fixed. Still having trouble? Please get in touch with us free on 191 from a Vodafone mobile.Shame it still doesn't work. They know there service is rubbish because they won't even compensate me anymore or even take a complaint from me.Edit so tried Toby and X. I don't use anything else thanks for NO help whatsoever EE here I come.",0
"Worst customer service ever received. BT accidentally damaged the connection to my house. Spent a month trying to resolve, repeatedly being told to turn the router on and off and see if that works?!?!When i called to cancel, spent ages on the phone and had it completed. As with other feedback on here no cancellation was processed.Was told I’d be compensated for having no internet for a month. Guess what…..I don’t write reviews. The fact I’ve bothered here is a strong indication of why you should avoid any dealings with Vodaphone.",0
"Previously the last activation date was 6 December when an Open Reach engineer appeared but nothing happened! Another activation date was set for today 3 January - same result - the Open Reach engineer appeared but nothing has happened!! I will now have to wait a further 4 weeks at least. That is 3 months to get connected since I signed my deal! And I have absolutely no confidence that anything will happen then either.I want ACTION not empty promises from Vodafone who are are full of fine empty words which, frankly, are just LIES. I can't even phone them as all I get is a pre recorded message and then they terminate the call!!! I wish I had never agreed to switch providers.",0
"Worst service ever, I waited for 3 months for them to repair my phone, and they failed to do it, they replaced it with a shit phone and lied about it.",0
"Went into Winchester store today (11/01/2025) shop was empty, first staff member who was on his phone looked up and passed us onto another member of staff as he clearly couldn’t be bothered with us. Second member of staff sat us down, we explained we wanted to upgrade my wife’s phone from an IPhone 6 as we were still paying £41 per month for an old phone, so wanted to upgrade and reduce monthly.  After 10 mins of I don’t know what he was doing, we were told we could get a iPhone 14 for £52 per month…..sorry, did you not hear what we wanted to do? Asked him if there were any other options…..yes, we could get a refurb phone!!!! I have a new iPhone 13 with Tesco mobile with unlimited everything for £30 per month…..  when I said that we would not be doing an upgrade and will therefore be leaving the store AND Vodafone, he shrugged his shoulders, said nothing and we left. No customer service, no smiles, no help in trying to find the right product at the right price….Vodafone, sack them, there are enough people around that would love to work and give a decent experience to your customers.  From a now FORMER Vodafone customer of over 20 years…",0
Once again charged for out of plan for something I did not use.Stay away from Vodafone. Once I am home I will be looking for a new phone and broadband service.,0
My wife purchased a new phone from a Vodafone shop yesterday. We have discovered today that a member of staff posted a review without our knowledge. We find this behaviour appalling and should not be allowed by Vodafone.Please let us know what action you will take to ensure this sort of thing doesn't happen again,0
MIS SOLD AIR TIME CONTRACT. I was having difficulty using my phone abroad and called for help. While on the phone the advisor said he could make my air time contract cheaper. I was reluctant to do this as I only had 3 months to go on the current one and wanted to change provider. He assured me that I can cancel any time with no charge. I twice questioned this and was told yes I can cancel any  time no cost. On phoning to get a PAC code I was told it will cost me £245 to leave. I asked if they could check the call to see that I was told no charge. Yes they record calls. No they don't have mine. Yes I still have to pay to leave. No they won't budge. I have had 5 contracts with Vodafone for about 15 years. So next step for me is a complaint to Offcom and to trading standards,0
"I ported my network to other network and I was initially told ill get full refund which is there in my vodafone account, but unfortunately today when I called for refund 5% cancellation fees were applied which was very annoying, it seem whenever yhe provider wants they get different policy in place as per situation and never advice before.Shame and I would never recommend anyone for vodafone.I did not had any contract it was pay as u go i have to recharge bundle every month",0
"So so bad !! Especially the manager Leonard no way … he doesnt know to talk to customers only shouting and no helping . Just to get the sim ı had 3 days and still no solution .. never going to this shop again, the way of talking is so bad…..😡😡😡",0
"Moved house, told it would be fine and all set up. 3 days later after activation date I have no internet and every advisor I speak to has a different excuse why and tells me to wait and it will come on. I haven't been able to work and have lost money because of this, apology offer from Vodafone for 2 days lost income and no internet with no end in sight? £6. AVOID!",0
"Signed up to broadband in October, the engineer didn’t ask where I’d like the cable to run. The cable looked ridiculous and I asked them to remove it for that reason, the neighbour complained it was on her property and the fact it had damaged my 3 month old render. Refused to do anything about it so cancelled after 3 days. I’m now receiving debt collection letters for £60. Would be laughable if I wasn’t about to remortgage and wasn’t ignored by the complaints department. See you in court Vodafone.",0
The customer service was very rude and unprofessional.i have  being using mobile and WiFi connection to my residence for so many years but when i wanted to get my prepaid existing number change of my daughters to monthly plan the agent dint even care to offer me the packages instead trying to promote me a new number once. I scanned the qr for customer feedback his total actions change and was more friendly.but I still don’t want to complain but had to now after even so many times requesting for the same number to be activated he has just activated a new number when we put the new SIM card by the agent.i expected more better customer service from this outlet.,0
"I am moving house and have so far spent over an hour trying to get through to someone on the helpline. The line then cuts me off.  They are now going to ring me back at 17:00 today. For a process that should be simple as alluded to online, this has so far been a nightmare with the robot chat sending me round in circles. I will update if we are successful with our change! Seriously thinking of changing providers.",0
"I ordered my broadband 3 weeks ago. Despite getting several messages confirming the installation today 7 January 2025, nobody pitched up. I was quite clear to the person signing me up that they would have to send an engineer to do the installation as there is a loose fibre wire lying here and not connected to anything. I took a days unpaid leave to make sure that I would be home to let them in and I have the router connected as much as I can according to their instructions but nobody turned up. I phoned in to Vodafone and I was told that they would have to get an engineer in, which I told them 3 weeks ago and they confirmed that, but the engineer would only be here in 10 days, so I lost today's pay and now they say I must take another day off and wait for the engineer to come. I subsequently cancelled the order and now it is up to me to return their hardware.  Why can these big companies not just do what they say. Back to the drawing board for me",0
"Worst experience I have had as a customer. I paid every bill on time.I left Vodafone several months ago for another Internet provider and was refunded an amount I was owed a couple of months after the account closure. I have not had any communication from Vodafone since until receiving a letter today to state they have sent me to a collection agency for £19.98, leaving a default record with the credit agency!! From a quick look online I am not the first they have done this to and clearly don't care enough to fix whatever issue is causing them to send prior customers to a collection agency for no reason.",0
So slow it spoilt our TV viewing new years eve. Did the Vodafone checks which just confirmed the signal to be very unstable and only achieving 6Mbs.Can't be relied upon.Will contact City Fibre as Vodafone don't take any responsibility.,0
"Update: Its 2025 and since Christmas my vodafone speed has dropped to under 100mbps when I should be getting 700-900mbps. I haven't changed anything or connections is just suddenly started doing this. Of course this is not the first time, in the past engineers have been out and not been able to fix it. £36 per month for this crap is daylight robbery, they never reimburse you either. Trying to get help means you have to sign in here and there and passwords never work that's why I gave up with their stupid app which is another piece of garbage. I've never used it since my last review. Update:11th Jan 2025 I received a text message to re register my account, I went there then got told my accounts been locked temporary. I've already waited 48 hours to hear that. I am still getting less than 90mbps instead of at least 700 with my paid for 900mbps speed account. Really annoyed to say the least as I know they wont re emburse me for all this time wasting and crap service because its happened in the past so many times and I was never compensated.",0
"Customer Service is SHOCKING!I understand that companies often choose to outsource their customer service functions, but Vodafone has become unbearably difficult to deal with when problems arise. For me, a truly great company is defined by how it resolves issues, not by its sales tactics—and Vodafone is falling far short in this regard.I’ve been passed from one representative to another, from South Africa to India and everywhere in between. None of the representatives I’ve encountered seem empowered to truly empathize or assist; instead, they simply repeat the same scripted responses over and over again like robots.Getting through to someone—whether by phone or their chat system—takes an eternity. To make matters worse, I was just four days late on a payment, and yet I’ve been bombarded with threatening emails and texts, even warnings about debt collectors. Four days! This level of response is excessive and unwarranted.What on earth has happened to Vodafone? If I could leave today, I absolutely would.",0
"As an existing broadband customer I assumed it would be easy to add a couple of sim only mobile plans, how wrong I was! Thought it would be easy using the live chat, After wasting my time with the useless digital assistant, was supposedly transferred to chat with an actual person, ended up in a queue , and eventually just gave up . Totally useless !",0
Dreadful broadband experience with pro 2 boosters. they are not proper mesh and dont work well. vodafone helpdesk even advised to turn them all off every few days to prevent them overheating. I cancelled within 14 days (they also would not follow the terms of their own contracts to allow me to leave between day 14 and day 30 as per their terms for pro broadband. be warned!!!!!,0
Vodafone is the worst mobile phone company had to deal with. Cancelling contract to a different provider is not straight forward will never ever use Vodafone in the future. Changing my daughter's contract was a nightmare getting money out of you after changing to a different company. Vodafone don't deserve one star surprised the staff putting up with their stupid rules.,0
"Terrible online portal that never works or accepts payments. You are then charged a late payment fee, even though you have no access to your account online to pay. You are then disconnected and once you pay you are not re-connected immediately. In fact its been 4 hours since payment and no connection. No support, can't log in to the account portal. No humans to rectify the problem.Terrible network with no support and crap cell coverage.",0
"Third time chasing up compensation for broadband loss for 8 days (20/10/20).Apparently no UK call centre, only a bot service (TOBi) a chat line to I am assuming India. Three times I have explained the problem, besides having to read through previous conversations the guys there try to help.All I can say about Vodaphone Broadband is that when it works it works well. Have a serious fault with that service and require help, turn to a wall and talk to it !!!.",0
"Am more than three weeks into a nightmare with Vodafone routers restarting by themselves and cutting me off in the middle of important work meetings.I have serious health issues and have to work from home with Vodafone having caused incredible stress and worsening of my health due to their appalling technical service.Vodafone broadband technical help desk support staff are super nice and follow up on calls but are following scripts like computers and are obviously trained to deflect from the actual faults with Vodafone equipment and have no technical training .Instead of getting advanced technical support to investigate why their routers restart by themselves on a regular basis they keep blaming the network, and my electric connections, which Openreach engineers, which Vodafone sent can show me clearly are working.I now had disrupted work and endless stress since before Christmas with no compensation, no alternative solutions provided by Vodafone and no resolution to the problem with their routers.Will continue to post updates.17/01/25 - Vodafone just admitted on a recorded call with me that they don't have engineer support for their service, and refuse to replace the faulty router the sent me. Appalling service. Will be looking for alternatives and will continue posting updates on my ongoing nightmare with them. Vodafone forum is full of complaints of their routers resetting themselves so demand routers being replaced until they get to you one what works.18/01/25 - router restarted at least half a dozen times yesterday  losing internet connectivity and again several times this morning and it is only 07:00. This is a ""new"" router Vodafone provided earlier in the week. Obvious headway and software problem with their routers they refuse to admit",0
"This review is not for any specific individual offering new contracts. Vodafone loves new contracts, however transparency and maintaining loyal customers is a different matter. I travelled to France and Spain for 10 days 8 of those were Roaming charges in excess of £300 pounds! Never offered a bundle but only a message that I had used ‘too many Gigs’ what on earth is a gig I asked and could not receive an answer.I wasn’t taught in school what data usage amounts to a Gigs nor did I receive any messages from Vodafone each time I had used a Gig. The only time I was told that was when I received a message from them that my next bill would be £330! My monthly agreement was £39 per month so a bill over £300 was a shock. Customer service while abroad couldn’t be reached because they had also cut off my wifi, so no way of contacting anyone including Vodafone, who sent me messages but couldn’t respond. Vodafone completely ruined my vacation. After 15 years with the firm the best thing I’ve done is leave them for another provider. A reminder that when you’re told ‘unlimited’ on your agreement from Vodafone, it really means limited and any additional charges most likely be more than an annual contract. Another example of corporate greed.",0
Vodafone have associated an incorrect phone number to my account and will therefore not allow me to access it online or via the phone. I fear the only way around this is simply to leave the company as despite answering half a dozen other security questions they refuse to allow access to the account.,0
"Reported a complaint told response time would be 72 hours that was 3 weeks ago and still waiting when an agent told me registered blind, disabled and housebound customer to pop down to my local store to get help talk about rude and discriminatory behaviour is that Acceptable ?The reply I got was reach out to our social media team what part of  BLIND  did Vodafone not get?????",0
"18 months of a terrible service.... Constant dropouts. Enough said, never again.",0
"The worst customer service experience of my life!!!!Long story short I received a notification about an outstanding balance on my device plan on the 10/1/2025 which paid immediately.After I'd made  the payment and contacted Vodafone, they advised me after 20 +minutes going through the same information that the payment would take 24 hours to update.However, on 16 January 2025,my phone service was barred. Despite 13 attempts to contact the free customer service number, being left on hold and also having the phone disconnected by Vodafone, the issue remained unresolved.The customer service team said I'd failed to pay the outstanding balance of £21.00 even though I have photographic evidence (screenshots from my banking app) that I offered to email them. Said customer service advisors informed me that Vodafone don't have an email address??? Unlikely don't you think?  I told one of the customer service advisors that my mental health has severely been affected by this as I have been going through a very difficult time at the moment, due to being in temporary employment and the added pressures of the financial impact this has had on me. I have ADHD and its proven very difficult to find a permanent role.To which I was greeted with radio silence from the advisor and a very patronising and uninterested tone. They do say if you want a job doing do it yourself and so I spent yesterday afternoon having to visit my bank for payment details and then a Vodafone store to resolve the issue, because the customer service advisors left me on hold. The whole situation caused me to leave work early because the stress and constant pressure made it impossible to concentrate at work and as a result I lost 4 hours pay.If I hadn't visited my bank or the Vodafone store yesterday, my phone would most likely still be blocked due to no fault of my own.The lack of empathy, professionalism and respect is absolutely disgraceful and I dread to think how many customers have to put up with this.I'm lucky that I have the support of friends and family, but for customers who are alone, and in severe mental or financial difficulty, an experience like this could really drive them to despair. I got a robotic, lacklustre response to my complaint with £10 Compensation against my next bill! Such an insult. I'm looking forward to July 2025 when my contract ends and I can leave Vodafone for good.Absolutely shocking service, received and to be penalised for actually paying your bill is beyond a joke. I would avoid Vodafone at all costs!!",0
"Setting up a new broadband account and it got cancelled. Then the new one was agreed to be set up on the 10th Jan as requested. However, all emails now say the 17th, after speaking to customer services again they cannot help me and no one shared that this was going to be the date. Really let down",0
"On the 1st of January, I bought a Vodafone sim card for a mobile phone with 40GB pay as you go. The next day, I called them to get a refund of my £20 because the Internet connection was weak and constantly breaking. They told me that because of ""government works to improve something in my area, the Internet is weak to the end of January."" I asked for the manager but they never contacted me. Nobady else in Vodafone could find anything about ""government working in my area"" when l called them again on the 5th of January.Under the Consumer Protection Act of 2015, l should get back my money if the product doesn't work.The CEO and management of Vodafone seems to believe that my £20 is very important to the existence of the company.Meantime I tried SMARTY, which has very competitive offers, but sadly, their Internet had the same problem. SMARTY's friendly and professional customer service very quickly refunded my money.",0

"I’ve been a Vodafone customer for years, but my recent experience has been incredibly disappointing. I have a SIM-only contract and was paying £11.44 last year. For the first time, I considered other providers because I was worried about running out of data and paying extra for roaming abroad.I visited the Vodafone store in Derry and spoke to customer service on the phone. I was reassured that a new deal would meet my data needs, so I stayed as a loyal customer. Unfortunately, the new deal didn’t provide enough data, so I had to increase it. Even after doing that, it still wasn’t enough, and I had to increase my data again. I’m now paying £16.20 per month, and most months I still run out of data.I’ve been back to the store and called customer service several times, but the only solution they offer is to add 1GB of data per month for an additional £7.25. This would bring my total to £23.45 for only 9GB of data and no roaming—far worse than deals available from other providers.My last visit to the Derry store was the worst. The representative was argumentative and unhelpful. I feel I was mis-sold this contract, and now I’m stuck with it until March 4, 2026.Avoid Vodafone! Their promises don’t match reality, and they don’t seem to value loyal customers.",0
"Further to the response to my earlier feedback, I can confirm that I have been liaising with Vodafone on X. However, it takes 20 minutes plus to get a response to the 'chat / DM' feature - which means it's far from user friendly.Example: ""Please explain the problem."" You do. 20 mins later a response.""Please confirm your tel number"" You do. 20 mins later a response.""Please can I have digit 1 and 4 from your security code"". You supply this. 20 mins later a response.Makes it challenging to have a coherent set of comms in any sensible timeframe.",0

I'd been with EE for two decades or more and decided to switch. What a big mistake. Vodafone is a kafkaesque nightmare. Even the complaint form produces a 404 error.  Nó attempt at remedy works. Really regret trying themPs I did as they suggested and dm'ed via Twitter but have heard nothing back,0
"I have been waiting for an installation date since I placed the order on 11/10/24 every time i speak with an advisor they tell me it will be done in 5 days obviously not as still waiting .i have just been advised the end of January must have given up on the 5 days spiel .problem is they are quick enough to cancel your existing broadband of which I cannot now cancel parts of my package and is costing me monthly for stuff I don’t use ,sky were delighted to tell me this as they continue to take money from me and advised if it takes 12 months they will continue to rob me for 12 months.so don’t use Vodafone as they will keep giving false information and to cancel all previous contracts personally to save yourself a lot of money.",0
"Made a mistake myself and husband but then the nightmare unleashed. We signed up whilst we were renovating the new house and instead of changing the dates for the installation, we cancelled the contracts within those 14 days. Recently, when we wanted to re-join, they messed up our credit check badly. Just so you are aware, once you've cancelled the contract with them, you'll be rejected 90 days afterwards if you want to re-join - it will say your credit check failed. I spoke to them via phone, chat and they sent me to Experian and once I opened a claim with them about my credit check, Experian raised a dispute with Vodafone and told me it was sorted. But no, it wasn't and also will block you from joining other suppliers online, where you can get the best prices and offers because your data will stay stuck on their system and the one of Open Reach so you will have more issues. It can be sorted but you have to pay a lot more for another provider to take over. And the messages and communication received from them were very misleading. I feel so sorry I made such a big mistake to deal with them, at my father's recommendation who's been with Vodafone Romania for over 20 years. Yesterday evening I spent 2 hours over the phone until Kelly managed to re-activate my account and that got me a massive headache which is still ongoing today. And that at a higher price than you find online. I understand I made a mistake but be careful because they do not specify all the unleashed mess which starts if you decide to cancel within 14 days, as per the consumer's rights and will cause you so much stress. If I manage to sort it with another provider, I will cancel it forever and tell to all the people I know to be aware and stay away from Vodafone. I got the best ""deal"" yesterday over the phone. 25£ for 150mgb when online you can buy it at 24£ plus a 90£ voucher. But they blocked me from being able to purchase it online...",0
"Worst company to deal with , I top up my phone to call 09083264512 and they restricted my access to that number , top of that I ve been on webchat for a refund 3 days and they couldn t process it after they confirmed I am eligible for it . The guy who I spoke with on the webchat doesn t have a clue how to do his job, I understand they hire cheap labour but at lest train them properly",0
"I wish I never gave any mind to Vodafone. I’ve only ever had broadband routers from them. My first router did not give me the speeds promised. Customer service is shocking, almost always you get connected to somebody in India with poor language. This time I have a 12 month contract with Vodafone, I have been overcharged since I started the contract 4 months ago, when I try to call Vodafone to resolve this, this is how it goes: I ring, they answer in India, I explain that they are overcharging me, that I have email proof for the £29 agreed, they tell me that all they can see on their screen is £39 which is what they are charging me. I tell them I can send them proof if they have email or if they screen share or send me a link to upload the screenshot of my email. They tell me that they will ask they’re manager to cal me, they’re manager at first didn’t, so I had to start all over again, they’re manage finally calls me and long story short, he can not do anything, he says he could only send me a link if I have a Vodafone mobile, his language is very poor, he confirms he is in India, he does not have the power to pass me to somebody in the UK and does have the power to resolve my issue. In the end he gives me Vodafone’s website address and asks me to chat to the team and upload my screenshot to them, I did laugh because it was that or cry. I asked why as a manger all he can do, is read out Vodafone’s website address. That was that, he wasn’t going to help no matter how hard I tried. I clicked the link and I am greeted with, HEY ITS TOBI THE ROBOT ASSISTANT, HOW CAN I HELP? Honestly this is the worst company ever and I will never use Vodafone again. Please be warned everybody. Use a local business or one like BT where at least you will be connected to real people and people in the uk 🇬🇧.",0
"I used the self-service option to request the porting of two numbers into Vodafone on the 13th and 14th of December. It has now been nearly a month, and the numbers have not been ported. To make matters worse, neither the original Vodafone numbers nor the ported-in numbers are working.I have attempted to resolve this issue through your online chat service, but the chatbot refuses to transfer me to a human agent. I have also called multiple times without success. This situation is unacceptable, and I am now considering reporting the matter to OFCOM.Vodafone has lost my numbers in the porting process, and they are now stuck somewhere in your system. This issue needs to be resolved immediately, as I will not tolerate any further delays.This matter needs to be prioritised and demand that a swift remedy is assured.Can someone respond to my complaint so that I can provide all the details to get this mess sorted.I made a big mistake choosomg to port into Vodafone. I now regret itI don't use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, so please provide an email address to contact you.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with Vodafone's service and their complete lack of professionalism. They agreed to install my internet on September 10th, but never showed up. Since then, they have rescheduled the installation six separate times, each time with little notice and delays of up to 30 days.Each time I called to confirm that everything was in place, they reassured me that they were ready to go, only for the installation to be cancelled again the day before it was supposed to happen. This has caused immense frustration and inconvenience, and it's clear that Vodafone has no regard for their customers’ time or commitments.If you are looking for reliable service and a company that actually values your business, I strongly advise you to avoid Vodafone. Their incompetence and terrible customer service have left me completely dissatisfied.UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO REPLY FROM VODAFONE: They've asked me to contact them on socials as a token gesture to appear people reading this review but they've ignored me there too. Horrific service.",0
"I am writing to formally raise a complaint about the exceptionally poor service I have received, particularly from the Milton Keynes branch, as a loyal Vodafone customer of 10 years. The series of issues I have faced over the past several months has been incredibly frustrating, time-consuming, and ultimately unresolved.I initially began experiencing service issues in August 2024, when I had no access to my phone for two weeks. Due to work commitments in a different city, I was unable to address the issue immediately. Upon returning, I visited the MK branch, where I was told that the problem was caused by an old SIM card. However, despite the fact that the account is in my name and the phone belongs to me, I was informed that no action could be taken because my father pays for the service. My father, who is 68 years old and suffers from dementia, Parkinson’s, and poor mobility, is unable to leave the house easily. Even after explaining this, the staff at the MK branch offered no apology or assistance, and I was sent away without a resolution.The following week, I had no choice but to bring my father into the store in a wheelchair to update the account and receive a new SIM card, which should have been done in the first place. This issue was somewhat resolved for a short period, but in December 2024, my service dropped once again, this time for a more extended period.On December 28, 2024, my service dropped again and did not return. I returned to the MK branch, where I was told that the issue was hardware-related, not the SIM card. I was assured by both Sunny and another store manager that I would not incur any charges for repairs, and it was suggested that I return in the new year to send off the phone for repairs, as this would be quicker.I returned on January 7, 2025, to send the phone off for repair. I was assisted by Avril, who seemed unsure of the process and stated that she ""wasn’t very good at this."" After some assistance from the store manager, I was informed that my warranty had expired just a week prior to my visit. I inquired if there was any possibility of disputing the repair charges, as I had previously visited the store within my warranty period, and was assured by Sunny that everything would be handled, and I should not worry. However, the interaction felt rushed and dismissive, especially as the store was nearing closing time.On January 17, 2025, I received my phone back in the mail, still broken, along with a letter stating that the repair could not be completed due to the warranty expiry. The letter also mentioned that they had attempted to contact me, but I have not received any emails or messages regarding this matter. This is entirely unacceptable. I am now left without a working phone and still being billed for the service.I am deeply dissatisfied with the entire process, the lack of communication, and the ongoing inconvenience this has caused. I have invested a significant amount of time visiting the store, engaging in live chats, and speaking on the phone, only to be left with no resolution and no confidence in the repair process. I was assured multiple times that this issue would be resolved, but I am now at square one, with no solution in sight.As part of the resolution to this matter, I would appreciate a full refund for the two-week period in August 2024 when I had no access to my phone, as was initially promised. Additionally, I request that this issue be escalated to ensure a proper resolution, including repair or replacement of my phone at no cost, given the ongoing nature of the problem and the significant delays caused by Vodafone's lack of communication and support.Please consider this letter a formal complaint. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will be forced to take further action, including escalating the complaint to the relevant regulatory bodies. Should this issue be resolved, please be assured that I will be discontinuing my relationship with Vodafone after 10 years of service.I look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely,Chloe MayockAnthony Mayock",0
"We had to call up to get to grips with my Dad's vodafone contracts as he has brain cancer and we're getting his affairs in order.From start to finish, over the course of about an hour of attempting to gain an understanding of his payment commitments and agreements with vodafone, we found ourselves utterly none the wiser due to painfully unclear communication from the agent, who repeatedly insisted on gaining agreement from my Dad for my mother and myself to be granted insight despite having apparently satisfactorily achieved this early on and my Dad being fatigued and experiencing difficulty talking. (He was twice put on the line to the agents satisfaction, but this ultimately wasn't good enough).As we had to ask for clarity over and over, the agent eventually became noticably annoyed and snippy and we were ultimately passed on to another department whom he failed to sufficiently advise of the situation, so we were once again asked to put my Dad on the line which I refused to do.I was declined the opportunity to complain to a senior and instead fobbed off to their website, but guess what, I've ended up here.All we wanted to know was what services his direct debits to vodafone were for. We still don't know.The experience was exhausting and agonising.Dreadful.",0
Terrible service.  Only had their broadband 4 days and it’s gone off at least once a day in them 4 days.  Called support and he wanted me to start unscrewing the wall panel and using tech language,0
"Broadband constantly getting disconnected, impossible to use, it got disconnected four times in the last couple of months. They don’t send engineers to sort out the problem, tell you to wait for 48 hours, useless.",0
Before Christmas I contacted Vodafone about my monthly bill. My bill had my old address even after updating and confirming my new address. I got my monthly bill amount and decided to make an early payment on the 13th December. I didn't want any issues in the same month especially during the festive period so I made the payment so I could get it out the way. Right after Christmas they took out a direct debit for the month and not only that I had to learn the bill was not correct with a £29 overcharge and they missed out the device costs when I requested the bill amount for the month.,0
Absolutely shoddy.. I’ve been with Vodafone for over 20 years and never had a problem until now… I can’t stop the contracts at the minute because I unknowingly started a new 2 year contract in November for my daughter by just uping her data.. when I also asked at the same time if I can change her phone into her name when she was 18 which was 4 weeks after uping her data’s… I was told yes I could .. I now can’t change her phone into her name because the new contract doesn’t run out till November 2026 unless I pay a cancellation fee... like I said I didn’t know that uping data would start a new contract.. also my bill has upped significantly with added airtime payments.. not only do I pay £120 a month added airtime payments are also added on which ups my bill by an extra £50+ ontop.. as soon as all the contracts I have are finished I’ll be changing phone company… absolutely shoddy and I’m so angry about going into a new contract by only uping data,0
"Poor data dongle with little justification for the £38/month.Also hard to understand how is Trustpilor pulling the 4.5 stars, with 34% of reviews of 1 Star, 1% with 2 Stars and 1% with 3%. Anyone with basic arithmetics would calculate 3.4 Stars…..",0
"Should have had Open reach engineer on 12/12 to install Vodafone Router. Didn't turn up and there was no prior notice or contact made. I contacted them next day but earliest new date 27/12. OR engineer came on 27/12, set up Router (or so he said) but said Vodafone had to activate the line so waited up until past midnight. No joy - no internet and no lights on Router except flashing red led on the front. Contacted Vodafone and followed instructions to try and remedy. Still no joy. He said he'd report it to The Back Office (?) as it seemed that Router was duff. He called phone on 30/12 to say there was further investigation to be done but if  new Router needed, it would take another 3 to 5 working days! I wish I'd never heard of Vodafone. No internet, no WiFi, no central heating, no TV entertainment, no contact via video to family for Christmas or New Year and we are 75 and 81 years old. I guarantee they wouldn't put their own grandparents through this and would make a supreme effort to put it right as soon as possible. Customer care? I don't feel it. 😔",0
Been trying to transfer number to a new  account.  Had conflicting instructions for two days. Hard to get the operator to what needs to happen back at square one again.,0
I bought 2 mobile phone's on contract. They offered me insurance which I can cancel within 14days. I managed to cancel the insurance but they blacklisted my 2nd phone without notifying me.

Lucas his very amazing coustmer service I we’ll give him  100%I well came recommended to me Frends,0
Very unhappy with the customer service I have receivedI ran out of data and bought 1 GB to tide me over on my trip to London with my young childI noticed I had 2 charges on the bill - i rang and asked for the charge to be removed for the extra data and advisor removed the data I had boughtI then explained I wanted the data I had bought but I didn’t want the future charge for data and the advisor refused to put back the data back on as said I had asked for it to be removed which wasn’t the caseCommon sense surely would be for the advisor to question why I would ring up one day and agree to pays for an extra G of data to then ring back the next day and ask for it be removed 😡I spoke with a manager called Jacob and he again refused to put the date I had paid for back on and said if he did they would charge me againLeaving me in London with no data to get the maps working with a young child,0
"The worst experience ever. A lot of lies, extreme unprofessionalism and I can't even make any sense of their actions. I informed them that I need to stop my contract on the 24/07/2024 as I'm moving to another country.They kept me on the contract. Then I got a notice in October for a sudden disconnection. I wish they stopped the contract at that time.As I don't have access to my account, I can check all this only via my bank account... As I left the country permanently. The Vodafone app doesn't allow me to log in n requires the use of SIM as verification which is an invalid SIM. So even if I want to pay, there is no way. Except if I make an international call...On the 11/2024 they moved me to pay as you go and on the 01/2025 I saw that they sent two monthly bills for November n December! Unbelievable...They kept the contract going again... As I live now in another country, you can still keep sending me letters and you can still keep sending me text to a number that doesn't exist! The only thing that works is the email.On the 12/2024 they told me that I m moving to pay as you go and then on the 01/2025 they sent me the monthly bill.All this whilst I lost my credentials in the app from 08/2024! I don't have access to my account!Still on the 20th of January, whilst I don't have access to my account, no SIM card, the employees are incapable of terminating my contract.",0

"First, I filled out all the info on the website, and everything seemed okay; after hitting the ""Submit order"" button, I was redirected to a screen with a message saying that it might take ""up to 2 minutes."". 30 minutes later, it was still showing the same message. I contacted their support via chat, and they advised me to try again. So..., I tried again. I went to the final order confirmation screen and hit submit, but it got stuck again.I contacted the support again; TOBi (their ""AI"" chat) asked the same questions repeatedly, clearly losing all context from the previous session. Eventually, I connected to a super helpful agent who offered to create the account and manually sign me up for the broadband. It took forever, but we worked through all the details, verified my ID, did the credit check, and agreed to all the contractual details. Then, just as we were about done, the chat just disconnected. No message, no error. Just nothing,Reloaded the screen, only for a chat to start all over again. TOBi is pretty retarded, asking the same circuitous questions... Eventually, I got connected to a new agent. I asked if I could be transferred back to the previous agent and was told they couldn't do that. Had to answer all the security questions all over again (despite being logged in to the account at this point!)Long story short, the new agent said I'd have to start the whole process again, verify my ID, provide all my details, do a credit check, etc. At this point, I just said, ""No, thank you."" By this point, I had been trying to sign up for broadband for three hours, and I reached my limit. The agent was thankfully understanding, but yeah...I went with Plusnet. It literally took me 5 minutes to sign up, create an account, and transfer from my current provider. Amazing.",0
"My Vodafone broadband over time became extremely sluggish and I contacted Vodafone to find out the cause and I was told I was still on some old copper wire. As my home could not get full fibre, I was then sold a partial fibre upgrade which was meant to significantly improve the performance and Vodafone gave an assurance I would get a guaranteed minimum speed of 50Mbps download and about 18Mbps upload. Given I was getting less than 10Mbps on the copper line, I signed up for the upgrade. Post the upgrade, the performance is still the same. I am now trying to get the upgrade cancelled as I am still inside of the 14 days cooling off period but Vodafone customer service just keep passing me around from one team to another for such a simple cancellation request. The customer service is beyond a joke!",0
2 hours and 4 minutes on the phone to change my plan.  After 1 hr 50 mins they tell me unfortunately they can’t do it on the phone but I can do it online.  Stay on the phone I say and talk me through… 15 mins later they agree I can’t do it online.  Apparently someone will call me back now… I despair … 2 hours of my day wasted!!!!!!!!,0
"Unless you are prepared to take out a contract (very poor value for money) I would give Vodafone a wide berth. I took out a PAYG sim with them with a view to changing to pay monthly and was unable to upgrade to a contract when the 'great value' contracts they offered were impossible to access. Changed providers and was due a refund. Of course, they didn't want to pay out and after claiming I would be refunded, I had to chase them up when the refund failed to materialise. One hour of wasted time later, I was told they had 'ordered a refund'...so what did they do in the first place? I'll believe the refund when I see it. Poor customer service and treat their PAYG customers like garbage. Will never use this company again.UPDATE: As expected, the usual bog-standard reply pretending that they care. They don't. Already wasted my time 'reaching out' to you and I'm not going to waste more time doing it again. Just enjoy your rubbish review and hopefully it will put some people off using your dreadful service.",0
"Absolutely disgraceful company.I’ve been a loyal customer for 10 years.Wound down my contracts and paid them off. Switched to another provider.September had a missed payment. Affected my credit score. Phoned up. Yes our mistake we will take it off. October again missed payment on my credit report. Phoned again. Again there fault. This time I’m told I over paid. We will take it off. It came off, thinking all good. (Even though my credit score had not been restored to it’s original score)Then this morning again a missed payment.There are no words. Avoid this company. Nothing but lies to get you off the phone.If only there was no stars to give.",0
"Absolutely horrendousFor many years (20+) I’ve had my main contract phone, various business contracts and a tiny contract exclusively for use on my electric gates (which have a SIM card inside them).Having recently moved house, I needed to cancel the contract attached to the sim in the gates. Unfortunately, as it was set up many years ago and given the simple requirements, I have no idea what the pin is for the SIM card and am unable to receive messages sent to it as it’s in the gates at my precious home.Vodafone have made it completely impossible for me to cancel the contract and continue to take money from my account for a service I haven’t used for months and do not want any more. It’s impossible to get through on the phone and when I eventually did, they told me I needed to go into a store, which I explained was a massive inconvenience. Well, guess what, I’ve just been into a store who explained they can’t cancel the contract in store. He insisted on me trying to call from the store so he could potentially speak to them, but as ever, it’s impossible to get through. So I’m now completely stuck and apparently if I cancel the DD Vodafone will pass onto debt collectors and this will affect my credit record.Unbelievable",0
"Their customer service is a nightmare, with endless waits, they never understand the problem and have no resolutions.I have already written a review here but the only thing that they are able to say is to connect through social media for a solution which is quite ridiculous as I don't have them.I called customer support because I have a problem with the internet on my phone the advisor was completely unhelpful, rude, and did not provide any help she said that the manager would have called me in 1h but as I knew nobody called.I called again and the advisor said she would transfer me to a supervisor but as always even this person was unbothered to give a solution and said they said that the issue I have with my internet is not their problem.Absolutely unacceptable service!

"Vodafone sold me a 73Mb, min 37Mb fibre package. After installed, it didn't work for two weeks, had multiple disconnections, data drops, and very high latency. An actual download rate capped at 10Mb/s. Multiple tickets, never resolved, just repetitive diagnostics by support, basically consisting or router and ONT resets. not calling at requested times. I am a ex Broadband support officer, and network infrastructure support officer, i can measure my throughput accurately and have the graphs to prove it. Support never listens, and just read from scripts, even their second line ""experts"" are not technical in any way. Vodafone are mis-selling their broadband packages by vastly over estimating the speed people can get, and relying on the public not being able to test properly, or having the technical knowledge to prove things, or giving up when reporting a fault because they are just asked to reboot things over, and over, and over again. Note, I am disabled and have problems getting down on the floor. They have repeatedly asked me to get someone round to help me, and basically inferred if i don't they will close the fault. I managed to get one rep to read back one of my call logs and it stated I refused to do diagnostics because i couldn't get to the router.",0

"I’m sorry to say that in recent months we have found Vodafone in Hayward’s Heath absolutely diabolical in being helpful with situations that do not include signing a contract and buying a new phone.For example, my phone stopped working, we went into the store and we were told to send the phone off for assessment and repair as it was still under warranty. This was done and then two weeks later - without a phone, I received a letter that was sent back to say this was not done due to it being not under warranty. This was checked in store. I was without my phone for a month due to issues and mis communication and it is still not resolved. I had to buy a new phone with a new provider. It was blamed on them being a franchise and its Vodafone fault. That doesn’t help the customer and it’s just passing the buck. Personally, once the contract is up, I will not be going with Vodafone again. Apparently they can’t close accounts in store due to it being a franchise!",0

"Left us 7 days without broadband, and provided around 200mbs of speed while we are paying for 900mbs !!!The customer service we engaged with after installation kept lying to us about what will happen and that someone is working on the issue, instead it became apparent that they were simply hoping it will resolve itself.We first waited the 24 hours for internet to switch on. nothing. then 1st call they told us actually its 48 hours. nothing. 2nd call ok they tried something to fix it we need to wait another 24hours. nothing. then 3rd call same just give it couple hours. I persisted kept asking for update. nothing day 5 I started recording their conversations and said I would publish this to show people how rubbish they are. I even called the cityfibre who installed it. first got some headway with them they told me the status of the line, that its not them because the connection to the home is valid, but the Vodafone have not ACTIVATED it. its the router basically. Vodafone denied it. when threatened with recording and more they still persisted I have to wait and wait and wait. keep resetting router each time. nothing new. finally after a week of waiting the internet finally came on.We were some tired from that ordeal that we did not want to go to someone else, but now after 9 months of experience we should have. Internet is on 95% of the time, but sometimes randomly resets. looses connection despite router being on. this is annoying as I work from home and can be on a call with someone or you are watching a movie and it just cuts off have to wait 5 minutes for it to come back.Last straw was when I checked the speed just now. I was checking it few times throughout the 9 months and it was NEVER higher than 400mbs where they promised 450mbs minimum and the speed actually  should be 900mbs. today it was 180 - 220 mbs.My ping in games is 40 at best, usually 60. that is appalling level of broadband. I had better ping when had 15 mbs broadband 15 years ago.I am connecting to the router directly with fibre internet cable to my PC. so the measurement is as close to the broadband speed as can be.",0

Swapping the sim card out, even replacing the phone, would not fix the issue.  When I would point out the various dead zones where the signal was poor at best, non-existent most of the time, they would refuse to say there was an issue (In spite of their own maps showing the area in question having poor/limited connections)Only had them call me on a few rare occasions, first was when my original contract was up, to inform me of changes to my pricing due to not being on a fixed contract.  Only found out a month later when looking at other providers, that they had decided to stick me onto a new fixed contract without any confirmation, and calls to get this fixed were met with a 'not our problem' attitude, meaning I was forced to stay with them, or be forced to pay a max of £400 to end the contract early.Next time they would call was when that contract was coming to an end.  Made sure to inform them that I didnt want to renew the contract and would be going to another provider, which was then met with a condescending, brattish attitude from the sales rep who tried to rely on scare tactics by warning about all the things I'd loose access to.The final set of times was after I have moved to a new provider.  Despite already being a few weeks into a contract with a new mobile service, they have repeatedly tried to offer me upgrades to my old contract, or incentives to rejoin.  Doesnt matter how much I say no, or say exactly why I dont want to rejoin, they refuse to take no for an answer, and kept trying to call back until I was forced to block their number.Absolutely worthless service that hides behind the lie of being the nations 'number 1 provider' while offering a poor service, terrible support, and dodgy chages to your contracts without any input from you.",0
"vodaphone poor service I've had no phone or broadband for over a week,service reception is somebody reading a script you cant understand,allways says the fault is in your house but I've had the same problem for years and its always external 3 poles up the road,WYE DONT THEY LISTEN?",0
"On Friday the 3rd January our internet became intermittent, It come on for 5 to 10 minutes and then goes off. I contacted Vodaphone 17 times to assist as my wife and I need the internet for work. I told them  on a number of occasions I  urgently needed it fixing. Like most people today we are reliant on the internet. They told me I needed to use a filter, something they claim to have provided when we opened the contract. I told them an engineer fitted it and we had nothing. We need the internet to control, our heating. I asked an engineer to call me before 10:30 on Saturday as I was going out, he called me at 12:59 when I could not answer the call, gave me a phone number to call up to 8 pm I called at 4 and it cut me off after introducing it was Vodaphone. On Saturday night I got through to an advisor after trying 4 times to contact Vodaphone using the call number and the bott. Every time I contacted them they struggled to find my account. They are now sending me a filter that will take up to 3 business days to get to me. The Advisor is calling me between 12 and 2 although I have told him I had to leave at 12 for a 120 mile journey, but i am supposed to delay this for me to tell him we still have no internet. But what will happen if the filter does not work? On Monday we are supposed to our bosses we cannot work at home until Vodaphone can be bothered to fix the issue. There has been  no offer to help us out with a free upgrade or compensation for no internet for so far three days and there is no urgency to fix the issue. Why do we need a filter after using the service for over two years. This is an extremely poor service especially for me and my wife who are dependant on the internet",0
Crap connection. Constantly drops off. The router is rubbish and the customer service is the worst in history. Stay away.,0
"Vodafone's broadband is inhumanly emphasised terms. You have to tell them 30 days before your termination needs and you will lose the £150 upfront fee if you don't return it within 14 days of purchasing their broadband, it's simply robbery. If you buy this broadband on the 1st of January and tell them on the 14th that you want to cancel, they will stop on the 14th of February and charge you 150 pounds of upfront cost and the cost from the 1st of January to the 14th of February. As a Vodafone customer for six years, unbelievable money-grabbing behaviour! Will not be buying anything from Vodafone in the future and will be telling everyone around me not to go for anything from Vodafone.On January 4th, 2025, I recently received a response from Vodafone, and I was taken aback by their statement about their ability to refund the upfront cost. On the 3rd of January, I enquired with Vodafone's online customer service, and your billing team firmly informed me that they could not refund the 150 pounds. Now, they are claiming that they can. Are you misleading your customers? I received your parcel on December 20, and I cancelled it on January 3. You have charged me over 200 pounds for the 14 days of borrowing time. I enquired with your customer service about the possibility of receiving a refund for the upfront costs if I returned the broadband to your branch on the 4th of January. However, your representative informed me they would not refund a single cent. Is the way you intend to profit from the customers?  I will go to the Vodafone branch to return the broadband in person and keep updating the details of the chargebacks.",0
"On 2 December 2024, I started a customer service call via Vodafone chat system. My current broadband commitment with them was ending. I shared the offers I received from other service providers with their evidence and told them that I wanted to continue with them if they could give the same offer. However, they asked about the phone tariffs used by me and my wife. I said that I was not interested in the telephone line and that I only wanted to get information about broadband. They said that they could not make the same offer.In that case, I asked them to take the necessary action, that I did not want to continue when my contract expired. In the meantime, when the process started to drag on, I told them that I was quite ill and asked them to speed up the process. However, the opposite happened.They told me that I had to submit a service termination request 30 days in advance, that there was an extra period in this case, and that a final invoice would be issued at a non-discounted price at the end of my commitment, which was quite high. They did not back down in any way.Then I realised in the e-mail I received that they had calculated the notice period as 32 days, not 30 days. I informed them about this, and they said that they included days such as bank holidays etc. I objected and they said they would correct it. I said OK.This whole process took 4 hours!I asked them to create file a complaint for this extremely bad customer service experience. They did, but no one ever got back to me.If it takes 4 hours to terminate an internet service even though I state that I am ill, I cannot see any other purpose here other than trying to make the customer regret the out of the service.I will take the matter to the official authorities.Non-FCA Frontline Complaint - 124527284Account number: 7074678879Chat Reference Number: 763192246090689716DATE/TIME: 2024-12-02 15:51:25 - 20:02:50",0

Staff on duty in Macclesfield on Saturday were rude and unhelpful - I went in to pick up a device that I had ordered in person in the shop two days earlier and because i did not take in id in the form of a credit charge i was not allowed to take the item - my daughter went in later to collect it and when she asked about the sim card and some technical advice was told to contact customer service,0
"Needed new phone.Called store in Touchwood Solihull.Confirmed handset was in stock.Attended store same day.Handset not in stock.Charged £6.99 for delivery as alternative.Store staff not prepared to waive delivery fee under circumstances (!)Store staff assured me they would handle transition of tel number from old provider to Vodafone.Phone was delivered. Sim card missing.Contacted Vodafone multiple times [on hold for excessive periods] trying to arrange sim card.Was told I could get an e-sim by one operator, but told otherwise by another. Was told Sim was in the post.Was advised there had also been a glitch and that the transfer of my number to Vodafone was held up and delayed [a ""porting order"" delay].In this time, my former provider issued me with emails notifying I was being cut off at my request on the same day.Called former provider and they informed me that Vodafone had instructed the cut off.Meanwhile, still no Sim.So - unable to take or make calls for around 48 hrs over festive period.Using wife's phone to contact Vodafone, I insisted that I needed a Sim. They said it was in the post.They assured me a call back same day from supervisor. This did not happen.Had to instruct wife not to leave house [or to leave phone behind] so that I could use her phone to receive / make calls [including to and from Vodafone].Sim arrived. Did not work.Also materialised that phone pin was missing from box.On phone with Vodafone, they walked me through how to set up / activate sim - and despite them being on the phone as I did this, it did not work. That call alone was 50 mins.Vodafone representatives admitted that they had attempted to call me, on the number they'd asked my former provider to cut off.No meaningful empathy from the staff or business in terms of resolution.",0
"It’s the first time i became a customer with Vodafone this is the diabolical service I received from Vodafone.I bought a phone from Vodafone 34 days ago a refurbished prestige condition phoneWhen I Asked what’s wrong with the phone before agreeing to deal with it they said the customers who decide they don’t like the colour etc they send the phone back this is what they mean by prestine they assured me nothing wrongs with the phone.The phone is not charging it takes hours to charge.The screen suddenly goes blank and if someone rings me it’s still ringing, however can’t see who rings not showing up on screen because screen is blank.Screen goes blank.I phoned them they are not willing to do anything about the phone or exchange it for another, the only thing they are doing is taking it in for repair I don’t even know if it will work when they send it me back.Can you believe this happened with an I phone 14 pro max within 34 days.I’ve lost all trust.I also asked would I still have to pay a months bill as I’ve had no use of the phone they said I will have to pay it, not willing to budge making me feel like I’m the victim.They are making out like it’s my fault it seems like the customer is in fault after 34 days of no phone usage, faulty phoneI’m going crazy, I feel like crying, they have given me severe anxiety 😥I thought Vodafone is a well established company clearly not if they re crying over a phone which is a fault from their end not the customers.",0
"twice no one has turned up to connect me. That is two days work lost. No one bothered to call to say they were not coming. I will try once more and then I think I will cancel the contract as I simply cannot afford to keep taking time off work,",0
"My experience with Vodafone has been extremely disappointing. Their mishandling of my case involving fraudulent device loan agreements shows a complete failure in safeguarding customer accounts and addressing issues fairly.1. Lack of Proper Security MeasuresVodafone allowed someone to create two loan agreements in my name without my consent. Changes to my email and address were made without any proper identity verification. When I flagged this, I was told that since these agreements were made online, no authorisation or signature was required. This is a glaring oversight in their processes and a failure to protect their customers.2. Inappropriate AdviceAfter reporting the issue, I informed Vodafone that the police explicitly advised me not to contact the individual responsible. Despite this, Vodafone repeatedly encouraged me to reach out to the person, leaving me in an even worse position than before. This was completely inappropriate and showed a lack of understanding about the risks involved.3. Unresolved Security VulnerabilitiesI raised concerns that the answers to the security questions on my account are not mine, yet Vodafone has failed to address this. This means my account remains vulnerable to further misuse, which is deeply concerning.4. Refusal to Take ResponsibilityRather than taking accountability for their failure to secure my account, Vodafone has shifted the burden onto me. Despite blacklisting the devices, they are still charging me for the loans and have advised me to take the matter to small claims court. This shows a lack of willingness to resolve the issue and disregard for their role in allowing this to happen.What Vodafone Should Have Done:Cancelled the fraudulent loan agreements immediately.Investigated and fixed the security vulnerabilities that allowed this to happen.Taken responsibility for their failure to verify the identity of the person creating the agreements.Final Thoughts:Vodafone’s handling of this situation has been unacceptable. Their failure to protect my account, their inadequate security processes, and their reluctance to take responsibility have caused unnecessary stress and financial burden.If you’re considering Vodafone, DON'T!—their lack of accountability and poor handling of security issues could leave you in a similar position.",0
I am with vodafone for long time.I wanna an upgrade to my phone contact to ipone pro max 16.So i called the customer service and tried to get deal. So we amost done with the deal.But before i sign the contract i find out they add something which they didn’t discuss with me. So it’s basically the put me phone deal for 36 months £35 months which cost me £1260 and sim deal for 24 months with £10.I am paying basically £45 for monthly..The worst part is they didn’t tell me phone contacts for 36 months..even they include my old phone trade in but still i have to pay £1260 for phone where same phone i can get from apple store for £1199. £1260 including my old phone trade in cost £170 if i buy with apple they trading with my old phone for £90 and cost is down £1109. Huge difference. My only concern is they never mentioned about 36 months contract. It is misleading and waste of time for me as i have to with them almost an hour.And finally I cancelled my contract..Its not acceptable at all.Thanks,0
"Absolutely rubbish, moved home ,supposed to supply Internet from 31st December, still waiting  spoken to 4 advisers,all rubbish can't even send an engineer to fix problem, but expect payment",0
"I'm currently with EE (just mobile and mobile internet) and because of the Wi-FI going down, now and again, I wanted to switch to broadband and just get a cheap pay monthly sim, to use home broadband off if I need it.I decided to start up with Vodafone. I ordered their broadband but wanted to upgrade, to a better service. They told me I had to cancel and start again. I hadn't been connected yet. So I cancelled and signed up for the new deal, they told me was available. Upon getting to the last page they said I couldn't get it, because it was full fibre and I was in a part fibre area. So, I had to cancel that and then apply again for the previous deal. The router arrived on the 28th December, for the cancelled 6th January install date. Then I got notified by DPD that I was getting another package on the 4th (today), which was for the new 9th January installation (the reapplied contract after the two previous cancellations). I received emails, from Vodafone, telling me that installation date was on the 6th and another on the 9th. I didn't know what was going on. I went to chat and waited ages for them to answer, because they were all too busy on other chats, in between my chat. They then told me I had come through to the wrong chat, even though they'd connected me to broadband. I was talking to Pay as You Go monthly. So I called them and got an exceptionally rude Indian man, no doubt in India, who couldn't give a rat's arse about my problem. To top it off, before I was connected to him, I had to press umpteen buttons to speak to him, being told my connection date was the 6th of January. He told me I had to installation date set up, before I hung up on him for his rudeness. In the middle of another call, waiting to be answered, DPD arrived and I just gave him both packages to be sent back to Vodafone. I told the assistant to cancel everything, at which he then told me that I had no installation date booked.What a waste of time. They didn't have a clue what was going on. I'm so glad I never entered into the 24 month contract. All that hassle and I wasn't even a customer yet. LOL",0
Customer service shoddy. Chief executive department is near useless. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Vodafone as a company is absolutely rubbish.I went with Vodafone as their broadband cost was cheaper than my existing supplier, Sky. I cancelled with Sky and joined up with Vodafone. The installation was booked on 27/12/24. The technician came and installed it, but there was no internet. The technician advised it needs activating at the pole, which will take 24 hrs. I get a call the following day (28/12/24) about how my internet is. I advise waiting for it to be activated. They checked their system and found that there is something wrong with the lighting at the pole that is connected to the internet, and it will be reviewed on 7/1/24. Bearing in mind that I work from home. The family is reliant on the internet,  I took a day off on 27/12/24 to get it installed; now they're saying it will be reviewed on 7/12/24, so I will be left without internet. I had to cancel with Vodafone on 28/12/24 and called Sky back up to put me back on, but they said as I cancelled with them, the line is with Vodafone. So unable to provide internet until they receive notification from Vodafone, which will take 24 hrs. Also, Sky has bumped up their price, which is costing more money going back to them. Furthermore, the agents at Vodafone don't know what tariff I am on; I signed up for £21 a month with a discount. After calling them up with all these issues, they were adamant I was on £28 a month. At the end I spoke to a UK agent who confirmed I am on a £21-a-month contract.Vodafone prices may be cheap, but if you're working from home or you need an internet connection to go smoothly, do not rely on them. They have caused stress, inconvenience, and I am worse off financially, or thanks to Vodafone. They are the worse company ever. I would not recommend them.",0
"I had a highly unsatisfactory experience with Vodafone's broadband service and cannot recommend it. During my one-year contract, the connection dropped at least ten times each evening. Upon completing the contract, I sought to cancel the service. However, when I contacted Vodafone via chat, I was informed that a 30-day notice was required, which I later discovered was incorrect for customers outside of the contract period.Subsequently, Vodafone proposed upgrading my connection to fiber optic, assuring improved stability and speed. I scheduled an engineer appointment, but the engineer failed to arrive on two occasions, causing me to waste two days waiting. Frustrated, I contacted Vodafone again to cancel all services and received confirmation that my account was closed. I also received an email offering compensation of £219 for the failed connection attempts, which I disregarded, believing my association with Vodafone had ended.Ten months later, I received emails indicating overdue payments of £28, followed by another stating a balance of £63. Upon contacting Vodafone via chat, I was advised to visit a store, where I was then directed to call customer service. It became evident that Vodafone had not canceled my account as confirmed; they had been charging me for ten months, depleting my credit, and only notified me when the credit was exhausted.Additionally, during a 40-minute call with customer service, the agent terminated the call, citing that I had been waiting too long.(I know the info from the customer service team when I went in the shop they looked into my account and I have read all their notes, disgusting)I strongly advise avoiding Vodafone and recommend verifying that any account cancellations are fully processed to prevent similar issues.",0
"I ordered a new home broadband service from Vodafone this week and spent an hour providing all the necessary information to a customer service agent. I signed up for a 24 month contract and was very happy with the package. My current provider BT then notified me that Vodafone were preparing to take over the service in a few weeks, so all seemed to be progressing well and I was impressed with Vodafone. However, the following day I got an unexpected email from Vodafone saying my order was cancelled and that I would need to ring them in 4 days time to raise a new order again. I initially thought it was a scam. I contacted Vodafone to find out what was happening and to try and reinstate the order. After using their chat service I was passed through 5 different teams for over an hour trying to get clarity on what had happened. They confirmed the order was cancelled but could not help me or explain why. They told me I had cancelled it but I hadn’t. When I told them it was clearly a mistake and that I still wanted to go ahead and requested that they simply reinstate my order, they told me I couldn’t and that I would have to start all over again. Obviously I don’t want to do this - partly as I don’t have the time and also for fear of having the next order cancelled as well. So, after many hours trying to transfer my broadband service to Vodafone I actually don’t have anything to show for it other than a cancelled contract and a notification from BT that they are going to end my current service in a few weeks time. I can’t tell you how stressful this experience has been and how frustrating it has been to try your very best to become a customer of Vodafone. Their customer service teams really don’t seem to have the information or systems needed to support them. My final request to Vodafone was for someone to call me to help me reinstate the order. Amazingly they told me they couldn’t call me. I’m now looking at alternative providers in the hope they can do better.",0
Very expensive plus couldn’t provide full fibre. Gone elsewhere for half the price and 6 times faster speed.,0
"One of the Worst Broadband ServicesI had one of the worst experiences with Vodafone while purchasing their broadband service. Initially, they offered a huge discount in the form of gift cards, which seemed appealing, but I later realized the issues hidden behind their service.After installation, I found that the WiFi range was insufficient for my home. I contacted Vodafone customer service, requesting a solution either to fix the issue or send me a WiFi booster (one or two, depending on the need). Instead of resolving the problem, they insisted I upgrade my contract to a more expensive plan to get a booster. All I asked for was a WiFi extender, not free broadband for life!The situation worsened when a customer advisor promised to call me back on December 26, 2024, to arrange a return. Not only did she fail to keep her promise, but she was also extremely unprofessional during the call. I could hear a house party in the background, with kids crying and noise throughout. If you can’t fulfill a promise, don’t mislead customers it adds unnecessary stress. Why couldn’t Vodafone use the voucher credit they offered as part of the promotion to send a WiFi extender or their so-called booster? It’s frustrating that they push customers to upgrade their contracts instead of using the existing credit to address basic service issues. This would have been a fair and logical solution, considering I only needed a simple device to fix the poor WiFi range not a costly new plan.”My biggest concern was the cooling-off period. If I didn’t return the equipment on time, I would have been stuck in their contract. Thankfully, I contacted Vodafone again around 5:30 PM (UK time) and spoke to a representative named Bumba. He was professional, helpful, and explained everything clearly. I truly appreciated his assistance and told him I’d leave a review to highlight the issues and commend his support.Now, Vodafone has sent me an email stating that I need to pay for a full month’s service, even though I only used it for six days and canceled well within the cooling-off period. According to the Consumer Rights Act, this charge seems completely unjustified.",0
"Moved house and moved the vodaphone broadband over to my new house, they changed my contract without my permission and after hours of phone calls for them to admit fault and put my contract back to original contract, constant lying, had enough and leaving them finally , paid up to the end of the month and now suddenly they are switching my internet off and on even though there’s 20 days before I leave ,stay well clear , go with sky or utility warehouse",0
I went into the store and was standing there for a good 10 mins whilst the sales assistant watched me obviously aware that I needed help eventually he asked me what I needed help with I said I'm interested in this pay as you go phone he said we don't have any of the pay as you go phones without even checking to see why put about 20 pay as you go phones on display if your out of stock and don't have them  it's a waste of time for the customer it's not rocket science to remove them from display if there not in stock available for sale.,0
Try to upgrade on black friday as I'm due a upgrade never received my phone so I done a chat vie my app was told it was cancelled and there's a glitch on my account they will sort it so come December I tryed again and again it was cancelled then I thought 3rd time lucky and new year but once again cancelled i was told it was a glitch then told it was the sim then told I could reorder but again nothing then I was told that I now can't doing anything untill March well I can't wait as I'm taking all 3 accounts I have some where eles as it's been lies after lies,0
"The main complaint I have with Vodafone UK is their poor service, specifically regarding buffering and latency issues. After months of frustration, I bought a third-party router (TP-Link Deco) which finally resolved the issues, proving that the fault was with the router provided by Vodafone. Despite this, Vodafone refused to send a replacement router or send someone to test the equipment. Their boosters and routers are of very poor quality, and I strongly recommend avoiding them. Instead, invest in a reliable router like TP-Link Deco or Eero and use the PPPoE account provided by Vodafone rather than their subpar devices.From the outset, Vodafone’s service has been appalling. When I first signed up, they never bothered to send anyone to properly set up the connection. Aside from the Openreach engineer installing the fibre, I had to do everything else myself. Despite reporting multiple issues, Vodafone repeatedly came up with different excuses for the poor service. At various times, they blamed congestion, my house, the number of devices I was using, or even the fact that I tested the internet on iPhones rather than Android devices. I was told to make video calls to show the cable I was using—even though I was using a high-quality Cat 8 cable.Despite all of this, no one from Vodafone ever came to my address to properly investigate the issue. Instead, I was left dealing with a support team that appeared to lack any knowledge of broadband or technical troubleshooting. I’ve had to waste hours on the phone, often during the day when I’m at work, and was still left with no resolution.Even after I reported the case to CISAS, Vodafone continued to be inconsistent. They emailed me stating I would not have to pay a termination fee, yet every time I tried to cancel, they insisted I would be charged £70 for the remaining three months. This lack of accountability is unacceptable.To make matters worse, when I asked for email responses instead of phone calls, their standard reply was to offer another 24-month contract, with no credit or reimbursement for the time I paid for non-functional devices.For anyone considering Vodafone broadband, I strongly advise against it. If you’re looking for a reliable provider, check out Zen, Cuckoo, or Utility Warehouse, and focus on Openreach providers with better reviews. Avoid Vodafone’s devices entirely—use your own router with a PPPoE account, which is easy to set up and far more reliable.Additional Advice: If you’re considering Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, make sure you have the latest devices in your home (e.g., iPhone 16, the latest MacBook, or top-tier Lenovo laptops) to fully utilise these technologies. Otherwise, they’re not worth it.To Vodafone: Please do not respond with a generic “contact us to discuss” reply. Every time I’ve contacted you, I’ve been stonewalled, ignored, or offered unhelpful solutions. Your customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced.Update 13.01.25: Vodafone reached an agreement, and I received a credit as compensation. A new contract has been established without any additional boosters, offering a favourable monthly rate.",0
"In essence, they incorrectly charged me, took my money and then said they couldn't do anything to put it right. However, let me take you on a journey of poor customer service:I was billed mid-December for a broadband service that was not even due to be connected until 7 January. I contacted their customer service rep who told me it was a technical error, it would be resolved without me doing any more and they definitely would not take my money.They took my money.I logged on to my account and tried to connect to customer service. It needed to verify who I was (despite me having logged in) and offered to send a verification code. It then refused to send a verification code as I didn't have a Vodfone mobile. Instead I had to enter my account id and password again.I was then through to the AI chatbot - artificial certainly, intelligent not at all. It refused to accept this was a problem it could not resolve and we ended up going round in circles with the dunce bot sending me a copy of the bill several times and insisting it could explain it. In the end, I explicitly asked to be connected with a real person. This is did after a few more inane questions to get me to the ""right"" person.I explained the problem to the real person. Who asked me to confirm that I had no broadband from them. A point they should have known and eventually went on to accept.This took an enormous length of time as the real person replied very slowly (presumably juggling to many enquiries at once). Speed of response was so slow that the dunce bot kept interjecting with threats to terminate the conversation, even though it was the rep that was failing to respond.The rep tried to excuse the charge on the basis that I was paying for a landline connection. For a host of different reasons, this was nonsense. So they lied about not taking the money and then lied about the reason for the charge.Finally, it was acknowledged the bill had been issued in error. I thought light could be seen at the end of the tunnel. However, even though the bill should not have been issued and the money should not have been taken, the rep said they could do nothing about it. They had no power to issue a credit note against the bill or to return my money! This from the person the dunce bot had connected me to because of an ability to resolve billing issues.After fruitless and slow further discussion which just served to make me angry, I asked to be connected to a supervisor/manager. The rep said there was no point as the supervisor had the same powers an would just say the same thing!I asked if there was a formal complaints procedure/contact. This question was not answered.I decided to abandon the call and see, for the first time in my life, whether the direct debit guarantee scheme would offer an avenue to get my money back.I was offered an email with a transcript of the call. I thought this might be useful so accepted. It asked for my email yet again. Unsurprisingly the the transcript was never sent (yes, I checked junk.)In the unlikely event anyone reads this far, sorry for the long review; just needed to get it off my chest.UPDATE: Found their formal complaints procedure. It was impressively efficient and sorted everything out very quickly. It is a shame it had to come to that.",0

"Customer service has to be the worst I've ever experienced, installation of our new customer broadband was only half completed as cherry picker was needed to connect line from house to pole as the pole is labelled unsafe to climb, I've been in touch with them on numerous occasions via Facebook messenger with a different customer service person every time, since the install date of 6/12/24 and still have not been given a date as to when it's going to be completed, all I get is review dates that come and go without anything new to report or any action taken to get a date to complete from Openreach, have raised an official complaint with them too which they automatically closed without any solution given apart from £10 good will gesture into my account that I can't yet access??, appalling way to treat a new customer, I'm going to give it a few more weeks and if not installed I'm going to cancel as they have failed to honour their side of the contract !!Vodafone, have tried the link in your reply previously and the bot Tobi is absolutely useless !!Any people who are thinking about joining Vodafone just read the reviews and make your own minds up....",0
"I visited your Harrow store on December 11, 2024, to port my number from another network and take advantage of an online offer that I found. I was assisted by Store Manager Hafsa, and the situation has since been plagued by mistakes, delays, and poor communication.Chronology of Events:1. Initial Porting Error & Promise of £75 Offer:On December 11, 2024, I went to the Harrow Vodafone store to port my number and purchase a broadband package. While attempting the porting process, Store Manager Hafsa made an error with the phone numbers. She assured me that the issue would be resolved within 24-48 hours and also confirmed that I would receive a £75 offer on my account.2. Service Disruption:Despite this promise, after 3 days, the issue persisted. I contacted Hafsa again, and she informed me that it would take another 48 hours to resolve. During this time, my temporary Vodafone SIM stopped working as of December 12, and I was left without service. I continued using my old SIM for two more days, but it, too, was deactivated, leaving me without network or internet access for over 48 hours.3. Further Delays & Inadequate Solutions:I returned to the Vodafone store, where I was provided with another temporary SIM, with added minutes and 15GB of data and its finished within some days and I recharged my self .However, the problem remained unresolved, and I was repeatedly told by customer service to wait another 48 hours for activation.4. Unclear Communication & Rude Behavior:I requested a callback from a manager, and a representative claimed to be a manager, promising a resolution in another 24-48 hours. Unfortunately, nothing happened. I called customer service again, and this time, I was transferred to the technical department, where I was subjected to rude behavior and a repetitive response to “wait another 48 hours.”5. Transfer Confirmation from Previous Provider & PAC Code Issues:After speaking with my previous network provider, I was informed that the porting process had already been completed. I then requested either my Vodafone SIM to be activated or for a PAC code to be issued. However, Vodafone customer care informed me that they were unable to issue a PAC code due to unspecified reasons.6. Incorrect Information Regarding £75 Offer:On December 24, 2024, I spoke with Hafsa again, and during this call, she informed me that the £75 offer I was promised was not applicable to me and was only for existing customers. This contradicts the email confirmation I received on December 11, which clearly outlined the offer. I find this inconsistency and lack of accountability deeply frustrating.Current Status:As of December 26, 2024, my original phone number (which I have been using for the past four years) is still not activated, and I am unable to use my Vodafone account or services. This ongoing issue has caused severe disruption to my personal and professional life, including affecting my work, communication with family and friends, and overall connectivity.Resolution ASAP ,I will escalate the issue to Ofcom and other relevant authorities.",0
My pac has not yet come and my mobile data,0
"They offered broadband and landline. The broadband is fine but the landline doesn’t work. After a number of iterations the latest is for the matter to be referred to another department. I’ve received a text to say the broadband is fine, which it always was. There was no mention of the landline which still doesn’t work. My 92 year old father in law relies on the landline to call us if he has a problem so this is a really serious matter.",0
I put in £40 for unlimited data package but the can't supply it now they have my money and I am going too be taking them to small claims court to get my money back they are worst phone company I have ever seen I was told to give it 24hrs for the plan to take the money and still nothing,0
"Vodaphone 500 mb deal. Day 1 203mbps, 5th day 37.2! OK 'settling in period' but two concurrent days, below 40 no way! I then wasted an hour of my life with their hapless Tobi Chatbox rubbish talking to the Pacific ring.Almost beaten by their complete inertia, as a last shot, I rung Cusomer Service after a treasure hunt online to access the number!Another waste of time, I could hardly understand what the woman was saying, little remedy that the content had to my situation. Definitely from a script, she was completely absorbed about identity etc.Told them I would quit within the 14 day cooling period from service if the speed didn't improve. After the best part of two hours of this friction my download shot back up to 200+. A short lived fix though, for this morning and all day 29 .4! Got onto my old provider TalkTalk, who took over the whole thing very competently and I go live 2/1/25 with them with an Amazon 6e mesh router. What an utter waste of advertising and all thats involved with gaining a customer in a very competitive and active market. Shocking performance, I'd have fired the lot if they'd ever worked for me! Instead this experience will be hidden, buried in a bland world of Corporate anarchy and disinterest.OK £8 a month more with TT and only 150mbps top download, but at 80 years of age my heart doesn't want any more trips down Vodaphone's 'Stroke Road' to nowhere. Service and competence has a value and living for two years dreading having to contact the supplier has a price and one I'm pleased to pay!",0
Great service at carphone warehouse but the problems started once setting up.Terrible reception which I thought was guaranteed but Im now advised that as the issue is with the construction of my house I’m stuck paying for a phone that I can’t use in my own home.I will refer to Ofgem but for now I’m having to go back to EE so beware of these false promises relating to network coverage .I was also given an incorrect telephone number ( by text) to ring to remove my voicemail.I tried ringing unsuccessfully from various locations ( as it doesn’t work at home ) only to find out it was a typo so another waste of hours of my life I won’t get back!UPDATEThank you for your response .I did both of your suggestions!1210 does not work as I constantly get a call failed as I can’t phone from home.I cannot completely turn off the voicemail and am told it could take 6 months to delete messages on there already.( I’ve been back to Carphone Warehouse and they cannot do it either) .I did use your tool to check coverage and it says excellent coverage indoors and outdoors so your information is inaccurate and a  waste of time just like your network !,0
"Customer Care is shocking, awful experience with them after cancelling broadband,  they try to send you more bills, unnecessary hassle off them, charge you £5 when you've cancelled direct debit but when they go on to make mistakes all you get is the famous sorry.0 out of 10Useless company",0
Absolutely disgusting. Got an iPhone 5 which I changed my mind on. I returned it and now 4 months later they have sent my details to a debt collecting company saying I owe £40 for that phone . I’ve rang them so many times and each time they say I owe nothing. Why can’t they just sort this out. It’s the worse phone company ever. Would not recommend.,0
"I recently went on a trip to Saudi Arabia found out I had wracked up roaming charge. I have four accounts with Vodafone, when I disputed these roaming charges as I have a spend cap of 0 on all my 4 accounts, I came across the rudest two people in the form of Abhisheikh and Kratika from web chat who flat out refused to raise an official complaint for me. I will be taking all my 4 accounts from Vodafone as soon as possible. Stay clear from Vodafone they are crooks. They kept me waiting for an hour on Xmas eve wasted my time",0
"Vodaphone offered us an upgrade on our broadband on 18/12/2024. We were told this would be done on 19/12/2024, we were not informed that any issues would occur. We have not had internet since! After many phone calls and getting told different issues we still have no connection. We have now been told to wait another 48 hours even after being told this would guaranteed be sorted by yesterday and to not worry. So that’s Christmas with no broadband which means the presents we have got the children will not be able to be used, we will not be able to have music or watch any TV as this is all done through our broadband.I have been a loyal customer for years and I’m utterly disgusted that this is not being sorted and no one at vodaphone seems to care about this. Would not recommending vodaphone to anyone going forward.",0
"Don't get this WiFi if you're living in a rental property, the company has no sympathy for things that are completely out of your control.Our landlord sold our flat near Christmas, so we had to leave our flat and obviously cancel the WiFi due to this.I contacted Vodafone and was met by Rohit, he was good at cancelling the broadband but had absolutely 0 sympathy for my situation and just wanted to charge me a cancellation fee of £144.41 plus give a month's notice for internet I can't even use as I don't live at the flat.Company just wants money, don't care about anything else.. will never be using Vodafone again.",0
AVOID! I’ve had broadband for 6 months and I’ve spent over 13 hours on the phone to them as the internet drops out several times every single day!!I’ve contacted them 13 times since October. Every time they run through the same process and nothing has changed. They always say they will call back but they never do!!I tried to make a complaint on the phone and when I’ve called back today apparently the complaint wasn’t even submitted their end.They’ve tried to say I need to pay more even though I’m on one of the top packages!  They’ve refused to refund days I’ve not even had internet. They won’t close my contract without me paying!!I think I have been very patient trying to resolve this during the 13 hours spent on the phone to them. Now I’m trapped paying for broadband that doesn’t even work!!,0

"No phone, 58 minutes on my neighbours phone and still no resolution!!!! Totally useless. Avoid them!!!! The customer service is the worst I’ve ever had to deal with!!!",0
Only one word to describe Vodafone. Awful awful awful.  Customer service is non existent - go elsewhere - I have never come across such rude vile unprofessional call handlers and the amount of mistakes made on my account is shocking.  GO ELSEWHERE,0

"My Experience with VodafoneI want to share my experience with Vodafone, a company that has caused me significant frustration, financial loss, and emotional distress. What started as a simple request to switch my mobile number turned into a nightmare of fraudulent practices, poor customer service, and unauthorized charges.On 25 November 2024, I contacted Vodafone to transfer my mobile number from my previous provider, EE, to their network. I provided the necessary PAC code and was assured that my number would be successfully transferred by the evening. However, later that day, my phone lost signal entirely, and my number was not switched as promised.When I contacted Vodafone to resolve the issue, I was shocked to be told that I had another contract associated with Carphone Warehouse. This was completely untrue—I have never had any connection with Carphone Warehouse. Despite my insistence that this was a mistake, Vodafone failed to resolve the problem.Instead of fixing the issue, Vodafone created a second contract in my name without my consent. This contract was unauthorized, fraudulent, and completely unnecessary. As a result, my service was disrupted for days, leaving me without access to my mobile number, which severely impacted my personal and professional life.The situation worsened when Vodafone deducted £39.67 from my bank account, far exceeding my agreed monthly contract payment of £17. This charge was unauthorized and a clear indication that Vodafone deliberately created this second contract to extract more money from me.Despite numerous calls and complaints to Vodafone, their responses were dismissive and inadequate. They initially offered me a compensation of £10, which was later increased to £245. However, this does not even begin to cover the financial harm, inconvenience, and emotional stress their actions have caused me.This entire ordeal has been nothing short of a nightmare. Vodafone’s actions, including creating an unauthorized contract, disconnecting my service, and withdrawing funds without my consent, are fraudulent and unethical. They have shown no accountability, no genuine effort to resolve the issue, and no respect for my rights as a customer.I have decided to take legal action against Vodafone to hold them accountable for their actions. This includes filing a claim in court to demand the immediate cancellation of the unauthorized contract, a full refund of all unauthorized charges, and compensation for the harm caused. Additionally, I plan to share my story publicly so that others are aware of Vodafone’s unethical practices.This experience has shown me that Vodafone cannot be trusted as a service provider. Their actions have caused me unnecessary stress, financial loss, and wasted time. I urge others to think carefully before choosing Vodafone, as no customer should have to go through what I have endured.",0
"Poor and pathetic services in Maidenhead area. Anyone living near maidenhead, don’t even think of getting the services.No internet at all and every time you call them they will say the maintenance work is going and there is no ETA for this.Absolutely gutted.",0
Awful internet coverage. Two days this week no internet at all. Vodafones response there are many factors that affect this. But this wasn't just for a short period of time they are offering no service at all. Dealing with customer service is painful as they really aren't very helpful and don't all adopt the same practice. Had many different providers over the years and Vodafone has been the worst. If you don't want to risk pulling your hair out in frustration at an internet company can't provide the one service your paying for avoid!!! I will expect the usual standard response to a review they always provide. Please phone us do we can help. Well after hours of trying to get anywhere with Vodafone I refuse to spend anymore time dealing with them. I get notifications saying I asked to change things I haven't. Shambles of a company.,0
"Network drops out several times a week, custom care is shocking, they tell you what you want to hear just to get you off the phone or simply hang up. I've spent 6 hour on the phone over the last couple of weeks to them and still no further forward. I CANT WAIT TILL MY CONTRACT IS OVER!!!!🤬🤬",0
Shit company charged me more every month carnt out a screen shot in 4 some reason wonder why that be,0
"Absolutely horrendous network provider. Left me stranded in the wind, no network, couldn't book a taxi and no wifi closeby!!! I absolutely HATE VODAFONE.You guys disgust me.",0
Just spent 20 minutes going in circles around the Vodafone 191 automated system trying to speak to a human and it was impossible.I will be cancelling my contract tomorrow. Absolutely disgusting lack of service.,0
"Vodafone are charging me a whole month line rental for a period where I am no longer a customer.  Customer representative told me I should pay a false bill, so I can claim a refund later. Makes absolutely no sense at all. In any other sense, this is theft (demanding money for a service that you will not be providing)Also, access via the web front end hardly ever works (Safari). The chat function falls over frequently - the desire for feedback at the end of the chat also means that you cannot save the transcript. Access to information is difficult generally, for example nowhere can I find the date that I ported my number away to a new provider. The two years I was with them, the signal was also very patchy as well.Update 30/12- reduced to one star. They are now charging me a £5 late payment fee, even though I am out of contract with them!. in other words realising their mistake (charging me line rental for a period after my contract had ended) they have send me a revised final bill of £zero with a late payment fee of £5. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and really adds weight my accusation of this company being thieves (demanding money for a service that they are not providing, and then fining me a further £5 plus VAT, for not paying for a service that they are not providing). Honestly, you couldn't make this up.(and yes, I have spoken to your social media team. I have been messaging them for one hour, and so far have got as far as the basic questions).",0
This happens to a lot of users so i had cancelled my membership with them and after that cancellation they had charge me two months after until i said something . This has happend to my partner aswell and they said that they didn’t know why it kept charging him money after he cancelled the contract with feb and charged him in march and April . Before going with Vodafone just be prepared for when they charge you after you cancel your contract with them.,0
I'm still awaiting a response to my complaint and the broadband team to phone me! It's getting beyond a joke now!,0
"Signed up and was given an installation date - nearly 2 weeks later it was finally put in by a sub contractor. Only the phone upstairs works and they can’t fix it.Vodafone never answer the phone. There’s no other contact other than a useless AI bot. Customer service is WOEFUL!!!!!?UPDATE…Vodafone, I’m not on facebook or insta…just answer your phone instead…that’ll help!!!",0
"The worst network provider ever. Switched to Vodafone 4 weeks ago, the line went down on Thursday and will not fix it until Tuesday which is unacceptable as I work from home!!!!! This company is a joke! Avoid ! Been with BT and Vergin and never had issues so switching back to Virgin or BT. Don't  use it.",0
"Ordered 3 phones for Christmas to be delivered to a relative to hide. Vodafone a) got address wrong despite being given correct one, b) tried to deliver to previous address when told I had moved and had correct current address, c) delivered only 2 phones. I have spent in excess of 4 hours today trying to get this sorted. None of their staff have English as their first language so can't understand what they are being told, do not read previous contact information, tell complete lies ie. The phone was delivered, the phone was cancelled, the phone was redirected all on one call. 4 separate complaints raised and not one call back from manager as requested numerous times. Appalling customer service. Did offer to deliver on 25th December when I had to inform him that is Christmas day in our country! Extremely disappointed and unbelievably unhelpful staff.",0
Our interest has been down for two weeks now since storm Darragh. We spoke several times to a lady at customer services who assured us everything would be up and running within a week and we’d be compensated for our hardship.The engineer called today and fixed the problem but he said the router needed replacing as the signal wasn’t stable and it shouldn’t be like that. Vodafone have just messaged to congratulate themselves for fixing the problem and when we asked about compensation we’d get £9.76 for a reduced timeframe. About a week. We’re not getting a new router either. Contract runs out in March so they know where they can shove the renewal!,0
"I can’t make or receive phone calls from my house due to poor Vodafone service. Ironically, after chatting online to Vodafone they told me to call them to sort this issue which is hard when I have zero signal at home. I’m eight months pregnant and have had issues with the hospital not being able to ring me. Vodafone insists the network coverage is good at my address but I know it’s not. Case in point when I called to discuss this issue the call immediately cut out. My husband is on O2 and has signal at home.I asked about leaving Vodafone and was told I could pay out the remainder of my contract. Why should I pay anything to leave as I’m currently paying for services I’m not receiving!",0
Customer service is gone for good...I am with Vodafone since 2001 as a personal customer and also since 2015 as a business cutomer. The customer service currently is the worst that I experienced in all these years. I will move away once the contract finishes.,0
"The quality of the broadband is good, but the app provides false information about payments and bills aren't showing details about missed payment.I must been missed one payment for them and than strange things happened:Next month I tried to pay for the current bill but had no idea about missed payment (they never informed me about it) there was some super strange glitch:first payment had returned the message unsuccessful so I tried to pay again and it was successful. Than when I have checked with their app it shown double amount taken. I checked the previous month and it says that successful payment via DD. So I have contacted them via chat: first thing no4 PIN nor memorable word have been working, after unsuccessful attempts to pass so many security questions my chat has been disconnected. After putting again in the PIN and memorable word via their app I have started new chat this time I passed the security with no problems, then I started the dispute about the double payment and it was a terrible experience: the agent said that it is shown on the bill that I paid for the both missed payment and current month - it was a rude lie - no such information has been given on the bill only current month and the late fee has been shown but overall sum has been doubled. After 2 hours of me trying to explain what is wrong I have checked my account statement from the bank and indeed there was no transfer of DD to Vodafone for missed month, but also there was no reversal information which is always provided if the DD is unsuccessful. For me it is very strange that the app is showing that I paid for the broadband and also makes me suspicious that they have no provided any information that payment has been missed also very strange that it is not detailed on the bill for what they charged me double amount plus late fee and at the end the strange glitch occurred during payment.1 I was never informed about missed payment2 there is no evidence in the app (it's shows paid via DD3 even during this payment wasn't any information about missed payment and that I paying for it4 on the bill is no information about the missed payment - the final sum doesn't add upI don't know what to think about that experience it makes me starting to believe in the conspiracy theoriesAlso it's extremely hard to communicate with agent via chat the window don't scroll automatically to the latest messages by me or by agent you have to do it manually, after couple seconds of inactivity it says: ""I'll give it three more minutes before I end this chat session"" and it is very stressful to log into the bank and check the account within 3 minutes.Also it's really strange that when I have logged into my banking app it downloaded the statement from year before and it is usually showing the latest statements on the top.As well they said that theirs system does not allows them for offer any form of reimbursement for the hassles and poor quality app.Everything what I have experienced makes me believe that all reality we experiencing is in the fact matrix I mean that data can change in the split of the moment in one moment I have a statement which is shown payment made but after sending the screenshot to agent it turns out to be from the year ago.I don't want to make any accusations but it's they provide the transport of the data to your device who knows if it is not possible to change the realms at least on the digital level.",0
"Tried to call to notify change of address, but office was closed so changed online. 6 weeks later, received a bill in excess of £154 - cancellation fee. Explained the situation with moving house and my intention to arrange reconnection at new property, but told 'because I made address change on line and didn't call to order new connection' the charge stands. Only with them 1 month, was preparing to switch 3 mobile accounts from o2 to Vodafone as well, but not now. Good riddance",0
Took out fibre broadband on 4 September 24 it is much better than my last broadband but unfortunately my last broadband was not cancelled phoned Vodafone when I realised I was still paying my last broadband provider I asked why it was not cancelled they said they did not do that then so I must of dreamed this because they said I was not told this although I received many messages about dates of installation etc and feel sure I asked about cancellation of old service and told it would be cancelled for me so I now have to fill in a form although been told won’t do much good being a pensioner I feel sick that I have had to pay for 2 broadband services since 4 September trying now to cancel old broadband but unfortunately can’t seem to do this will review them next,0
"We recently switched after a long time (3+ years) due to probably the worst customer service I’ve had.We moved home and with us our Broadband, but the activation date was delayed, initially by a month (fibre needed installing by open reach). That’s fair, I rang Vodafone and asked for a temporary solution as I work from home and was spending an amount of money on data (there’s a daily compensation but that doesn’t cover it). After several calls and rounds of complaints (this seems by design) they finally agreed to a temporary solution: a WiFi dongle, who would’ve thought!? They also kindly provided with a 4GB SIM card.Nearly a month and a half later the open reach team came and did the job, my broadband could be activated.Next thing I know I was being charged for the WiFi dongle, and the 4GB sim card (which I didn’t use) a non-trivial amount of money (nearly £100 in total).Given how much hassle it was to obtain a temporary solution for such a long delay in service, and they charged me for it, I’m waving goodbye to Vodafone on all accounts.",0
I am really hating on this company. I joined using the one switch process in August. They didn't cancel my old account and I have paid for both for 4 months. I called to complain and it's a a 5 minute process before you speak to someone - I finally got through and they put the phone down on me.Terrible experience so far.,0
"""I absolutely hate Vodafone. Their customer service is a nightmare – endless waits, no resolutions, and being passed from one department to another. Their billing is a mess with hidden charges and errors they never take responsibility for. The network coverage is terrible, with constant dropped calls and slow data even in cities. Their promises about 5G are a joke. Avoid Vodafone at all costs!""",0
"So I'm in quite a shocking experience with this lot. No broadband connection a month in, multiple calls and chats with various departments asking for my inside leg measurements (well, my year of birth, PIN number, account number, name). They seem unable to fix a basic router malfunction issue which could be easily fixed by sending out a new £20 router. Weird, distressing, odd, weird. I will update.",0
"Worst phone company and broadband I've ever had. Paying for two contracts when I clearly cancelled June 2024, no refund and then mentioned I should be charged £180 cancellation fee. No offer for refund. So finally get the new sim of the upgraded contract, takes 18 days to arrive and now doesn't work, because they said it was ""lost"" in the post and will be sent a new one. Moved into our home may 2024, broadband didn't work for 6 weeks. Now I'm chained to them for another two years. Quite frankly can't wait to leave.",0
Awaiting the essential broadband team to contact me!,0
"First we started by calling Vodafone, completely useless. With the phone call, in the end all they had to say was that we apparently didn't buy the phone from them (we did) and that we should go to the shop (wow, very helful thanks.) So that was a complete waste of time.I went with my Nan today because her phone started to turn off. She got the phone around last year, for a phone battery to seemingly start to fail a year after purchase is disgusting. The individuals in the store in Wigan provided no assistance, other than checking the battery percentage. Before giving the phone to them I had re-seated the battery and checked it. We were told that nothing can be done because it was purchased via pay as you go; my 80 year old disabled nan was stuck with a phone that may be starting to fail. It's honestly disgusting, is this the treatment you think she deserves? Is this what she pays you for? Wasted money on the car park too.From this bad, time-wasting, neglectful experience I can't say I'll ever recommend Vodafone to anyone again, and this was -after- I had switched her over to Vodafone. Seems that was a mistake eh?If the battery does end up failing and I have to buy a new one for her or figure something out, I can say that I am more useful than your company that specialise in this. For shame.Heed this warning if you buy your phone on pay as you go with them. This is how they treat their paying customers.",0
"Really dissapointed with the speed, and also with the customer support. I have cancelled my contract but Vodafone does not cooperate with the new broadband supplier to do the switch.",0
"One of the reasons I've stayed with Vodafone for so long is the rewards especially the Friday ones, however since renewing my contract haven't received anything for 9 weeks.  Chatted with Vodafone several times about this and constantly get fobbed off with nonsense.  I have another contract and broadband that I will be cancelling shortly.",0
"Can NOT wait for my contract to be over. Lied about me keeping my number, 0 coverage in my area which they should have known about, stuck to pay another couple hundred quid until the contract ends or I pay extra to end it early. 0 help from customer support except messing around with settings that never help or work. Save your time and money and go through any single other network provider.",0
"Ordered a phone on the 6th of December as a Christmas present to be delivered to the store, and the email said it would be in the store in two days, Still waiting for it to be delivered, I have rung Vodafone multiple times to no avail keep getting told should be with them in within five days. I have never had a problem with an order like this before I am upset and stressed about the whole thing",0
"Recently joined Vodafone UK and opted for the 300 international minutes add on for my landline.Two things I have experienced1. Terminates calls after 30 minutes2. not able to get a balance either from my web account or app.The only way is to spend up to 25 minutes on the phone or the same time on their chat service.I've even been to the local Vodafone shop and even they cannot help.So why is it so difficult for Vodafone to provide this information as I don't want to exceed my monthly allowance and incur premium charges.My previous provider gave this information via their app in real time.------------------------------------If you require any assistance, pop us over a message via Facebook: or Instagram:Thanks, Vodafone Social Media Team----------------------------------------Typical Social Media Team response -  not everyone uses Facebook or Instagram -  so why can you not respond to the questions above so others can see the reply.

"Booked a new broadband installation with Vodafone. The sign-up process ran smoothly, and plenty of information was shared before the installation date this Monday. I still have my previous contract with another provider running for another week. I was informed that Vodafone could not cancel my other contract with the other provider, which is ok because I cancelled it myself. I ensured with Vodafone's customer service in advance that this would not cause any issues with my new connection. I was reassured that I would get a brand new, separate line installed so there would not be any problem. On Monday, when the Openreach engineer started with the installation, he decided to cut the old line and install the new line, as I should be connected to my new provider within two hours. The new line is now installed, and the new ONT box is in perfect working order. However, the Power Hub refuses to connect to the newly installed ONT box. I escalated the issue to Vodafone's customer support on Monday and was asked to be patient as it could take up to midnight for the new connection to be established. However, whilst I called, they also tried two hard resets of the Power Hub, which had no success, so all I could do was wait for the magic to happen overnight. The following day, the Power Hub was still flashing red, and no connection occurred. Customer support contacted me to double-check if everything was up and running by now. I had to deny it. They tried another hard reset and then asked me to send in several photos of my setup. I would be contacted within hours by the specialist team, and if they could not solve the issue, a technical engineer would be appointed for a home visit. Nothing happened. I gave them another call. They were still waiting for the photos to be uploaded/attached to the ticket this could take another 16 hours as these photos are usually only uploaded around 9 am every day... (WHAT?) The next day, nothing happened, although I was supposed to get a follow-up call between 1 and 3 pm. Called at 3 pm, and still no photos, if I could send them again. Did so, but this time, I insisted on staying on the call until I received confirmation that the images were attached to the ticket. This happened, and I was told the specialist team would now be in touch within 4 hours. After 2 hours, att 6 pm last night, I got a text from the specialist team that an internal team would not look into my fault and that it could take until today for an update to be provided. The customer support employee from last night promised me a call this morning, which unfortunately did not happen. Instead, I got my first bill claiming money for the service that is supposedly been running smoothly since Monday and although I had been promised that I would only be charged from when the connection is succesfully established and I would be entitled to compensation as well. So, I had to call myself at noon to challenge the bill and now learn that the internal team had now promised ""an update"" on the case on the next day. So, since Monday, I am without any internet connection at home and I can no longer believe that anyone is actually really trying hard to solve the issue, instead of having two separate working lines with two different providers, I now have zero working lines and feel utterly neglected and only promised loose, non-binding updates. Where is the service technician at my place that was promised to me on Tuesday? To avoid similar issues, at this stage, I can only recommend avoiding this company by any means.",0
Vodafone Business - internet not working properly and no landline for 3 months.I choose Vodafone to provide internet and landline for my commercial premises and from the beginning we have had on/off internet and no landline at all. This is obviously a disaster for a business owner and I now regret choosing Vodafone.We opened in early October and I have been told our issues will not be resolved end of Jan/Early February. Finger's crossed that is true. I was told it wasn't Vodafone's fault but that it is an issue with the Openreach - as if that is my problem.What Vodafone have been good at is phoning me regularly to telling me nothing different than what they told me previously - that my case is escalated as a priority. Ever phone call ends with a request to fill in a survey for them.,0
"Received my router, noticed that the cable didn’t fit. Rang and asked for an adapter, was told that the adapter would be sent before my activation date. Activation date is today and no adapter received, spoke to Vodafone and was told there was never an order raised. Have to sit and wait now for another week to wait for a bloody adapter. New customer, wish I could just cancel. Why not send an adapter in the box anyway for people who might need it.",0
"Horrible irresponsible service. I was asked be home yesterday as the renewed contract phone will be delivered. However, no phone or a call. Now I’m online for the past hour with customer service who are unable to locate any record! My account number 7065712806",0
"I went on-line on Saturday 14th December 24 to request the deal for the Apple iPhone 13 128 GB which was due to end at midnight on the 19th December. The girl I dealt with appeared very efficient and processed my order sending through my contract to my email address which I needed to sign within 72 hrs. When I went to sign the contract the following day that was when my nightmare started! My husband noticed they had put the wrong address on the contract and my sort code was also incorrect. When I made contact with the team the following day they said they could amend the incorrect details but when I requested the new contract they said they couldn't amend the contract as they would need to cancel the order and start again. I was not happy to sign a contract on-line which was incorrect and after a long time trying to explain this said they would have to cancel the contract and start again. I was advised to ring back the following day giving it time to cancel on the system. When I rang on the 17th December 2024 I initially spoke with someone who insisted I would have to accept the old contract which hadn't been cancelled to get the deal despite me explaining that it had the wrong address and sort code. This gentleman put the phone down on me. With trepidation I phoned Vodafone back again on the 17th December once I went into my local Bishops Stortford store for some moral support at 3.20pm. I spoke to a gentleman on-line a Vodafone Customer Service called Stephan who was extremely rude and talked over me and after nearly two hours we were no further on with the process with him insisting the old contract was still online. The staff in store were extremely kind and supportive to me particularly Ben and his trainee, Ali, but unfortunately they could do nothing as the contract was still open on-line. Stephan advised to ring at 8am on the 18th December and he would cancel my original order. When I rang again today at 8am I spoke to Corrie who was polite and helpful but when he re-did the order again unfortunately when he got to the end of the process, it still wouldn't go through despite saying my order had been cancelled at 02.20am on the 18th. I was advised to ring again on the 19th which was the following day, noting that this deal ended at midnight on the 19th.I took the risk of ringing again today at 5.20pm and spoke to a very pleasant, empathetic young girl called Imaan, who was based in Lancaster. She reassured me that she would do her best to solve my problem and asked relevant questions which give me hope. At two different stages she checked with someone senior that the correct process was being followed and double checked my details with me to ensure everything was correct. She apologised for the distress I had encountered over the last four days with Vodafone and was genuinely caring towards me. Imaan managed to successfully process my order for the Apple iPhone and hopefully it will be delivered tomorrow. Her service was faultless. However the last four days has been an extremely distressing and stressful experience with the online service with Vodafone with each phone call at times taking up nearly two hours of my time. I praise Ben and Ali in the Bishops Stortford store and Lovely Imaan today but as for the other staff unfortunately I rate the overall service as poor.Where do we go from here, I would expect more than a written online apology for the time and stress this has caused me. I am sure Vodafone can do their homework and work out by the details I have provided who this service user is!!!!!",0

Pack of lies by the specialist team trying to tell me that they cancelled my package and carried out a credit check because the order was submitted wrong but won't tell me what was wrong. Awaiting their final response before going to the financial ombudsman service!,0
If I could give 0 I would have.They install the broadband then forget to install the landline I lost a full week of income ( business broadband) lost near enough £5k and this scammers thieves offered me £150 as they don’t compensate for the damages caused.Avoid at all costs this scammersI have follow every instructions possible you forgot to activate the line blaming BT first then some other random stuff and took no responsibility whatsoever for the damages caused.Rather than be sorry do something fair about it !!You know how to contact me! I will update if any attempt to contact me happens ( I doubt it as the reply is very standard),0
"Worst telecom company ever avoid at all cost they don’t honour their words and they keep making false promises without fulfilling them. After I cancelled my contract with them and switched to their pay as you go to keep my options open due to their unstable internet connection they disconnected my number despite saying they would transfer me over to pay as you go. And when they got me back my number after multiple long phone calls l, I kept asking them to tell me how much I owe for my final pay monthly contract bill and every time I would speak to an adviser they would give me different amounts with one saying roughly £22, the other saying £15, and the last saying nothing is owed which he confirmed repeatedly with me. However, after few weeks I was surprised to be contacted  by a debt collector who told me that they were sent by Vodafone to collect an owed amount of £19, despite being told by Vodafone that my account was clear. Therefore, I decided to call them and ask why they lied to me and went behind my back to debt collectors and guess what I was met by a rude advisor called Andi who was shouting at me after hearing my frustration as if he is the customer which was quite shocking. Anyway, after transferring me to the bills’ team I spoke with the most boring and dis-engaged adviser who was not bothered to understand what went wrong. I ended up raising a complain and making the stupid payment hoping that they won’t call back again with another bill after confirming my account to be all clear.",0
"Took out broadband with Vodafone, during the installation our property was damaged.Put a complaint through Vodafone in the complaints department which have been as useful as a chocolate tea pot in resolving this. The complaints department have lied multiple times. We’ve been waiting over a week to speak to a manager and keep being harassed by the same rep that has lied multiple times saying a manager does not exist, there is no manager, she is the manager, she’s not the manager and then to finally agree to a call back from a manager who just didn’t speak and ended up terminating the call.Safe to say we have now switched to a different company all within the 14 day cooling off period.Vodafone are quick to take your money but when there’s an issue it’s clear they don’t have any respect for their customers to try and help them resolve it. Instead they like to play games and pass you from pillar to post wasting your 14 days in order to lock you into a contract.All of our calls from Vodafone were recorded our end and I would advise everyone to record any contact you have with them to prove any lies from their part.Will never use Vodafone or recommend them ever again.",0
"Why did I leave O2Sometimes the cheaper phone contracts are not always the best thing.Signal is in and out like a yo yo for a start.The roaming charges are ridiculous. No add on available to buy if you travel out of Europe.Come on Vodafone step in to the real world.I can not imagine being told to use a SIM card from another company from o2 , three or EEYes I know you have a global package but tell people about it.You can charge people 7.39 per day for roaming because you don’t have anything in place.I will never use Vodafone again",0
Absolutely horrendous service. I was on call with them for two hours to fix my account and no solution. They have extremely slow service and poor customer care team who do not understand the issues.,0
Save yourself time and hassle and order online for home delivery. Absolutely useless.,0
"What is going on, without sending the phone to the repair centre, how come Woolwich branch decide that the phone is not covered in warranty. The application form says “Good news your device should be covered by our warranty”.And the branch gave the reply “the phone should open to see if it is valid to repair”. If the phone is working then why even we bother to come to your place. Still there is three months to end the contract. I got it repaired for my sister paying £389 cause of urgency.Better deal with it, or stop creating and selling bullshit. And, now to hide the 1 star, you are creating fake reviews, wow! 🤮🤮🤮",0
"Would give 0 if it was an option! Appalling service all around.Had the broadband service since May, does not work. Vodafone checked and said there was a blocker at my house, they did not know why but that I would need a booster, but they could not send a booster on the £33 month plan I was on. Have been paying £33 per month since May for a service I have not had! Vodafone have now switched me onto another of their plans (same price but speed not as fast?!) and agreed to send a booster, which was supposed to come on Tuesday, said I would need to be in, so I took the day off to stay home, no one came. I contacted Vodafone and they discovered that they had arranged for the item to be delivered to an old address, despite that fact that since May I have always been at my current address, which is where the engineers came, the account is set up at current address and the email confirming about the booster being sent was at my current address, so why it was arranged to old address is anyone’s guess!Vodafone agreed to amend delivery to correct address and agreed to send today. Again had to take day off, waited in, again did not come. 1 hour and 10 minutes on the phone to Vodafone for them to say they don’t know what happened today, and they can’t arrange for it to be delivered today now so will put it in for tomorrow, I explained I can’t take another day off, and I have no confidence it will be delivered anyway. Asked to speak to a manager but they said they can’t put me through to anyone, and would arrange for someone to call me back, but can’t say what time because they said the call will come from Eqypt or India.I can’t leave Vodafone, because I am stuck in a  24 month contract, and I will have to pay for 24 months (because they have just switched my plan) upfront if I leave.Just an appalling service all around, and I am stuck in it!",0

"Extremely Disappointed with Vodafone’s Device Care Plan ServiceI am beyond frustrated with Vodafone’s Device Care Plan. My iPhone’s display had a problem, so I took it to Vodafone for repair, expecting it to be covered under my plan. However, despite multiple visits, they refused to repair my phone and kept making excuses. I ended up having to pay £389 to get it fixed at the Apple Store, when, according to my Device Care Plan, Vodafone should have handled it for free.I trusted Vodafone to honor the plan, but their lack of assistance and poor customer service has left me extremely disappointed. If you’re considering Vodafone’s Device Care Plan, be aware that it may not offer the support you expect, and you might be forced to pay out of pocket for repairs that should be covered.",0
One star is simply being generous I would rate this company -5. We wanted to change our phone line & broadband services so looked on u switch that recommend Voda phone so we went with them on the 13th December which was the given activation date. We went for the pro 2 deal S we run our business from home. The day of activation came & went & as we all know how easy it is to set up a router was surprised to see after 24hrs still no signal or connection so phoned the helpline. Unfortunately that’s where the problems started it took 5 attempts to call the helpline centre based in the Philippines due to the line cutting out but still ticking over on time which as we are not a Vodafone customer standard rates apply. After an exhausting 3 hrs of calls we were informed that the router has a fault. They would have to send out a new kit and reactivate on the 19th December so for the sake of my business I cancelled the contract which had been going for 48hrs. They duly accepted this and I got a cancellation of contract email. I was then informed that a returns label will be sent out by email within 48hrs. I still haven’t received this & then read the email regarding cancellation of contract noting that if the equipment isn’t returned within 14 days I could be charged £1050 four days have now passed. I also arranged for another broadband supplier who was supposed to have connected me on the 19th December. The new supplier called me to day to say that they will have to cancel the contract I made with then as Vodafone have frozen my landline number and broadband leaving my business before Xmas destroyed. No customers can phone us through our website & we can not send out invoices and 4 quotations for work we were tendering.  I have now phoned this call centre 14 times and have got no further apart from a dubious promised it will be unfrozen on the 19/20th December which gives me no internet until the new year. For all this incompetence they have charged me £45.I have taken hours to try to sort this but now it’s in the hands of trading standards as there’s no doubt I will be seeking compensation for lost of business due to people in a call centre that are utterly untrained to do there job I’m really lost for words living in the U.K. & I will be without an internet connection & phone line for at least 4 weeks in total.,0
"This is the 3rd time Iv posted a review about this lacklustre so called broadband provider ,After hours and hours of mind numbing phone calls trying to sort out my broadband due to lack of strength and being sent a pathetic booster box which hasn’t made any difference in performance i don’t know what to do,, but what I do know that its taken over 3 months now to try and get what Iv been paying for the 30 days I was given to get my money back if I decided to cancel has unsurprisingly lapsed but I’m sure Vodafone know exactly what they are doing so you are trapped for 24 months ,Absolutely disgusting in my eyes .I live in a small 2 bed bungalow and and my Vodafone signal ( fibre 2 ) has trouble going beyond the front room the router is positioned lol it’s a joke , so Vodafone upgrade me to fibre 2 with a booster box 6 and it’s exactly the same , even my ring doorbell is still dropping outDO NOT  and I mean DO NOT waste your money on this diabolically run provider unless you like the piss taken out of you .I had so many people say to me not to go with Vodafone at the start but I thought that I couldn’t be that bad so I give it a go :-(((  I wish I had listened to them now good god !!!",0
"Over the past few days I had the worst experience of my life trying to buy an additional line on my Vodafone account.I bought my line online and asked for porting my number from another network. I never received the eSim on email. I got in touch with Vodafone support via Tobi and the customer rep said you will receive it by end of the day. But I didn't receive receive it.Today I tried to connect with customer support via Tobi and I was shocked by the quality of service.I asked for escalation and complaint, the customer rep was resisting offering £10 as compensation. I continued to insist.To summarise, my issue is still unresolved. The quality of support is horrendous and offshoring support has surgically removed any sense of accountability, quality or ownership from Vodafone.It's a shocking experience. I will cancel both me and my wife's accounts and move my network to a competitor.My trust is completely broken!",0

"Dear Vodafone Customer Service Team,I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the service I have received following my decision to switch to Vodafone for my internet and landline services.I signed up for your service after being assured of a smooth installation process. However, the experience has been anything but satisfactory. Here’s a summary of the issues I have faced:1.	Missed Installation Deadlines:•	An engineer was scheduled to install my services on 12th December but was unable to complete the task, citing a lack of proper equipment. I even provided a ladder to assist, but the installation was still not completed.•	I was informed the issue would be resolved the following week, but this promise was not kept.2.	Repeated Delays:•	Despite contacting your team again, I was assured the problem would be resolved within two days. However, I have now received a text message stating the new installation date is 2nd January.3.	Significant Financial Losses:•	As a business owner who relies on a card payment system, the lack of internet has resulted in a daily loss of approximately £250. This period includes some of the busiest days of the year for my business.Your repeated delays and broken promises have caused me not only financial loss but also reputational damage as I’ve had to turn customers away.What I Expect:•	Immediate prioritization of my installation before the new year, as further delays are unacceptable.•	Fair compensation for the financial losses I have incurred due to your failure to meet your obligations.If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. I trust that Vodafone values its customers and will address this matter seriously.I look forward to your response within 2 worki",0
"Broadband order date was October 13th, OpenReach engineer came out no problem and installed the fibre cables November 29th, however the router box never arrived and was being sent back to Vodafone apparently. The first person (out of a total of 6 after this mess) we spoke to at Vodafone said they would send us a new router box, we had no email confirmation for this so called up again the next day to double check, as we had waited long enough and had been without wifi which when you both work from home, is essential. This person said that the original order had apparently never gone through which we found strange considering we had an order number, confirmation, and already had OpenReach install the fibre cables so how that had happened we do not understand, and it didn't seem anyone at Vodafone understood either. We had a new order made, and were told they would cancel the OpenReach engineer and send us the new router box which would arrive within 3-5 days. No next day delivery was given, which it should have been considering what we had been through. After what we thought was a simple request of re-sending us the router turned into a whole new order, we were hoping it had been resolved - but of course not. We had another email saying an OpenReach engineer would be installing fibre in January 2025.... which we obviously did not need because they had done their job already we were simply waiting on Vodafone to send us this router. We called again to cancel this engineer coming to prevent wasting OpenReach's time, then to be told by Vodafone that we wouldn't be able to get the router box until January now (even though the person the previous day had told us 3-5 days...) because apparently there was a 'problem' with our street and OpenReach needed to come out to sort it... in January?! Completely and utterly ridiculous. Nobody at Vodafone it seems talks to each other or has a scooby about what is going on, as we have been told a different excuse by every person we have spoken to - nothing aligns and therefore I don't believe any of the excuses. If there was a problem with our street this would have been explained in the email, however it was just the generic installation email which meant the whole order was starting from scratch again, even though we had emphasised profusely to Vodafone that all we required was the router box, nothing else. As you can understand at this point we were beyond fed up, we would never have signed up to Vodafone had we known we wouldn't be getting wifi until January, when we made the order in October! The most frustrating thing is that no one seemed to have a clear answer and what should have been a simple fix, turned into a huge headache that led us to cancelling both the broadband and our mobile contract, it has been an awful service. After all of this, at no point was any compensation offered - apart from 10% off our current mobile contract which was a sneaky pitch to sign us up to a further 2 years! Absolutely not. Appalling service wasting not just our time but our money, as we have had to go out to buy a temporary sim to provide us with some wifi whilst we sorted out this mess. Extremely frustrating process which needs a lot of work.",0
"Hello, I applied for home internet from your Vodafone branch and they said it would be £30 per month but 3 home internets were opened in my name, two of them are mobile home internet and the other is normal home internet and the amount I have to pay monthly is £65.

"A falling branch knocked down the fibre line near my property on the 24th November. I reported the fault immediately to the customer service team. It is now 16th December. I have made ten calls to the customer service team, had seven different Openreach engineers visit, been given three different dates to put the cable back up and still the cable has not been reconnected. The first engineer told me that a pole might need to be replaced but a temporary repair could be done in the meantime and would take about an hour. Still the cable has not been reconnected. We are pensioners living in rural Wales and rely heavily on this service as our telephone is VOIP and therefore not working either. Our mobile service is patchy at best and we are concerned that we are now facing Christmas unable to connect with family and friends. The customer service approach is hamstrung by adherence to script and distance from the problem and despite escalating the complaint to a manager we have made no headway whatsoever. I am sick and tired of being told how sorry everybody is for these are just words to dismiss me when what is needed is action to remedy the problem. This level of customer service is deplorable for a global company and I will certainly consider my options when contract renewal is due.I am writing an update to my review having seen the reply from Vodafone. If the respondent had read the review more carefully I made it clear that the fault was reported on 24th November. Storm Darragh occurred on 7th December. That gave a window of two clear working weeks to take action and rectify the problem. Even if a specialist team was needed to put in a new pole, a temporary repair could have been effected to keep us online and this opportunity was not followed up. I have now had four dates promised and passed and I still have no internet or phone. The call count to the customer service line is now up to thirteen and a total of seven hours spent trying to get an answer to this problem. All I keep hearing is ""we are waiting for an update from Openreach"". I have escalated the complaint once again and am now told that someone will be in touch within the next seven days. I cannot help but reflect that if my monthly direct debit had been refused the action would have been far more swift and robust. This whole episode is an absolute masterclass in how to irritate and alienate paying customers who rely on a service which is not being provided. Maybe if the customer service was more focused it would not be necessary to have a team monitoring social media to deflect and excuse poor reviews.",0
"I switched from Sky to Vodafone and was told by sky that my activation date would be 16/12/2024 midnight. As Vodafone told Sky this was my activation date, sky cancelled my service.

"Was a customer for years with no complaints until i moved house. I gave Vodafone 3 weeks notice to switch to my new house. Initial call was a sales call where they upgraded the package and signed me up to a mobile phone contract with them. They passed me through to 'easy switch' team to manage the disconnection and connection at the new property - this was the most laborious and ineffective process i've ever experienced.After going through all the terms and security questions (that I'd already gone through with the sales team) I'd been on the phone for an hour and a half. However, they could only arrange a connection in the next few days (i was moving in 3 weeks) so called me the following tuesday to get a date closer to move-in. I had to go through all the same scripting again on that call and the connection was booked for the day before we moved in.I then received a call/text a few days before the move to say they could no longer offer the arranged connection date. So i had to call them back, go through the same scripted telephone conversation again - afterwhich they told me they could connect a week after we move into the new property.We both work from home so internet is vital (which is why i gave them 3 weeks notice). The 'easy switch' process is anything but. Hours and hours on the phone with them answering the same questions and listening to the same script only for them not toCall handlers failed to understand the simple outcome i (and anyone else moving house) needs, which is ""I want to move in on xxx date and I want the internet to commence before i move in"". Instead, call handlers just talk at you and give you options and information that is not relevant or helpful - over and over again.When i called to complain they didn't really seem to understand what a complaint was and how to handle it. At one point, someone rang me back then put me on hold just to return and say they had referred me to a manager who would ring me back tomorrow. Not much help to me after i'd cancelled the contract!Just a mess of a process and call handlers who didn't seem to grasp what I needed/wanted from their service. I would avoid moving house with them - much simpler and easier to go with a new provider.",0
"I paid £12 to activate 8 days of roaming, but every time I try to use the internet, it says ""No Internet Connection""—despite showing a 5G signal! This is absolutely unacceptable!

I’ve been a loyal Vodafone customer for the last 12 years, and while the first 10 years were decent, the last couple of years have been absolutely terrible.They tricked me into renewing my contract just before I went on holiday, without mentioning the roaming charges had changed. When I returned from my holiday two weeks later and tried to cancel, the store told me it was “too late” and that I’d have to pay almost the full value of a yearly contract to leave.

Awful service I have issues my broadband Internet it keeps dropping connection and I lose connection to devices for sometime now every time I contact them via chatbot to report issue the customer service is OK they go through the same procedure and surly the issue is fixed for couples hours and then it returns.

When I request new router they simply refuse saying its working but as I know its not working adequately. All I would say is I will.avoid renewing my contract with Vodafone in the future. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS.,0
"Sorry Vodafone - ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!  We took out a new Sim the other week - £20 a month for unlimited data, calls, texts etc.Rang today and asked - our 2 existing sims that we’ve had since 2010 (both out of contract), why can’t we change them to the same £20 a month deal?Got told ‘that £20 a month is for new customers only - nothing we can do, best we can do is £23 a month’Thats AWFUL - someone in product should be sacked for that - existing loyal customers should get BETTER deals than new customers to ensure retention.We’ll keep the new Sim as its working fine, but Vodafone will lose the 2 existing SimsIts high time Ofcom stepped in and just like insurance companies  forced phone providers to offer existing customers the same deals as new customers on renewal!In the mean time Vodafone product teams can should ‘read the room’ and do a lot more to ensure customer retention - there’s only so much customer services and sales can do if their hands are tied by poor deals for existing customers!",0
Customer services absolutely appauling. Twice got cut off after call handler couldn't be bothered to keep going after 45 minutes or so -  after agreeing problem was difficult to fix. They literally couldn't be bothered to keep on the call.,0

"I recently ordered a Full fibre broadband from Vodafone. While ordering online, i was told that Vodafone will take care of the switching process and let Virgin media know that i am switching over to Vodafone. Immediatly after the order i got an email from the Virgin Media as well. After the installation, when i spoke to Virgin Media, they mentioned that Vodafone has not notified them of the installation date so they have not siwtched off the service.Vodafone said they can not notify virgin media since its a completly new line and not a take over of Virgin media line.Now i have to pay to Virgin Media for an another month to serve the cancellation notice.Vodafone has completly brushed off their responsibility of providing false information at the time of order and customer service representative after showing the snapshots of the order process stating that Vodafone will take care of switching process and notify Virgin Media said that i should have ordered by calling instead of ordering it through website as information on website may not be accurate.",0
"I upgraded to full fibre 500 on 18 Nov from full fibre 2, I believe it was called.  Well, at least I thought I did...got the new contract, and the new billing but saw none of the promised speeds.  In fact, the download and upload speeds have not changed one bit.  I've been on to vodafone every week since, and have been given all kinds of nonsense excuses. Nobody there seems to want to tell the truth.  I was told service was down in my postcode one time, but my service was not down at all.  I was told the 500 needed 24 - 48 hours to settle in!  A week later (now 4 weeks later), no change.  I was most recently told I had to change from cat V cable to cat VI as the V cable was the problem as it limits the speed.  I purchased cat VI cable and of course, it made no difference at all.  I believe vodafone has now run out of lies and excuses.  I have found online that their routers are crap and can't do the higher speeds.  They deny this but can't explain (or won't say) the real reason the speeds customers are paying for aren't available.   They also won't initiate an investigation with OpenReach to investigate and/or fix the problem.  It took them 6 months to sort our my full fibre connection when I first went full fibre. Crooked company.  I asked to raise a formal complaint about 6 times and they wouldn't do it.  I asked several times what their complaint procedure was and they wouldn't say.  I said I had asked for a formal complaint to be registered and when I asked them on a later chat what the file number was for my complaint, they wouldn't say.  I have found them to be dishonest cheats who can't be bothered with customers.  Avoid vodafone broadband like the plague.  Their full fibre speeds are a lie and their customer service is useless.Update:  I went on to the facebook link provided by vodafone but there was nowhere that I could see to make contact. Why do I need to go onto facebook anyway to have the speed failure escalated?  I have spent hours on the inane chats for 3 or 4 Saturdays in a row!  vodafone knows all about this and continues to bs their way around it. As for their remark about slower speeds than I am expecting!, it's guaranteed speeds that I am paying for! Is nobody in charge there, and is nobody at vodafone honest?  Why has this not already been escalated?  why has a complaint not already been given a case number?  why do I have to go through the same chat bs everytime and the get lied to about the speeds and what the issue is?  Why does vodafone blank out their guaranteed speeds on the chats when the copy is emailed to the customer?  Feels like a fraudulent company to me, at least the broadband arm.",0
Vodafone Fibre experience summary - ABSURD!I placed my order online and Vodafone cancelled it without telling me and when asked why they didn't know. Their customer service just not capable of resolving simple enquiries. Without any hesitation I refused to place another order and went with a different provider instead.,0
"My phone died on Thursday morning, so at the next most convenient time, I spoke to a Vodafone customer service agent, who prepared a new phone for me via the chat. I explained how very urgent this matter was as my phone is critical, not just for my life, but my work.I was assured, everything was fine and they said one was available to collect the same day from a store not far from me. Fantastic! I thought, what service. After running through a million questions and T&C's I was told that they mucked up the order and now the phone was unavailable, even though i was told it was reserved for me. They then suggested I get the phone delivered, next day, to the store of my choice. I told them the store that was close to me, which is in the same City as I work. We went through another round of questions, only to be told this time, that there is a power outage at their HQ, so she couldn't complete the order, but not to worry, she said she would do it later when everything was back up and running. Feeling rest assured, I went back about my day. What could possibly go wrong.Obviously having no phone, I went on my laptop, at home, to get confirmation that my phone was on its way, as promised, only to be told by a different agent, that the order was cancelled and not followed up.Blood pressure starting to rise, I was reassured that if we place the order again, I will have my new phone delivered, as promised, next day. Wow, thank god.We proceed to go through the 3 hour ordering process, again. This time the order was complete and promised for the second time that the phone will be available for me to collect the next day and that I would receive a message, once ready. I explained that my phone was broken, therefor I had no way to receive a notification. Don't worry, she said, just turn up at the store in the afternoon, and it will be there for you.The next day arrived, I left work at 3pm, to walk into the City centre, which would mean I got there at near 4pm. I told the member of staff that i was here to collect my phone, I had a print out of the order confirmation with me for proof, as well as an ID and Bank card. He wandered off into the back room and came back empty handed. He told me that he sorted out the delivery himself and there wasnt anything for me. Absolutely fuming, I got home to speak to another advisor, only to be told, no, It will be Saturday, but you have to wait for a notification.. I dont have a blooooody phone, how will i know???Dont worry, you will get an email.. Brilliant, so i have to stare at my emails all day, on my day off. What a wonderful way to spend it..So, I dont hold out much hope, that my phone will be there tomorrow. Just seems i have been lied to multiple times and scammed into taking out another contract.Did i mention, I have been a customer with Vodafone for around 20 years and this is how I have been treated.Lied to twice, could be a third and not even a grovelling apology or some kind of reimbursement for the loss of money/time.",0
Received a late payment fee because their app wouldn't let me make a payment (infinite looping loading screen(. Live chat advisor told me they do not have the power to remove such a fee. That's predatory practices and I'll be changing provider immediately as I've never had a late payment before.Edit after reply : Vodafone don't care for customers they care about being paid. They just lost a long term loyal customer for life.,0

"Utterly appalling service from Vodafone! I recently changed from another big name Broadband company as their monthly charges has sky rocketed! So on recommendation I tried Vodafone, the date was set for the engineer to fit the equipment in our home as there was drilling to be done, was then told BT Openreach would need to come out to sort the Line to our house but this was going to be external work so we did not need to be home. Was told BT Openreach would be out one day, there was a no show was then told it would be another week, that day came and went, I contacted vodafone for them to confirm it was going to be yet another week, In total it was 3 weeks and still no BT Openreach...what a shoddy service! I then cancelled for Vodafone to say okay then....a brand new customer who they ere not willing to help and support in any way possible.",0
"Disgusting incompetent service, no complaint call back issued. Advisors lied and no notes left. Very poor excuse of a company, spent hours everyday for a week to resolve the matter. Manager call backs promised by Paras, not issued. Escalating to ombudsman.",0
"I’d like to share my experience with Vodafone and CityFibre regarding my broadband installation and the ongoing issues I’ve faced since then.On Friday, 6th December, CityFibre engineers installed FTTP at my property, which took 1 hour 45 minutes as it was an overhead fibre installation. The Vodafone package promises speeds of 900Mbps, but testing on Ookla showed only 450Mbps. Initially, everything seemed fine, but by the weekend, the internet went down for several hours. After calling Vodafone, it coincidentally came back during the call. I decided to give it time, thinking it might be provisioning.However, on Monday, 9th December, the internet went down again from 8am. My neighbour, who has the same package, experienced the same issue and managed to get an engineer booked for Tuesday, 10th December. When I contacted Vodafone, I was told CityFibre hadn’t completed the job for my address. After several calls, I was advised to wait three days for their Artificial Intelligence system to fix the issue—an absolute joke!On Wednesday, 11th December, a CityFibre engineer called, claiming to be outside my house. However, he was confused and accidentally contacted the wrong customer. When he did arrive, he found that my ONT box hadn’t been provisioned properly during installation. This explained the intermittent service. He resolved it, but on Thursday, 12th December, the internet went down again at 8am.The back-and-forth between Vodafone and CityFibre has been exhausting. Vodafone repeatedly blamed CityFibre, while CityFibre insisted there was no issue. Neither party took responsibility, and I had to push Vodafone to escalate the issue each time. Diagnostics tests were run over and over, but the problem persisted—a flashing red alarm light on the fibre box.To make matters worse, I bumped into a CityFibre engineer on the road, and he confirmed the ONT boxes in my area needed replacing. However, he couldn’t proceed because Vodafone hadn’t submitted the necessary report. Vodafone also refuses to confirm conversations or actions by email, citing internal policies.Despite being within the 14-day cooling-off period, Vodafone has made it nearly impossible to cancel my contract, claiming their system won’t allow it.I’m sharing this to raise awareness about the appalling service from both Vodafone and CityFibre. The lack of communication, accountability, and professionalism has been incredibly frustrating. If this doesn’t improve soon, I’ll be forced to escalate the matter further.",0
"Pathetic useless company can't register my SIM card. Constantly getting prompts saying number not valid etc. yet my phone says Vodafone, and they take money from my balance after buying a bundle. No bundle added to my account. Called customer services they hung up on me after being on hold 20 minutes.can't find account number doesn't exist despite porting in from another network. I should never switched to this network. I've now escalated this to a complaint, next it's ofcom.",0
"My wife and I have been customers of Vodafone for many years, but our recent experience has greatly undermined our trust and confidence in them . My wife had a contract for a mobile data device to which an 'entertainment package' for Spotify had been wrongly applied by Vodafone without her knowledge of consent. This is at the same time that Vodafone was also applying a fee for a Spotify to her mobile phone contract and to my mobile phone contract. She has complained but so far they have not apologised or refunded several hundred pounds for which we feel we have been overcharged. As Vodafone know, it is not possible to use Spotify via a mobile data device. Nor is it possible to have more that one Spotify account registered a single email address held by my wife. Whilst refusing to refund us, they do not seem to be able to prove that the entertainment contract was requested by us nor give any sensible account of why a single customer would have sought to pay for more that one Spotify account through different contracts.I no longer trust this company and trying to resolve this issue through their customer service team has been shambolic and disappointing.",0
VODAFONE are the worst phone company in Britain even more 💩 than KCON as I couldn't even get Broadband and phone landline service with them and they are also liars as they say you can now take any number to anywhere in the country well BT confirms this is rubbish so all I can say I only had a mobile with them that's now CEASED and is now with with EE! Don't be fooled by their lying false promises as they have given me the worst 😤 service of any company in the last fifty years avoid them like the plague and sign up with BT like I did do not use crap VODAFONE,0
"WORSE THAN GHONORREA! Once you have them it is impossible to get rid of them. I've tried three times to cancel with them with no avail, which is 3h of my precious time that I'm not getting back. The service during the years I had them was bad and they very quickly started raising prices, even before the fixed period contract was over last year. Would recommend to Hitler, Stalin and Jeffrey Epstein.",0

"Just about had a f-ing nough of this useless company,  since i had my contract nothing but issues repairing network every two weeks no signal or weak, for the last two years!! they cut the service completely two weeks ago, NO NOTIFICATION OF ANY WORK  BEFORE HAND TO BE CARRIED OUT!! had two weeks on no signal missing work calls and elderly mum being ill, so couldn't keep in touch with her, after weeks the signal gone again, more work to be carried out for two days, had a text this time to say hours after noticing network gone again, have to sit up stairs with my arm out the friggin widow for crap connection, wtf is wrong with company!!! i don't live on a friggin island on on a council estate, just so sick of this garbage network provider,  as i said the last time how long it will last, the antenna is just around the corner from me 200 feet away. they still take their money monthly though no issues there. so pizzed off right now !!! I would not recommend this company to anybody at anytime !! This isn't just a one off, it's been continuous for over 2 years !!!",0
"This morning our wifi went down and it turns out that vodafone have accidentally closed our account instead of starting a new one. They have admitted it was their mistake but have now said they cannot get us up and running again until the 31st December which is 3 weeks away! We live in a house with very low signal so we are unable to data hotspot and 2 people work permanently from home. I am absolutely appalled that there is nothing they can do to reactivate our account or fast track us to a new account when it was their mistake and they are leaving us in a position with no wifi for 3 weeks over Christmas. Absolutely no customer service or consideration for their customers to rectify this issue which was their own mistake to start with, beyond disappointed, stay away from this company.",0

"Vodafone have to be one of THE absolute worst mobile phone providers currently in the UK and I'd urge anyone who's considering signing up with them to think twice about doing it!  I had several months of a nightmare time with them, trying to get my, what I thought was a no contract SIM deal with them, sorted out so that I could actually make & receive calls & texts without problems but that never happened.  I had NOTHING but major problems and couldn't make or receive calls or texts, plus they had apparently opened 2 accounts for me and had the nerve to be taking money from my bank account every month too.  I spent mind-numbing hours & hours on their 'chat' service online, 'chatting' to endless various agents, trying to get the issue sorted out, I got endlessly passed from one seemingly barely English speaking agent to another, having all sorts of promises of quick resolution, etc, made but with nothing ever being resolved.I finally pulled the plug and demanded Vodagfone cancel whatever accounts / contracts they had for me and I blocked them from taking money from my bank account for a ZERO service they ever provided me with.  The 'manager' I 'chatted' to online when I told them I was done with them and that they couldn't charge me an early cancellation fee (as I shouldn't have had a contract anyway, and they never provided me with a working service either!) tried to insist that I would have to pay a fee for early cancellation but I made sure in no uncertain terms that he knew they couldn't do that in the circumstances.  He ultimately gave in and said that I would be charged no such fee.  However, fast forward about 6 months and, lo & behold, I received a letter the other day (right before Christmas!) from Lowells (debt collectors who had sent several letters previously until I told them what the circumstances were and I was told they wouldn't contact me again!) claiming I still owe Vodafone around £25.00.  Needless to say, I'm contacting them AGAIN to reiterate that I do NOT owe Vodafone anything after the torturous fiasco and non-service I experienced with them.So, having anything to do with Vodafone can be like a recurring nightmare that you just cannot be rid of.  AWFUL company, AWFUL service and AWFUL money-grabbing, dishonest, incompetent company.",0
"Open reach have been out to fit my mums Internet and did a lazy install now all the network is down no cctv nothing, because they removed all the patch cables from the switch then put a router at the far corner of a house with double thick stone walls so it has feck all reach he clearly dont have a clue what he was doing. That house has had over 100k spent on it innthe last 2 year and hes just ruined it now it means we will have to chissel chases into finished rooms pull up new flooring  then re plaster and re decorate all because the lazy so called 1hour course ""engineer"" couldn't be bothered to do it right. There is a proper desinated place where it needs to be like the old one was so it can feed 2 ports that run to managed switches it would have take him 10 mins extra tops, can this contract be cancelled the installer basically fobbed my mum off, oh and i want all the patch cables back please, he could see it has a professionally installed network which was done when the house had a full rewire a year ago, you have ruined what was a perfect home, Stop calling your installers engineers they are not even close to a engineer, you have caused problems the house has never had, get it sorted and move it to the correct position",0

"Absolutely terrible customer services - a scripted hell of obfuscation, incompetence and dishonesty!I purchased a new phone contract and requested to port my existing mobile number.The port was scheduled for 5th December... before 4pm on the account portal, before 5pm via text, before midnight in another text and within 48hrs according to customer services.They managed to cut the number off on the 5th - so I stopped getting business calls/texts and despite calling and chatting via web every day  - nothing changed until the 11th... i'm now getting my work calls - but have lost mobile internet.The customer services team really do not have a clue, the fact they try and upsell other vodafone junk mid-complaint is utterly mind boggling!!

"Shambles of a company!I contacted Vodafone on their drive for getting full fibre broadband business.   They checked to see if my postcode and address were compatible and offered a great deal that I couldn’t refuse.  They said they would contact my current provider (BT) to cancel and all I had to do was wait 3 weeks for the arranged date.  A week later the router arrived, no problem.  Next week I got a text to tell me that they couldn’t get hold of BT to cancel so I should do it myself.  Did that and arranged cancellation for 10th of December (Vodafone were meant to instal the fibre on 25th Nov), this took me about an hour between being on hold and answering questions so thanks to both BT and Vodafone for that one.  A few days before the instal date, I got another text to say that due to complications with citifibre, there was an issue and they couldn’t make that date.  The fix was on the 28th nov and Vodafone would contact me then to re arrange the instal date.  I mentioned to them the cancellation date with BT so everything needed to be in for then.  No problem they said.No call on the 28th and then on the 4th of December I received a text from citifibre and Vodafone to simply say my order had been cancelled.  After waiting an age on their hold I got through to them for them to blame everything on citifibre and take no responsibility and say I was cancelled and had to deal with it myself.  They’re weren’t interested in discussing any further and only gave me some useless and meaningless apologies.  I had to call BT and start a new contract which of course leaves me cut off for a week between cancel date and new start date.  Cheers Vodafone you useless bunch of liars.",0
"I have been a loyal customer of Vodafone for 15 years, but my opinion has drastically changed since August. My first negative experience occurred when I was charged twice for roaming services during the same period. They insisted that the service had been activated on two separate occasions, leading to a frustrating phone call that lasted nearly an hour and a half as I fought to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident.On October 20th, I made the decision to leave Vodafone due to my initial negative experience and the consistently poor service in my area. To begin the process, I reached out to Vodafone's AI assistant, Toby, and subsequently sent a text to a designated number to inquire about the final payment required to terminate my service. Despite my long-standing relationship with the company, I can no longer overlook the trouble I have facedI received a message and an email confirming that if I decided to leave their service, my charges would amount to £0. Thankfully, I had the foresight to keep both of these records. However, just three weeks later, I was shocked to receive a bill for £327, claiming that I had broken my contract. This was surprising, especially since I have clear proof indicating that my early termination fee is indeed £0.After numerous phone calls and a visit to the Vodafone store, where staff took the time to verify my claims, I finally spoke with a helpful lady from customer service. She listened attentively as I explained my situation and, with a reassuring tone, confirmed that I was indeed correct—there would be no bill for me to worry about. It felt like a relief to have my concerns validated after all the back-and-forth.Just when I believed that my issues with Vodafone were finally resolved, I received yet another bill, this time for £77. Confused and frustrated, I decided to call their customer service to inquire about this new charge. To my dismay, they not only mentioned the £77 bill but also informed me of an additional charge of £327, completely disregarding the challenges and frustrations I’ve faced throughout this entire ordeal with them. At this moment, I am in the process of collecting all the necessary evidence and have requested the recorded conversations related to my issue. I plan to take this matter to the Ombudsman for further investigation. I urge all of you, dear readers, if you value your time and well-being, please consider avoiding Vodafone.",0
"Horrific broadband service, just finished 24 month contract. So happy and relieved to have escaped.Constant connection drops (no issues with previous or post broadband provider)Getting through to someone requires you to go through the most irritating AI chat and takes ages, when you get through, security questions are over the top and too many in comparison to any other service out there. The whole complaints service takes so long and is so infuriating, I think they do it on purpose, or I would of complained a whole of a lot more.Mobile phone service was good.",0

"What an experience I just had with an online advisor at Vodafone.My contract was up for renewal and I was presented with an offer via the app, it was a sim only offer as I recently upgrade my phone . The plan was set out and was highlighted it was similar apart from they removed the entertainment package( Spotify)Since picking the plan it was fine until I received a message stating I was 80% nearing my spend allowance and to that effect my data was cut off.I eventually got online to check and it appeared Vodafone missed out my world traveler options so now i get charged a ridiculous amount for data roaming.So I reached out and got the usual you are out of the 14 day grace period sir!You’ll have to pay a cancellation few, ok that’s fine what is that £768….you can imagine my reaction when I heard that.I stayed calm, or as calm as you’d expect, and explained to them I have been at sea for the past 2 weeks hence why I didn’t catch this earlier.Bear in mind I have been with Vodafone for 20+ years and also have my broadband with them.I was told my only option was, merge your account into another plan, it will cost a bit but at least it will save you from leaving us and  paying the cancellation fee.At this point I had to leave the conversation, basically sounds like the uk labour government has hijacked Vodafone.So if anybody that is looking to upgrade don’t trust the recommendation tariff they pick for you, as it will mostly definitely be wrong and like myself they will trap you in a 24 month contract. Some might say it’s my own fault for not reading terms and conditions but having done this serval times before without issues I wasn’t expecting it.I hope sharing my experience helps others avoid the same mistake.Do I recommend Vodafone yes I do as I have had no issues until now i just thought they would be able to apply the world traveller to my account and it would be fine.",0
"Going round in circles with Vodafone trying to sort out the simple matter of keeping my phone number on a new plan. My port in request was cancelled and so naturally they deactivated my sim card without telling me, so I'm stuck unable to make calls/text/data roaming and paying for something I can't even use!Every time I speak to someone, I'm told something different about the cause and/or solution. They have very dodgy policies designed to extract as much money out of people as possible.I've spent hours trying to sort this with no success and certainly no help from customer services, who promise one thing one day and send me on a wild goose chase the next. The early termination fee is high but seriously seems worth it at this stage! Save yourself the headache and avoid Vodafone like the plague!Update: 11 days on and Vodafone has not resolved my issues. They have given me 2 new sim cards but have been unable to activate them, they've sent me to my nearest store to sort it out in person but I still don't have a sim that works. The links in the reply to my original post  were useless and I was signposted to another account. Would give 0 stars if that was an option. Total time wasters, can't trust them to do anything right.",0

"I have 3 lines with them and are loyal customer for years as I don’t often want to change but unfortunately this time I’m very disappointed. Since I renew the contract, I have entertainment to choose from but it never worked regardless how many time I contacted them , it never sorted out, they said someone will call to follow up and sort out for me but no one called , I kept calling them and nothing happened. It has been Almost 1 year now . I will not sty with them when my contract finished .Plus the quality isn’t and good like before, 5g speed is slow, often get no signal in some area, price are expensive even you are loyal customer.

The plot thickens! They cancel my broadband deal because it was incorrectly submitted!!!! I just brought on there website!

"Dear Vodafone and CityFibre,My name is Ramazan K****, and I subscribed to Vodafone's ""Full Fibre 910 Mbps"" plan on November 6, 2024.I was informed via SMS, email, and phone calls that an engineer from CityFibre would visit my property on November 22, 2024, to install and activate the internet connection. On the scheduled date, two engineers from CityFibre arrived, but they encountered a blockage in the underground duct running from the internet distribution box on the corner of a nearby street to the front of my house. As a result, they could not pass the fiber cable through. They assured me that a team would return within a week to resolve the issue.Since then, both Vodafone and CityFibre—who were very attentive and communicative up until that point—have seemingly disappeared. Despite contacting customer services via phone and written communication, and even reaching out on social media, my issue remains unresolved.I want to stress that no one has come to address the issue since November 22. Please refrain from saying, ""Our team has looked into this,"" unless there is concrete evidence of action.I work from home, and this delay has caused significant disruptions to my professional life. If this issue can be resolved, I urge you to take immediate steps to fix it. I also request a clear, concrete explanation regarding the situation.If this problem cannot be resolved, please inform me transparently so I can cancel my subscription and explore other options.Thank you !",0

"Avoid Vodafone broadband at all costs.If there was an option for zero stars, this is what it would be!Since the beginning of the contract they failed to deliver on the minimum guaranteed speed. Connection dropped completely due to a Vodafone tower fault and they failed to accept responsibility and kept pushing back to open reach. The poor open reach engineer came to our house multiple times despite advising there were 12 other houses in the area, all on Vodafone, all with the same problem, yet all other providers were working as they should be. Again, Vodafone were taking no responsibility for this.Even when complaining, they wanted to charge us the early termination fee of £259! After 30 HOURS of phone calls Vodafone finally accepted liability and waived the termination fee, allowing us to switch to a provider who could actually deliver on their promises,  happy ending right? WRONG. Vodafone have since sent two bills and tried to collect the £259 from my account! 3 more HOURS of phone calls and “someone will call me back in 5 business days” I won’t hold my breath.Absolutely ridiculous from a well established company. Think twice before going with a company who have not an ounce of customer care in them.",0
"Vodafone is pathetic again. I was forced to upgrade to the more expensive fibre wifi package because of pathetic internet speed and persistent connection dropping on their lower priced fibre. I am now on over £40 per month with an advertised 900 mb per second speed and a connection booster.  I am currently struggling to write this review because of very slow speed and the connection perpetually dropping (PO6 4TL). I cannot attend my crucial online meetings. If you contact them, they are arrogant, dismissive and never admit their shortcomings. Please stay very far away from Vodafone. Update: same problem today. I am on 4G now as my wifi is mostly off today. Thank you very much for nothing Vodafone",0
"I recently contacted Vodafone to change my number due to an ex partner constantly calling me off withheld on my previous number everything got changed and I was told it's gone through. At 9pm last night I get a notification that I can not use my phone for any inbound or outbound calls, I contact Vodafone who say that due to a fraud investigation I would not be able to use my phone for 7 days for either incoming or outgoing calls. I'm a carer for a vulnerable adult family member and Vodafone have caused extreme stress doing this last night I was filled with worry that my family member may need to contact me and as Vodafone have blocked everything they wouldn't be able to get through and I wouldn't be able to help them this has caused so much stress for me and my family, I havent slept all night and when I called Vodafone they hung up on me after i explained everything then got through to another agent, who wouldn't allow me to speak to a manager and shrugged it off that it'll take 7 days. I NEED MY PHONE FOR AT LEAST INCOMING CALLS SO I CAN SUPPORT A VULNERABLE FAMILY MEMBER. Awful service I will be raising this to the Financial ombudsman and FCA!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I wish there was a negative star for this broadband company. They are totally pressurising to sell and install a broadband in my property. I have written to them, I have called them on the phone numerous times. I have also been to the local shop to cancel my installation on 20th December, 2024. They are are very difficult and earless company to deal with. I have spent few hours on their website to convince them that: I DO NOT NEED A VODAFONE BROADBAND INSTALLED IN MY PROPERTY. But still sent me a letter yesterday saying that they will come to install the broadband in my property. I am just getting sick and tired of this company. Please some one help me to get through to these people, and cancel my installation. They do not listen - In my language it is called a pressurising sale, which was illegal in the UK. I do not know what else to write. I do not wish to have a vodafone broadband installed in my property. Thank You!Thanks for your reply, but unfortunately I do not use or deal anything on the facebook - facebook should be called an open book...",0
Terrible unreliable service provider. Have not connected my broadband. Also very poor mobile network. Don’t bother with them,0
"Not reliable at all, I don't have service atlist 4 days in a month and internet as well, sometimes they need more than a week to fix it. Poor customer service. I can't even receive calls from my child 😕",0
"I have been experiencing severe issues with Vodafone's mobile internet service at East Croydon Station for the past four months. Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts, SIM swaps, and regular contact with customer service and technical support, the problem remains unresolved. The mobile internet connection is either non-existent or extremely slow, severely impacting my ability to work as a self-employed black cab driver.In addition to contacting customer service every week and sending numerous emails, I have now lodged a formal complaint with Ofcom, the UK telecommunications regulator, due to Vodafone's lack of response and inability to resolve the issue. I also requested to terminate my contract due to the service issues but was told I would need to pay a £180 termination fee, which I find unacceptable given the lack of service.If you're considering Vodafone for your mobile internet needs, think very carefully. In my experience, the service has been unreliable, and the customer support unhelpful. Save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable options.",0
"I am going around in circles with there complaints department a guy called Huzefa where he states my broadband purchase was cancelled because it wasn't set up correctly, but won't elaborate on why, what was the issue? This is ironic when I questioned a incorrect price they then cancel the deal!",0
"Oh dear after a marathon install of untold hours, nothing will work.  Some numpty has decided that Russians will be outside my country home so I must have a 12 digit password. Problem is I would have to reconnect 50 IOT devices that use an 8 digit password, and re-enter more than 150 routines with over 800 commands in. No, thank you.  Just get an unlimited SIM for £18 and find an old phone.",0
Unfortunately the worst internet coverage I have ever encountered. Internet connection drops multiple times a day. The speed is so slow you can't make calls over the internet. As somebody who is working from home constantly having to apologise for my internet provider. The internet you pay for should not be this poor in this day and age. Taking ten minutes to send an email is no joke! Today I couldnt purchase something and had to phone up to complete as the internet timed out on the sale. This is just a few of the issues when trying to use Vodafones internet service. Certainly would not move to them for mobile based on this experience. No point phoning as have not been able to reach a solution to date. They are happy taking my money for a sub standard service.Again missing the point that I am writing this review after the many times of reaching out to Vodafone by phone and email. Just another standard response to a review with no care for the reason why the customer is writing it!My opinion is even lower of Vodafone after this response. I have had nearly a year of poor internet. So not sure when it is going to be better when you say it is variable. Banging my head against a brick wall trying to get any sort of resolution.Didn't think it was possible for Vodafone service to get any worse. Now two and a half hours without reliable internet. Vodafone have now after many previous emails decided my account details aren't correct so can't correspond by email. You couldn't make this stuff up! Avoid at all costs. They are useless by phone and email. Complete lack of customer care,0
Completely messed up my entire home move. Have been with Vodafone for years but this has been an absolute shambles. Will not be paying them and definitely not keeping the contract.,0
"Vodafone Broadband - don't even think about it!All was brilliant until - Activation date. Engineer came on time at 8am, discussed my requirements, then told me nothing could happen by Open Reach for 2 to 3 weeks!! I now have a new date more than 4 weeks later but have no faith that they will turn up, complete the connection and activate the service. Meanwhile Virgin are now charging me some extortionate out of contract rate. I'm not holding my breath about promised compensation from Vodafone either.",0
"I would avoid at all costs, awful. Had problems since the installers installed in wrong place having to ring up about 5 different occasions hour long phone calls, write 3 complaint forms the latest one was 11 days ago and no response. Brought best internet and it can’t even get signal in a small flat. Awful customer service.",0
"Horrendous service. Horrendous customer service. One even told me to ""mind my words"" when I said the service was rubbish. The router drops connection all the time. Even in the same room. Only got this because virgin don't cover our area. Cancelled.",0
"Promise one phone send a different.  Contract says one thing and they send something else, then deny the facts. So disrespectful.  Three members of staff confirmed the phone doesn't match the contract including the branch manager. But then send the big guns to deny and lie totally ignore facts. No interest in resolving problem.Even the branch manager agreed it was wrong and refused to rectify as in his words I don't trust them. I've only been a Vodafone customer for 26years, never defaulted. But this is typical of such large companies they don't care or respect loyalty.Having researched Vodafone it appears they often mislead people to sign then up.I really do question there 4+ stars when 35% give ONE STAR reviews.AVOID",0
"I keep ringing to speak to someone with sense. 1 in 10 calls you might get someone with common sense, but I doubt it. Small minds think we all have social media. Not everyone is a follower. I REPEAT small minded people. NO SOCIAL MEDIA IN MY WORLD.",0
"Been suffering from constant disconnection issues from our new Power Hub.Can’t watch films or game, without multiple disconnections, it’s frustrating. We have contacted their tech team, going through all different settings, still does it! Now my sons PlayStation 5 won’t connect at all, however fine at a friends house!!Looking online, this seems to be a common problem with Vodafone’s power hub. Rather than looking at their own kit, they lay blame on our connection and attempt to upsell us, to the next bundle. My question is why? The line remains the same? Just the router that’s different, which sounds very suspect to me!Power Hub is not fit for purpose!!I have been tempted, on many occasions to just end the contract and pay the fee, it’s that bad!!Previous routers with BT, EE and Sky, no problem at all!Next stage, I will have to escalate this to their complaints department followed by Ofcom. Only 3 months into a 2 year contractI would not recommend Vodafone broadband with the PowerHub if you want to keep your sanity!! Just google other reviews, shameful30/12 - Update, after allegedly monitoring our home WIFI since the 27th December, apparently there is not problem, yet any streaming device gets thrown off the wifi intermittently.  They saying my house is the problem and I must purchase boosters from them.  I explained my TV is 10 ft away from the router in the same room, yet Vodafone are laying blame at my property! Why would I need to boost a signal 10ft, oh and it must be a Vodafone booster not third partyIn a nutshell, it looks like their products are not fit for purpose.  They sell wifi cheap, lock you in with a contract, it does not work, so they try and get more money out of youInternet speed, according to their checks are fine, yet I have speed checks, carried out on the Vodafone app, sitting next to the router, as below:-29/12 @ 10:20 - 4.6 mps29/12 @ 10:18 - 9 mbs29/12 @ 10:17 - 6.6 mbs29/12 @ 10:16 - 15.3 mbsAll other times, upwards of 60 mbsStay well away!!

AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!!!!",0
"Do not ever use this company. Been with them 15 years plus. I have 2 device  plans with them. If u are late paying for it by 2 or 3 days they threaten court action.

Staff very helpful but systems a complete joke. Kept crashing. Took over an hour to upgrade two Sums and buy a phone… terrible experience for a “tech” company…,0
"Been with them 2 years, bad signal and terrible support. Avoid them. I will never go back.In this 2 years I could compare with my other phone, 90% of situations when vodafone had no signal the other one did.Also when I ended the contract they did they best to stop me and delay me and a month later still owe me from my last invoice about 20 gbp.  Avoid them like the plague.",0
"If there were zero stars, I would rate that. I'm leaving vodafone, trying to return their equipment, as I don't just want to chuck it in a bin. I understand they're supposed to offer this recycling service. (They probably just send the waste to a third world country landfill site, but that's their choice.) I can't even get them to sort this simple request out. The Tobi chatbot is useless. The human advisor just stopped the chat and completely ignored me. What's the point of wasting my time any more. Into the bin, and landfill, it goes.",0

"Until today Vodafone would be getting 5 stars from me. I have been a customer for over 15 years and have never once had a complaint about the service.Today however they have sent me a threatening email after I upgraded my broadband telling me that if I don't return some wireless dongle that I never asked for - and which never worked as they didn't send me a SIM for it. Vodafone are threatening to charge me unless I return this useless bit of plastic to them... In a box with its leaflets... 2 years after it was originally sent to me.Their contract terms are absolutely clear that they cannot demand return of equipment beyond the 14 day contract cooling off period:""3.7 Equipment. We will supply the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone equipment to you. You can use your own router to receive the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone Services but you must: (i) ensure it is compatible; and (ii) use your Vodafone router in order to display speed information on the Vodafone Broadband app. If you are a Vodafone Fibre to the Home Broadband customer (previously known as Vodafone Gigafast Broadband): (a) speed information will not be available on the Vodafone Broadband app; and (b) you will need to use the Vodafone router in order to use the phone services. You must not connect equipment to our network that may harm it, or anyone else's equipment or services. If the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone Services are terminated (by you or us) prior to activation or during the 'cooling off period' (see 7.3(a) below) or due to any unavailability issue, you must return all equipment which you have received under your Agreement. Failure to return any equipment when requested to do so may result in charges in line with our Returns Policy7.2. Return of Equipment. If the Home Broadband and Phone Services are terminated by you or us prior to your service activation date or within 14 days of your service activation date then you must return any Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone equipment to us within 30 days of cancellation. If you do not return the equipment within 30 days or if it is damaged when you do return it, you will be charged a reasonable fee as set out in the Price Guide. We'll advise you on how to return any equipment on cancellation.""I have now wasted 2 hours on webchat and phone trying to get to the bottom of this and frankly I expect better.",0
"Beware of switching to Vodafone. If something go wrong you’ll be left without a working phone for days, and will be fobbed off with fix timescales that they don’t observe. It seems like nobody knows what is going on.There is no sense of urgency, they don’t seem to care.",0

"Atrocious customer service!Phoned this company three times in a week about overcharges on my contract. Spent 40+ minutes on each of the first two calls. Promised calls back with resolution but nothing. Third time today - they promised to call me back again and have not.My advice is to avoid this company at all costs - they have no idea what customer service is. Maybe it’s because I don’t use my phone a great deal, who knows, but they couldn’t care less. Even the retentions department are not bothered. Good luck to phone company 3 in your merger with this lot.",0
"Took out business broadband with them In Feb after being told lies that I could have it at the new address I was moving to - I checked multiple times before taking out the contract but when we came to add at the new place I was told it wasn't an option!Requested cancelation straight away and finally on Nov 20 I was told this could be cancelled and no fees to pay as I was being charged for a contract I couldn't and had never used!I had called over 10 times before and told this and was assured everything was now settled.Now on the phone with them today 06/12 because I have a debt agency contact me and I have missed payments on my credit file.Customer service is shocking and no doubt outsourced somewhere abroad so its hard to understand them and I spend hours of my time going round in circles, same with online chat.I am a personal Vodafone customer and been with them for over 20 years!I'm appalled by my experience and that no one in customer services seems to care of the effects this is having to my life, my credit file and the hours I have spent trying to fix this.1 Hour and 3 agents in and we still aren't fixed...Shame on you Vodafone!",0

"Between January 2015 and November 2017 Vodafone took £2,908.07 from my bank account which was £96.93 per month. The last month I paid them, they took £533.16. At this point I had to walk away from their services because I simply couldn’t afford to pay. This was for use of my phone when I was briefly on holiday. They then proceeded to pursue me for a debt of £1891.05 for unpaid charges. This amounted to a total of £4,799.12 of charges over 30 months which worked out at £159.97 per month. This legalised theft has since been regulated although there are still ex customers like me still being pursued through the high court for these ridiculous charges. Needless to say, Vodafone do not care about you as an individual and are only interested in exploiting you for monetary gain. I strongly recommend that customers do not sign up with Vodafone.",0
"Adoid Vodafone for broadband. I have broadband at my current house and wanted to move the service to the house we are moving into, however Vodafone could not offer the same service at the new house. They charged me a huge cancellation fee because they tie you into long unfair contracts. They need to stick to mobile phones and leave broadband to companies that know what they are doing and look after their customers.",0
"I had 24 months broadband contract with Vodafone I completed the contract and I paid the bills regularly. Following I had the option to continue on one month basis contract cancellation notice. I give one month notice to terminate the contract and I paid the last bill.Vodafone didn't terminate the contract and kept charging me for a service I never used. Now I received a JCC warrant notice to pay over £500, completely dishonest and fraud.I have contacted Vodafone and I have wrote a letter to the head office regarding this. Will wait and see.",0

"I have worst experience with vodaphone. I bought a contract sim 3 months ago from the outlet in bullring near selfridge side from a girl. At the time of contract i asked from her after how long i would be eligible to get a phone on instalments. She misguided me and told me only after 3 moths you can get a new phone. I asked 3 times from her and she replied same. After 3 months i went there and now they are saying that after 6 months i will get phone. I told them about thae words of that girl and and they sais that girl was new. She might dont know about it.such an irresponsible behaviour. If the girl did not lie at that time, i would go somewhere else and get the contract with phone. Internet connectivity of vodaphone is hell. It all the time disconnecting. I am unable to call my mother back home.when i reported the issue, they said to buy a wifi connectionMeans seriously, how can they be so mean to just bind the people in contract and not providing the exact service for which they are paying for.worst experience.

I have NEVER even been late on any payments nor missed a payment for anything. I have received my confirmation email from vodafone thanking me for my order, email confirming date and time of installation, contractinformation, account set up confirmation. They claim they sent a text and email advising that the credit check failed but these have not been received. When I asked them to confirm the number and email address they were sent to they would only say the ones on the account.I raised a complaint and received a call. The advisor gave no further information  regarding what has gone wrong. I have completed a credit check appeal via their website as advised but even if (when) it comes back as an error, I will be refused vodafone for 3 months!Don't waste your time, take your custom elsewhere.",0

"I cancelled my broadband contract in October as I was moving out of a flat and wanted to use a different provider.Due to a problem on Vodafone's end it didn't cancel properly despite receiving confirmation of cancellation.

So I've paid them nearly £200 extra for no reason and it's on me to chase them up because there's ""nothing they can do"".The people you talk to are actually trying to help, but the structure Vodafone has set up seems designed to make you frustrated in the hope you'll give up and pay them extra.Other providers have figured out how to make it simple for customers, Vodafone don't want to. I can bet they've made a huge amount of money from vulnerable people who are unable to track everything and end up just capitulating.",0

I was thinking of switching to Vodafone broadband and got most of the way through the process of buying a plan but it said there was an issue with the basket and their website seemed slow. I tried using the chat to see what the issue was but got nowhere as the call centre were not helpful about the security questions. I have been a customer of their mobile phone service for decades. I will probably just stick with my current broadband provider because I don't need the stress.,0
Based on my experience Vodafone does not make it easy for a new Broadband customer.They cancelled my order suddenly and make me jump through hoops just to question why.I was subjected to inflexible security checks and asked for a PIN (which I wasn't given) and a whole list of questions and requirements for ID proof in response to asking a simple question about what happened to my order.,0

Yet my credit record on checkmyfile is still showing the erroneous information. .",0
Vodafone advertise unlimited broadband but the service I received was extremely limited - almost every day the broadband failed at random times for 20 minutes and some days I had no service at all. Trying to get help is a nightmare as they rely on AI and a call centre in India so the seasons changed while they tried (unsuccessfully) to sort out the various problems. I have returned to my previous provider and have had a full uninterrupted service from day 1. Don’t use Vodafone for broadband.,0
"I took out a Vodafone contract in January at £36 per month, which later increased to £38. While that was still a reasonable deal, everything went downhill after I missed one payment. Since then, Vodafone has been adding late fees every single month for the previous month, driving my bill up to over £42 per month.I tried reaching out through live chat and even on X (formerly Twitter), hoping to resolve the issue, but their customer service was unhelpful and uninterested in finding a solution. Instead of valuing a loyal customer, they seemed more content with losing one.Sadly, I’ve had no choice but to switch networks because the rising costs made the contract no longer worth it. A real shame, I expected better from such a large provider. I wouldn’t recommend Vodafone to anyone who values transparent billing and responsive customer service.",0
"iPhone 14 Pro Max had an issue where the screen turned green, phone was still under manufacturing warranty. Went to the Vodafone store with the phone (I had not damaged the phone other than it had tiny scratches on it which weren’t visible unless looking for them) and they said the manufacturing defect warranty does not cover the cost of a new screen (which they said it needed).Supposedly, even though I had not damaged the phone which they said, due to the scratches the argument is that is most likely what it was. Took it to both Sky and Apple and they had said had it been bought from them it would have been covered under their warranty.Very disappointed, shows that there isn’t really much point in having the warranty.",0
"I phoned up to buy broadband and was offered an upgrade on my handset. I specifically asked for the lowest priced airtime plan and only found out they did not sign me up to this one until later. I asked if they could just amend the airtime plan to the cheapest one and they said no. They said I had to physically drive to the shop and the shop could amend the airtime plan and I could keep the handset. Drove to the shop who said not only they can’t do that but I couldn’t give them the handset to cancel the contract I had to go home and phone them and then post the handset. I have now been on the phone an hour and a half being told there is nothing they can do I have to wait in 2 days for collection then wait up to a further 14 days for the device to be credited to my account before I can even re order. In this time I will be charged the new plan until my account is reverted back to normal. I have never known such bad service and complicated rules in any other company. Ironically my husband is a Vodafone pensioner who is disabled roving thru treat ex staff and customers the same VERY BADLY. How is it so difficult for them to admit they mis sold this plan, fur me to keep the handset and them just alter the airtime plan or even reduce the cost down to the advertised one. I have now got to wait at home 2 days for collection. Every time you phone Vodafone you get a different answer from every member of staff. We have been with them for 40 years but no loyalty. They made a mistake and we are the ones being penalised. Dave yourselves the wasted time and effort and buy direct from Apple",0
"Still awaiting final bill and settlement from social media team, promised to be sorted 23 November.  Obviously, they tell you lies, just as their sales team in the shops and their phone operators. Do not have any dealings with this company, I have been messed around by them since July. The reply to this review is to contact thier social media team to sort it, I've tried that only to be fobbed of with "" sorry we will sort it by the 23rd November "", they haven't yet . Do they expect me to keep falling for thier lies and bad service.",0
"So for a week I have had not been able to load up anything on my phone , I finally called and explained , I had a young lady who laughed every time she spoke after 20 minutes I gave up , I was called back a few days later from emmar , I gave my address out yet again and said this wasn’t what they had for me so I gave out my previous address still saying I couldn’t pass security , I gave my date of birth still not enough , was asked for my PIN code said I hadn’t a clue what it was , even asked to guess it ? What was the point of that ? Apart from giving a DNA sample what do y have to do to get an issue sorted . I have been with vodaphone for a good 30 years . What is it coming to ? I have two accounts with you , maybe time for a change ! Never felt so frustrated in my life . Problem was never sorted ! How can you not know if the service is down in certain areas ? I forgot to add I also gave them my email which they were sending messages to me .  How is that not enough personal information???",0
Is it even possible to speak to a human being?????I looked at joining up with Broadband but when I saw the install date I cancelled it as it was over a month away. Spoke to my current provider who tell me vodafone have put the order through anyway. Scummy company with dubious morals.,0
"We have spent 6 days without internet and get the same pathetic excuses.Our modem completely stopped working after a month of signing up and it took them countless days to deliver a new one.When it did arrive, the internet still didn't work.As with many other people on here, I spent a few hours on the phone to their Asian call centre who tried to be helpfuland in reality did nothing.After losing the will to live I asked to cancel and they had the nerve to say that there would be £80++ fees and we had to send this & that back.So, if anything goes wrong don't expect help,expect to be charged more.If you want to be exploited and give your money away then Vodafone is the company for you!",0
"I was a loyal Vodafone customer for two years, even though the signal occasionally dropped during Microsoft Teams meetings at work. I decided to upgrade to a 500MB plan because of an offer, but the signal worsened, dropping out even more during work hours. Frustrated, I cancelled within the 14-day cooling-off period.When I spoke to an advisor, I was told my contract would revert to my original one, set to end on December 12th. However, upon calling Vodafone to cancel as I’m joining EE, I discovered I allegedly owe £225 because, during the downgrade, Vodafone placed me on a new 2-year contract without informing me.I waited 30 minutes to speak to customer service today, requesting they review the recorded phone call where I downgraded. The advisor clearly made a mistake, and now I’m being falsely accused of taking out a new contract and trying to avoid paying for it.Vodafone, your service has been poor. I’ve included my order number so you can review my account notes and see how many times I’ve contacted you about issues. It’s unacceptable to place me in a new contract without explaining terms and conditions. This is a blatant error and breach of consumer law. Please resolve this immediately.",0
"Started the switching process 20th September. Connection ""possibly"" 20th December. The date just keeps moving.Useless.",0
"I've been with Vodafone Broadband for 7 years, and I'm amazed so many people say their customer service is good. It's not.I've moved home and have switched to a different supplier. Vodafone have NOT made it easy for me to cancel my old connection and are still sending me bills every month.I have been out of contract for well over a year and have been on a rolling payment in tht time.I've moved out and no longer need it. How difficult can this be?!Live Chat was terrible (with an AI bot), so I called instead. I explained the problem to the man on the phone, and he hung up.So I sent a letter, along with the return of the equipment, which explained the above and stated that the service should be cancelled.Still they keep sending the bills and still they haven't closed the account.I will never use anything to do with Vodafone again. Terrible experience.The company I'm now with is Airband and so far, so good. The monthly cost is less, the speed is much faster and there are no price hikes for the duration of the contract, which is very different from the yearly price hikes with Vodafone.",0
Had £20 in there waiting for next month suprise disappears day before what a joke no contact number to speak to a human,0
"November 14th, I place an order, receive confirmation, all ok.  November 15th, I call up just to ask some details only for them to tell me my order was cancelled the day before however I had not been told, if I hadn't called I would probably be waiting on installation day only for nobody to show up. Apparently they can't even schedule for a new installation until the previous tenant is out, can't we schedule things in advance this day and age.  They then tell you to wait until the previous tenant moves out before even scheduling the new install and by the way then you need to wait 2 weeks for installation, what, to turn a service on?  So I wait until November 23rd after the previous tenant moves out and has their service with vodafone terminated, make my order, receive an installation date of December 10th, great.  December 3rd, I call, ask if we can't speed things up as the previous tenant also had Vodafone full fibre service and I even have my own equipment, why can't I plug it in and they activate my service.  Nope, not possible, they want to send engineers out to dig up the garden and lay more fibre lines which was just already done for the previous tenant, oh, and at the same time I am told ""things on the back end somehow got turned around and we haven't even scheduled your installation"" so now it's been put back to the 16th.  If I had not called in on the 3rd would I now be waiting around on the 10th only to then be told installation would be around the 24th ie two weeks out.  Not only this but I have had issues with account creation and because so many things went wrong I will also miss out on the £75 voucher during sign up.  What a joke, I have had service installations all around the world and never anything like this, and you get told sorry sorry sorry but the only solution is that your installation gets pushed more and more back.  I just moved into a new place and need internet to buy furniture, set up smart devices etc but sorry, just wait a few more weeks.  My expectations at this point is they will mess up the scheduling again and I'll be lucky to get installed before new year.December 7th Update.The previous agent who placed my new order on December 3rd for installation on the 16th had promised to call me back and update me on the order status, I never heard from them.Here we are on December 7th, I call in, how is the status of my order I ask, ""oh sir, it's ben cancelled"", are you serious, why, who cancelled it and didn't even bother to notify me?New agent, we can place the order again, new installation date earliest available is December 19th...I wish I could give negative stars, this is the most disgusting level of service I have had in my 45 years on this planet from any provider on any continent I have lived.January 2nd 2025 Update.6 weeks after initial contact and countless calls and promises and guess what, still no installation, even promises from so called supervisors / customer support specialists to keep track of your order to make sure it completes and keep you informed, guess what, no order completed and you don't hear from them unless you call them and then you get the usual so sorry but not really sorry garbage.I am out....",0
"3 weeks after joining Vodafone, and service is out. So far, we're on day 4. I spent almost 2 hours on phone and chat service today, to no avail (mostly trying to bypass their request for a 'PIN' (which for some reason I don't have) or their assertion that I was giving them the wrong date of birth, so they could get into my account. Outcome? Nil. Still no service. ""I assure you that our team is working on it"". Is this good service? And they hide behind their long-term contracts, threatening you with penalties if you try to cancel on them. GreatUpdate: look at their reply below. Non-committal, and they offer me the possibility to discuss things with them ""on facebook"" or ""on Instagram"". No offer of a phone number or of an e-mail address. Does everyone have Facebook and Instagram? I certainly don't. Besides, consider how my discussions have gone with them to date; it's basically: you don't have service (for 5 days now)? We're working on it...You can't cancel your service without paying all the unused months in your [2 year] contract.",0
Customer service is useless.First my order was cancelled and they failed to appropriately inform me leading to weeks delay which when you work from home is really impractical.When the order was finally sent they didnt include the adapter needed to connect the hub to the internet port. They advised they send the item out but it was not received. Rang again and they sent a second one out. Still not received. About a week later I got a slip through the post from royal mail asking me to pay a fee for a delivery as it had not been covered by the sender. I paid not know what it was going to be and it turned out to be the missing part. I rang to ask for my money to be refunded and submitted a complaint. 3 weeks later I have heard nothing back. Chased again today and the reference number I was originally given for my previous complaint didn't exist. Have not been offered any compensation or genuine apology.Also when I rang for assistance in setting my broadband up the person on the phone tried to convince me the correct port was located in the hallway cupboard- a location that does not have a power source...Staff clearly read from a script when on a call or on the web chat and it is infuriatingly repetitive.Will be looking to change providers as soon as I can.,0
Really bad experience in my whole life with Vodafone really racist assistance and the manger was racist to he didn’t take any action.Never had a problem in the one in Cribs,0
"The worst provider ever! -- avoid this scam company !! I got a phone on contract for £45 for 24 months.. After 6 months they decided to push to £56 months! -- like a joke!! - so I had to pay this amount for the whole 24 months! .. and then when the contract ended, they decided to charge me extra for a month even though the contract ended.. They give you BS like its advanced payment etc and they will refund you .. now I am wasting my time in getting my refund from them !--- SCAMMMM SCAAMMM SCAMMMM !! just AVOID this company. Go with O2 or EE, even if you have to pay more!",0
What a total a waste of time . Ordered a sim upgrade on Black Friday for £20.40 50gb data plus roaming also gout talked in to an additional new sim with 100g for £10 . All sounds good BUT after checking my app on 2nd Dec I see that the sim upgrade has not been applied to the account . I call Vodafone and speak to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that the order was taken but never completed ! So what can we do I ask and I’m told that the agent is going to speak to his manager . After talking to his manager he is told they can do nothing . So I have asked for the PAK code for that account and I’m going to take my business else where .Then I ask for them to cancel the extra sim that was ordered at the same time as the up grade which they can’t do because that has also not been completed and until they complete I can’t cancel . so now we are in total limbo as to what is happening. The one thing I do know is that after 20+ years with Vodaphone they are a complete waste of time & I’m done with them,0

"I have had a terrible experience with Vodafone UK. Despite paying for the fastest internet package, I constantly face issues with connectivity and speed. To make matters worse, my monthly bill was increased due to mistakes made by one of their branch staff on my account.When the product was sold to me, I was misled about its details. When I tried to cancel my contract after realizing this, they refused, leaving me stuck in a frustrating situation. For months, I have been dealing with ongoing stress and what feels like a kind of trauma caused by their unprofessional service and lack of support.I have repeatedly tried to seek help to resolve my issues, but I’ve found no professional or effective assistance. I’m tired of calling and asking for help, only to get nowhere. I feel completely trapped in my contract and am counting down the days until it ends.I cannot wait to be free from this awful service. I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on my experience.",0
"I have been using a Vodafone SIM card under contract while working at East Croydon Station, and the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts and a SIM swap, the internet connection and network coverage remain non-existent. As a self-employed black cab driver, I rely heavily on mobile apps and internet access for my work, and this issue has severely impacted my ability to operate.For the past four months, I have sent emails to Vodafone's customer service and technical team every month, but have not received any response. Additionally, I have been calling customer service every week, sometimes twice a week, but they have not been able to fix the problem.When I requested to end the contract, which runs until June 2025, Vodafone insisted on a cancellation fee of £180. This is unacceptable considering the consistent lack of service. If you're considering signing a contract with Vodafone, think very carefully. In my experience, the service has been unreliable, and the support unhelpful.Save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable options.",0
Possibly the biggest wast of time I’ve spent in my 72 years with multiple phone calls to and from Vodafone. Placed an order for fast fibre in July 24 and cancelled it today as I’m completely fed up with waiting for engineers to turn up and apologetic calls excusing the reason why they didn’t.ABSOLUTE DISGRACEAVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!It really doesn’t help that the call centres are mainly abroad and I can’t understand a word!!!,0
"Useless, on the phone for an hour because they couldn't sign me into my own account. The pinnacle of ineptitude",0
"Switched to Vodafone as they were offering 4x faster broadband than my previous provider for less than £2 more per month. They sent out a router ahead of the installation date, which I requested to be diverted to my local post office so I could collect when I'm not at work. I got an email to say it had been delivered on Monday, so I went to the post office, only to find that it hadn't actually been delivered, and my parcel was on its way back to Vodafone. When I contacted Vodafone on Tuesday, they said they would try and get a replacement to me by the end of the week. Openreach installed the line on Thursday, it's now the following Monday and I'm still without a router.",0

"We opted for Full Fibre on 01.11.2024 and needed a full installation as previous copper line had been disconnected prior to our house purchase. After carefully reading up on Vodafone's installation process they said a prearranged date for installation would be agreed and a home owner would need to be present to discuss where the box would be installed. Meanwhile, in between our organised date we noticed a box had been installed on our house right near our front door. From that moment everything went from bad to worse. To cut a very long story short, countless contact with Vodafone's customer services who are either robots or cant speak a word of English we are still no where near being connected let alone getting the box moved on 02.12.2024. The second (first prearranged) visit from the engineer explained that Openreach subcontract the works to two different companies for internal and external installations, they don't even employ their own engineers. If you want to lose countless hours of your precious time, loss of earnings, feel totally frustrated and exasperated by all means go ahead with Vodafone. I would happily have cancelled my contract but I'm too exhausted by it all.",0

Regarding: Samsung Z fold 5I did not have a good experience with customer service because I was told I would get charged to speak to the technical team.So if I booked an appointment with the technical team I would be charged which I have no ideawhy !!The other solution was I send the phone off for repair without me knowing what the situation is with the phone how can I just send it off for repair!!! I requested appointment in store with customer service because you would be waiting for a long time just to be seen and I was told that I would have to walk in and wait and wait until I am seen.they would not assist over the phone because the handset is not in front of them I simply had a storage issue & phone turning off whist using the device.I was looking for something simple answers because I thought it might just be something that can be sorted out in person rather than me having to send this handset off which is so frustrating. Waste of call & cannot hear the person talking as they use bad headsets which makes the voice muffled. Regret being with Vodaphone!,0
Very poor service. I have recently moved to a area that the service checker said has good indoor and outdoor service. When moving into the property I have had no signal inside or out. I have called vodaphone and they have said that they are very sorry but they cannot help me. Seeing as I upgraded in may and am now in a contract till may 2026 and the address that I took the contract out in had great service. I have asked for discount and they have said that I am not eligible seeing as I am in contract. The lady I spoke to said that there is nothing that she can do to help me and it's not a technical problem with anything they just don't have a great service for my postcode hu129qh. Despite the service checker saying otherwise. They do not offer a signal booster.Be careful taking out a contract with this network.,0
"I got a new Apple Watch and Vodafone made it really easy to turn on the extra services for it, which I then decided I didn't want to use so turned it off within a week or so. Two months later they were still billing me for it, and turns out while you can sign up with just a tap in the app, turning it off doesn't actually stop the billing. You have to call them and sit and wait on a line for 20 minutes to request the billing to stop even if you turn it off in the app. That's not OK.",0
"Poor connection - wifi drops daily for years. Customer service is really poor. Their solution to wifi drops, instead of trying to fix it, is to convince you to pay more for upgrading your contract and locking yourself into a longer term with them where they won’t help if you ever experience issues.I’ve had a contract with them for years, and they increase the price year on year but will never discount the price or offer a new contract at a better rate (despite connection issues). Currently I’m paying far more than new customers, so I will be switching and I would not recommend the service to anyone else.",0
"In January this year I had FTTP installed with Vodafone at great stress and inconvenience due to poor installation.This week I decided I wanted to take advantage of the benefits of increased speeds available on FTTP, so I made an order to upgrade from 73mbps to 500mbps.It was due to go live tomorrow 2nd December, but today I got a call from a vodafone call centre employee to say my order has to be cancelled because ""my FTTP connection is not capable of 500mbps"" !!!!!!!!!!!!The whole purpose of FTTP is to enable the connection to go that fast!!!!!!!!So I went through immeasurable amounts of stress and inconvenience with the original swap from copper to FTTP and it was a complete waste of time! RIDICULOUS!I wish I had never moved to Vodafone and will be leaving as soon as I am able to, never to return.An awful experience with a shockingly bad company.",0
Ordered an additional handset to be collected from the store due to having my own business and long working hours. Visited the store up to now 3 times to collect and due to the systems been down at the hull St stephens store the manager could not release it. Not only could she not release it but you only have 7 days to collect it and she couldn't extend that time as after 7 days of them having it they automatically send it back regardless of this issue been their issue. They would not allow me to be identified via calling Vodafone and doing it over the phone. The managers attitude was just cancel it if you don't want it. ! I do want it! She repeatedly said that and repeatedly said how she was annoyed with the systems not working but showed no empathy or sympathy for the 30 miles round trip I was making each time. On top if this she could nit offer a home delivery in any way . Also when visiting the next day there was still no computers working and the younger man in charge was even worse with attitude and costumer service. There was either no will to even try and no problem solving skills within the team even when I said why don't they take my I'd scan it now and then send out to me she waved her hands about and said no. The guy today said its against the law! Which it isn't. He said he would be fired but his attitude was just worse in his facial expressions. He didn't want to deal with anything and when I said well can I have a phone call to say your up and running again as the next time I come will be 4 times of 30 mile round trips..he stated look I don't know how many miles you do and I will take your number but can't guarantee anyone is going to call you! When I asked why that was..he said because it's not up to me to get someone else and I cannot make someone else do it if I'm not here. The systems and processes are ridiculous and Vodafone do not care about customer experience. Big company low quality service!,0

"I want to share my recent experience with your customer service team when I called 08080034515.The first time I called, a woman answered and asked me to hold while she checked some information, but the call got disconnected. I waited for her to call back, but she didn’t.I called again, and this time a man picked up. Me as a non-native English speaker, I found his speech very fast and unclear. To make things worse, there was a lot of background noise—people laughing and chatting—which didn’t sound professional at all. When I couldn’t understand what he said, I asked him to repeat it, but he still spoke quickly. then I asked if he could slow down, and he sighed loudly, which felt very rude. whats your problem?I told him that if he didn’t want to help me, he could ask another colleague to take over. Instead, he left me on the line without saying anything, and I could still hear the noisy background. When I tried asking if he was there, he didn’t respond. After a while, I was suddenly put on hold with music playing.I had my recording with this!  do you want to hear how you treat your customers like that? This is truly the first time I have encountered such service even in other countries or other customer services,  with absolutely no basic respect at all.Is this how your company treats customers? I’ve always had a good impression of Vodafone—the staff in stores and the online chat team have been polite and helpful—but this was a terrible experience. I can’t imagine how an elderly customer or someone else who isn’t fluent in English would feel in this situation. It’s not unreasonable to ask someone to speak more clearly or repeat themselves when the background is noisy.Thankfully, my third call was a completely different experience. A different woman answered, and she was so patient and polite. She spoke clearly, and there was no background noise at all. She listened carefully and helped me solve my problem. I really appreciate her professionalism and effort. If every customer service agent were like her, this company would be so much better.I hope you take this feedback seriously. Bad service like the second call can drive loyal customers away, but good service like the third call makes people want to stay.Thank you.",0

"Shocking experience when ordering new broadband.  Despite having an order in place and confirmed install date, Vodafone did not turn up on the day and had no record of the order despite sending me a contract and taking payment details.

"RIP OFF SCAM!I am OUT OF Contract with them. I have NO commitment to them OR TO THEIR COMPANY POLICY. So....I called and instructed them to cease their service to me as I am moving to Florida. I was told the WILL continue for 30 days after and on from my instruction to stop.I explained in clear tones that they CANNOT FORCE me to take their service. Their operator said that it is company policy. I made it clear that I am not subject to their company policy and should they continue to provide a service having been instructed to cease, I will not pay them especially as I will have moved to Florida. FORCING PEOPLE TO USE THEIR SERVICES.. DISGUSTING!!See their dimwitted reply. Still insisting they can FORCE their service on us. Their policies are for them and I an not one of them.... Clearly I am NOT subject to your policies. You make it clear that because other suppliers (doubtless with their own policies designed to meet with their own requirements and not designed as a cover for Vodafone to use to slither behind while attempting to rip off ex-customers) do it therfore it is OK for you to do It. That's like a child saying ""well all the other kids do it so that makes it OK for me to do it""People are NOT subject to your policies and once out of contract with you people are actually not subject to your contract either. I do hope people are reading this and taking note of your attempts at FORCING me to use your service after you were told that you are no longer required so cease and desist.I felt sorry for your agent who had to tell me her manager couldn't speak to me because he had gone out. When I responded by saying I didn't believe that old canard and more likely her manager told her that she is an agent getting paid to deal with calls, so deal with it by herself. She didn't deny it.So....you think it is good customer service for your managers to not come and help your customer who is clearly not satisfied with your agent's help?You think it creates a good impression that your managers are out rather than doing the job of supporting their agents and indeed customers?Why didn't the assistant manager come to help?Supervisor maybe? Hmm?RIP OFF!!NB... We are not on first name terms. The correct form of address is ""sir"".",0
"I ordered Vodafone in hope that they will provide good service, however their service is as awful as it can get. They could not install me on the date provided. They did the internals but not the externals. While doing the internals their engineer drilled through my gas and water line. I tried complaining it to Vodafone but the answer I got that it was Openreach engineer and I have to claim compensation with Openreach. Vodafone cannot provide me any solution. I tried explaining to the agent that I have not ordered from openreach. My service provider is Vodafone and Vodafone should look into the it but they provided no solution as Openreach is their installation contractor. I sat in my house in this cold without water or heating till late night. When I insisted the agent on call told me he has registered my complaint and someone from Vodafone will contact me but no one contacted from Vodafone. After a week someone turned up and replaced the damaged pipe. No clue when someone will come to fix the broadband and do the external work. Everyday I get a text message saying someone will call me within an hour but no one ever did.  The service is appalling—avoid Vodafone if you value your peace of mind. It's truly disgraceful.",0
"Everything they could get wrong they did. New customer cancelled my order without notification. Left me without internet. Set up a new contract not at the agreed deal but max pricing. Terminated my contract again on agreement asked me to switch to another supplier. I switched to Sky, Vodaphone cancelled the transfer, I am not seen as an existing customer for Sky and can't get a new customer deal. Third supplier now to get onto the internet. I cancelled with the 14 days, they want to charge me Termination fees. Communication is awfull, the chat box is useless, to get to a human takes ages, you get to different departments, I have had sales, engineering, termination, accounts. My life has been waisted for the last three weeks trying to have conversations with them to sort there problems out.I am sure if it goes through normally you will be ok but if you have any problems god forbid your time and engery will be sucked out of you.",0
"What an absolutely shocking company to deal with. Ordered broadband router arrived very quickly. At 00.17 on the day of the engineer appointment received an unintelligible voicemail. Then took all that morning talking to robots to eventually learn that the “backend team” whatever that is, had cancelled the order. Left with no connection whatsoever as bt connection cancelled at midnight. I was going to have this installed at my own home but after the fiasco at my employers house not a chance. It’s beyond shocking and polite language will not let me express how I really feel. AVOID.",0
"Been stuck with 6mbps download for over a year, asked repeatedly what's going on, why is it so slow, but I was always brushed off saying it's within expected range or something. just switched to a different provider and they told me on day 1 of installation that the line is damaged outside and that inside the house the signal is being split to multiple sockets and that's splitting the speed, in one day they found two seperate fults and im now on 15mbps download instead of 6 and waiting for the line to be replaced in a few weeks. And if that wasn't enough I told Vodafone I wanted to cancel in October not now Ive had to pay £22 for an additional month because whoever I spoke to couldn't be bothered actually doing her job and canceling my contract, now I've been told I have to pay £22 so in 22 days my final bill will be ready and they will refund the £22 i just payed ?? What a stupid system. The chat bot is utter rubbish disconyme after the ordeal of trying to sort all this out for over an hour and a half !! Will never use Vodafone again. TOTAL RUBBISH!!!!!!",0
"Not honest service, disrespectful to elderly.They make business contracts for the elderly without asking their opinion against their wish. Those people never had a business when they used to work and currently, they are pensioners. The people pay a very high price mostly using for calls and texts.They take payments from direct debits twice a month instead of once a month.I have had a humiliating experience with Ipswich Vodaphone.I have used their service for two months but they charged me three times.I left them in March before April  I didn't want to pay an expensive price for hardly using their dater.With my family, we use only WhatsApp calls and messages.Without shame, they applied to TredUnion as I didn't pay for 4-5 months.Their dishonesty and greed make me feel sick.I am not the only person who is disappointed, I know other people as well.",0
"Vodafone is the worst network provider. It transmits a very low-quality signal to my house. I need to move rooms to locate a signal to make a call. When I contacted, they informed me that I had a poor connection in my home area and advised me to enable home wifi for phone calls. When I indicate I want to cancel, their early termination cost exceeds the whole value of the remainder of my contract. Totally untrustworthy business. The most costly source, the lowest quality, and they never take responsibility for cancellation. I am paying more money to obtain better service than the other providers, but I am receiving really poor service while paying more. Not fair. I will never use Vodafone and never recommend it to my friends. And will inform anybody about their unjust corporate policy. I can't believe their answer is to make calls using my home wifi as a provider.",0
"I’ve been a loyal Vodafone customer for over 20 years and have always valued their excellent service – with one major exception: the network coverage around Oxford, Abingdon, and Witney is extremely poor. It’s never been great, but over the past couple of years, it has become significantly worse.I’ve contacted Vodafone numerous times to resolve this issue. At first, I was told the weak signal was due to maintenance work. Once that was completed, there was no improvement. I then reset my phone settings as advised, but the problem persisted. Finally, I was told that if I was unhappy, I could terminate my contract without penalty.This isn’t just my issue; I know other Vodafone users in the area who face the same challenges. It’s frustrating to be unable to make calls or constantly get disconnected.Hoping to escalate the matter, I emailed the CEO, Max Taylor, as I felt he should be made aware that customers are being told their only solution is to leave Vodafone. Unfortunately, my email never reached him as all communications are intercepted and dealt with by a team of senior customer service officers  – I was informed that he only sees summaries of complaints, and there are no plans to improve coverage in this area.Vodafone’s response to long-standing customers like me is disappointing. Customers deserve better than being advised to switch providers instead of having their concerns addressed. Surely this is not a good business model.I hope Vodafone’s leadership reconsiders both their approach to network improvements and their customer complaints process and that those at the top of the organisation are not protected by an impenetrable layer in the tiers below.Reply to Vodafone response to my post:My point was that it is impossible to get through the customer service barrier to the CEO and there is no plan to improve network coverage - NOT just in my immediate local area. I see no point in going on Facebook or Twitter. I don’t need a conversation, just action.",0
I moved from payg to pay monthly 13th of November. I’m still waiting to move to pay monthly? I keep getting people on the chat or over the phone who don’t know how everything works? I’m going to a Vodafone store tomorrow to try and get some sort of confirmation of what I need to do to get a temporary number so I can move to pay monthly? Veryo frustrating when people on Vodafone don’t want to help you.,0
"Just a terrible company! Rejecting an application for not meeting the ""criteria"" yet refusing to state the criteria required. I have a stable job, great credit score, good income. It seems like what you are actually saying is ""Oops, you found a deal which is too good value, our mistake. We can't allow you to have it, let's reject your application and mess up your credit score"". Joke of a company. I will be going to the Ombudsman as this is ridiculous to reject someone and not tell them despite their credit score and credit limit being extremely good, never missed a single payment in my life, always pay in full. Just ridiculous.",0
"Mobiles.co Were greatUnfortunately the Vodafone airtime contract wasn't.Vodafone refused to let me carry my old 2 year Vodafone contract number, this despite the old two year contract ending.They said that as I had got my Phone and contract from a third party and not.Vodafone directly they refused to allow me to keep my Number.When I rung Vodafone they said that had I bought the phone from them there would have been no issue and the number would have been ported in a couple of days, seems like Bullying to me.However and of course the same phone from Vodafone was 8 pound a month more expensive disgusting treatment from Vodafone.Needless to say I cancelled both contracts on the spot.Mobiles .co were Brilliant, Vodafone are tripe..",0
"They failed to notify my broadband provider when they took over the line,  which meant I was charged for both.  They tried to tell me it was my fault,  and just made stuff up. Over 3 hours on the phone, transferred 6 times and it's still not sorted.  An absolute shambles of a company.Update:Text exchanges with 10 different people who all failed to acknowledge what the web site says is not what happened. I asked the same question eight times and they ignored it every time.",0
Service and staff are terrible. when i called customer service to transfer broadband to a new address spoke to a horrible staff. he had a very bad accent and spoke very fast which made it hard to understand. i asked him to speak louder slower or speak more clearly and he got angry and then he started doing tricks that wasted my time on the phone which cost me a lot of money for the call (about 1 hour and 45 minutes call). he kept asking me a question and put me on hold for a few minutes like that I don't remember how many times he put me on hold. i asked him to stop this antics but he continued. he was trying to make things difficult for me. i asked to speak to the manager but he wouldn't connect me to the manager and told me to wait for the manager to call back. i waited but no call back. would not recommend anyone to Vodafone and will never go to vodafone again.,0
"Always been with BT who are very reliable but too expensive so wanted to give Vodafone a go and i regret my decision. 24h from the activation day the router just died completely so was left without broadband for more than 3 days and had to drive to work from the office. When the new router arrived, the speeds have been fluctuating so much. At times instead of the contract 150Mbs i got around 1Mbs in the evening and and now while working in the morning between 3 and 45Mbs of download speed. Thankfully i’m still in a 14 day cooling off period to switch to Sky. What’s worse is i’m in Newbury where the Vodafone headquarters are and i get even worse service! It is also not very clear what number to call when there are issues and you need to use their awful chat service which slows things down.",0

"I tried to renew by broadband / landline , to a better deal after vodaphone had hiked up the charges after years of being a customer and my circumstances had changed after my wife’s accident she had become totally disabled, at first 3rd October a representative of the company said they can offer a better deal and we would be put on it with a 24month contract, several months latter I found this had just not happened , I called again they said I should have been put on it and they have a record of it and they will put me on the new deal now ( perhaps a Indian call Center where I feel sorry for the staff who had limited English language skills more staff training is required)  , but I will loose out financially from October the 3rd until now . I’ve just found out this had still not been resolved, I’m still paying the high rate , This is basically fraud on vodaphone part , I’d recommend anyone reading this to avoid vodaphone as there customer service is none existent, there’s no complaints E mail mail !! And the only customer service I’m getting now is a useless chat Bot . The only way to complain is post !!! So please Guys if you are reading this and you are thinking of switching to vodaphone as a broadband provider think again , it’s not worth the hassle, !I’m going to have another few hours of my time wasted by them today , but ultimately the I suspect the final solution is to change providers.One very disappointed customer,James Thompson",0
"Rotten to the core,  this company just keeps on lying and feeding you misinformation, starting with the salesman in the great yarmouth shop, assuring me I could cancel anytime before next payment due several times,it turns out a lie there's a 30day cancellation period, next lie chap on phone when canceling contract.told me I'd be charged £18 but they'd probably take the £37 monthly charge a refund the difference .they took the £37 not seen the refund. Also he didn't cancel the  contract  next lie a woman on the phone a month later assured me the contract was cancelled, another lie. The next lie was from  the social media team who told me it's sorted and the are waiting for the final bill on the 23rd November and would reach out to me on the 24th to check all is correct, as its now the 29th November I can only assume that's another lie . This has been going on for  4 months now, they have even had debt collectors chasing me for non existing debts, they  admit I don't owe anything but their attitude is opps sorry. Don't have any dealings with company, don't believe any of the good reviews posted by the staff. They are all lies.",0

"Yet again, their broadband goes down and they do nothing to help.The amount of time there is a service outage with their broadband is ridiculous, and they provide no compensation. Only after two full days they will even think of providing you with compensation. But for most of us who rely on Internet to work from home, waiting two days for connectivity to be fixed and then be compensated for it is absolutely ridiculous.As soon as my contract finishes, i am moving to another provider. They are the most unreliable broadband provider i have ever had.I encourage you to go with another provider",0

"Got locked into a 2 years contract with promises that turns out to be all lies. Every month Vodafone will add charges and don’t even know where those charges are coming from. Signal is the worse compared to all the other networks I’ve been on. For example, if I’m on a call I won’t be able to use other apps that require internet access. Rang Vodafone to express my dissatisfaction and all they said if cancel then I’ll have to pay for the rest of the contract. Currently seeking legal advice.Another instance is when I travel to America. Got a t-mobile SIM card but Vodafone still managed to add extra charges. Rang Vodafone again and it’s the same old story. Again I have no idea where those charges came from.  0% recommended.",0

"Vodafone took all my data, cancelled my current provider, carried out a credit check and quite unjustifiably refused my application. My credit ratings vary from 578 to 979 from Equifax to Experian. The difference? I don't use a credit card or apply for credit. I appealed against Vodafone's decision providing financial details and background but was turned down again. First time in 86 years!! Or maybe it's my age!Vodafone Social Media responded to my comment, see below. Firstly. they cannot have known how I felt failing a credit check for the first time in my life at 86 years of age. Secondly, whoever wrote this ignored that I had already filed an ""appeal"" and been again rebuffed. What should I expect from another appeal - further indignity? If this is Vodafone's attitude I am happy that I was saved from any further exposure to their arrogance. I now know why Vodafone get so many negative comments for their customer service! I don't need them.",0
I ordered full fibre to the premises on 6th November. My install date was yesterday 27th November. Having had my old copper calling removed and all the necessary fibre installed. I was told that the Openreach connection on the pole outside hadn't been activated . Having spoken to Vodafone they are telling me the earliest Openreach can look at this is the 5th December. I now have no phone line or broadband. Despite informing Vodafone I have a daughter who has a disability and it is essential I am able to contact her. They said there is nothing they can do. My mobile phone does not work from my home 90 % of the time. So I don't  really know what to do. I did ask Vodafone if they could supply a dongle but they said no. Given I was bombarded with text messages regarding the installation I would have thought Vodafone would have checked there was a viable connection in place.Order number: WEB-0001000041337817Messaged Vodafone as requested.Nothing they can do.,0
"Was with Vodafone for over 10 years. 8 years ago they messed up 2 direct debits which went down as missed payments on my credit file, I didn't complain, just one of those things. Upgraded many times, sometimes with phones, sometimes SIM only. Never needed to call them, never thought to complain when I had grounds to, never missed a payment by my own doing. My new quote for SIM only (because they didn't have the phones I wanted) was £4 more a month than my old SIM and for fewer Gb data each month. Found a black Friday deal for the phone I wanted with ID Mobile. But because my current contract didn't end until 9/12/24, a little over a week from today, I was getting an early termination charge. I brought all this up and mentioned how unfair I thought it was, but that went unheard.Update. Yesterday's reply was a waste of time. I followed their link only to be told the couldn't do anything. An absolute waste of time and energy. They couldn't look in to anything as they explained they would. A very frustrating interaction with them.",0
"After some time trying to upgrade with Vodafone’s female call handler I managed to potentially upgrade two of my phones however I was not told how to check each phones suitability for trade in,I was due a call back at 1800pm yesterday to confirm the deal which never happened and finally when I called back there was no details of my call so I would have to start again….very frustrating day which resulted in me getting a better deal using the app.",0
With writing a really good review last month about my upgrade in store I have woken up today with £90 taken out my account and I have no idea why.

"Having decided to move to Vodafone broadband to save money and to improve speed, the whole process turned into a complete debacle.  Once I had signed up I was inundated with emails and texts, initially from Vodafone, and then from British Telecom.  In the main these texts kept confirming the date and time when a BT engineer would call at my house to install the fibre connection.  This was an afternoon in November (between 1pm and 6pm).  I kept being reminded that, if I failed to keep the appointment, I could be penalised.  I made a special trip to my house (as I was staying with a friend on that day) and arrived in good time on the date scheduled.  And I waited, and I waited,  At 16:16 I received a text from BT to say my engineer, Daniel, was on site.  Well, he patently wasn't but I presumed the message might mean he was at the local junction box, a mile away.  6pm came and went and still no sign of Daniel at my house, and no more text updates.  I tried sending messages to that text number with no success.  So, then I rang Vodafone who would not talk to me because I could not recall my security pin number, which I had recorded on my laptop that I did not have with me.  At 9pm I returned to my friend's.  For communication companies, Vodafone and BT are completely without a clue when it comes to keeping their customer updated.  BT rang me the following morning, and the reason Daniel had not turned up at my house to do the job he was supposed to do was... it had got dark!  What?  Dark?  In mid-November at gone 4pm?  What a surprise.  I cancelled my contract with Vodafone and then received another text to say the company had credited my account with £12 and a few pence to compensate me because my broadband had not gone live when it should.  Clueless, hopeless customer service and no email to send my complaint to - just a useless chatbot, TOBi, a postal address, and customer service agents unable to help me on the night I was awaiting the engineer because my security code was elsewhere.",0
"I'm gonna write here cause it looks like they actually respond and maybe we can get this solved. My husband took out a phone contract, it's been three weeks and the mobile data still doens't work. He's spent countless hours on the phone to vodafone customer service and they just send him through loops, now literally nothing works, we were told we have to go into a store today because they can't even find him anymore the contract just doesn't exist (but they're still trying to take out the £48 as we speak) and we need to go in store, in store are like yeah thanks for coming give them a call nothing we can do. We call them again, they literally just aren't doing anything I've actually never seen anything like it. It's completely insane. Our broadbands on vodafone and he's been on vodafone for literal years I don't get it lolUpdate: I reached out to instagram as recommended by the below response, they just keep asking me for my name and details and saying sorry and nothing ever gets fixed. To clarify, we've been paying for a contract that does not work.",0
Worst customer service ever!! Rang them up to say I will not be renewing my contract or upgrading with them and to finish my contract! Received text messages after saying we're sorry to see you go and so on.. but now I have rang them up again to find out they have said there is no cancellation request! So I will be getting billed again the next month. Bloody useless fools just send you round in circles and can't do their jobs properly!,0
"Trying to interact with customer service is incredibly challenging. I've been trying to leave since April, but have been getting charged monthly since then. Interactions with the chat bot are excruciating, and once I'm through to a human they just pass me around between teams, no one seems to know what's going on or remembers anything. All I've been trying to do for months is get a refund. Incredibly poor experience.",0

"I was deeply disappointed with Vodafone's handling of my broadband move. At my old address, I enjoyed 900 Mbps speeds, but at my new address, the maximum speed they could offer was only 80 Mbps—a drastic downgrade. Despite this, they refused to waive the early termination fee, even though they failed to provide a comparable service. It’s incredibly frustrating that Vodafone penalizes customers for moving to areas they cannot properly service. Their lack of flexibility and unwillingness to support loyal customers is unacceptable.",0
Getting lied to by one of the workers to start with so now I am stuck in a two year contract with a useless provider I don't want to be with. I was charged over 304 pound because there staff cannot do there job properly.The phone they have provided I have had nothing but issues with. I hardly get any signal with this phone and they promised to do something about it but never did. They have an excuse for everything. All I wanted was the money I am owed because they have overcharged me but no I have to settle for a credit on an account I want to leave.Being brutally honest it is a piss poor company with even worse customers service.,0
"Locked in an unwanted contractHad a plan with VOXI, which was terminated only 48 hours after my payment bounced back due to a credit card being stolen and replaced. Only 48 hours after this, my plan was cancelled against my will, and I wasn’t given the chance to reactivate it. I was told I would need to create an entirely new contract, now with Vodafone. I specifically told the agent online that I didn’t want to have a fixed contract and didn’t want to leave VOXI, simply wanted to pay for the missing payment, but I was told that this option was not available. I asked about the benefits of the new plan and it looked like a similar plan with more benefits for the same price. Until it wasn’t. Despite mentioning more than once that I didn’t want to be locked in a contract, my request not respected. A month into my contract and Vodafone has proven to be worse in every way. Higher and more frequent charges. My plan is supposedly larger, and yet I unexplainably run out of MG much faster. Conveniently, the company charges an outrageous amount to add more MB.Today I got in touch with them, to find out that I am locked into a 24-month contract against my will. Despite stating I didn’t want a fixed plan, the agent who assisted me went ahead and selected that plan. I was told that I will need to pay a cancelation fee that costs over £200 if I want to cancel my plan. I will continue to inform people online about this and file a complaint with citizens advice, so they can look into the messages exchanged between myself and the agent. In the meantime, I am living a true nightmare. Beware!!",0

They send me the bill that don't have VAT number on it and at the bottom of it it states - This is not VAT invoice. I don't think is legal to charge VAT and not issue an invoice for it?

When I joined Vodafone there was an offer for a tablet which I did not receive. When I call I was told they will send me a link in November last year and I can use  to collect from amazon. Up till now no link no tablet. The worst part of joining Vodafone is I have Vodafone Wires which was put there by them hanging in front of my house and when I called them today the customer service agent told me to look for a local engineer and pay them to do it. So I still have Vodafone wires hanging in front of my house. Internet Sometimes not great at night.I have started looking for a new provider to leave Vodafone after my call to them today.,0

"I switched to Vodafone broadband from another provider. They advertised that they offer up to £100 credit to cover early contract termination fees.Firstly, the offer is deceptively worded. It is not up to £100. Later I found it was only up to £25. Then they expect me to fill in a form to claim the £25. I did this and it was rejected. I sent them the bill from my previous provider, but it wasn't enough for them. And I sent them my bank statement showing the leaving fee I had to pay. Still not enough. They have me running around in circles trying to claim £25 that I'm entitled to.",0
Customer service is non existent and the staff are the most unhelpful I have ever come across.  Spoke to one advisor you assured me he would call back but unfortunately never did and also did not put any notes on account regarding discussions.  Phoned Vodafone again and I had to go through the whole process again.  Tried to make a complaint unfortunately was unable to.   Vodafone make it very difficult to upgrade!!!!,0
I am not happy with the service nearly 72 hours I have been waiting for my WiFi to connect clearly lies when I was told up to 24 hours not 72 hours not happy with the service,0
"To anyone considering a switch to Vodafone, I urge you…DONT! I recently switched to Vodafone after 8 years with EE for a better deal - a week later and I’m switching back. Terrible mobile data connection, dreadful service, the only saving grace about Vodafone is their customer service. I’ve never left an online review for anything before, but I felt I had to share my poor experience with Vodafone to put anyone else off making the same mistake I did.DO NOT JOIN VODAFONE THEY’RE POOR!!",0
Still waiting for a call that I was promised 2 weeks ago,0
Ensure you cancel your contract after your contract has expired. Had to pay 2 months extra after my so called contract expired. Complete joke!,0
"Scandalous customer service.Every time I call their customer service, you can guarantee I’ll be on the call for at least an hour !!!Very very poor service being passed from operator to operator and STILL not getting my issue dealt with.Issue was cancelling my contract.  Gave 30 days notice and STILL had to pay another 2 months worth of service.Was told to call back and claim refund.No chance. Have got more to do with my time than hanging on the phone for an eternity.Will NEVER use Vodafone again.",0
Bad experienceI Lost 1 hourtime for nothingNot recommendBad idea to go A Brixton  branch,0
"I was compelled to purchase their tracker service for insurance purposes.Firstly, it's rubbish. So many false alarms. Secondly, they are impossible to contact.Finally, with 6 months remaining when I sold my car, no refunds for the remainder - not an inconsiderable sum!",0
Having moved over from Virgin Media the initial move for the broadband went well. But the phone line took a couple of days as expected But the new digital phone line will only let you answer calls from mobiles or other digital lines. Anyone using an old analogue line get number unavailable tone. Customer services have been called every day and after 10 days it is still not working. Awful product and service.,0
"I have an ongoing complaint with Vodafone that I still have not got resolved. Every person I speak to says that they are going to follow up and get this resolved for me but they never doComplaint reference 573844All I want to do is upgrade my wife's handset. That's it!In store can't do itOver the phone can't do itCan't do it onlineCan't do it in appIts taken well over 2 weeks and I'm loosing all patience now!!I have spoke to 4 different complaints handlers and each person promises me the world and never follow through with what they say they are going toFirst person didn't call me back and I was passed on to someone else. The notes they had on the system were a joke and had to explain the full situation again!Exactly the same thing happened a 2nd and 3rd time. Notes are horrific and takes me forever to explain the issue. All I want to do is upgrade my handset!There is an issue with my account and I understand things to wrong, I am a patient guy however this is beyond a jokeThe main thing frustrating me is the false promises. Advisors tell me they are going to do something and they never do! It's downright rude!! And quite frankly I'm sick of itLast advisor told me they expect this to be resolved by the weekend and they would call me back if it wasn't.It's now 1.52pm on Monday afternoon which to me is after the weekend!I have written an email to CEO max Taylor. I am hoping the email reaches him because I have had enoughIf a manager can see this and do something about it I suggest they do. I am giving it till the end of the week before I contact the ombudsman!The service is a joke",0
VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!Their reception in London is awful and their customer service and web applications continually have issues. I suggest you chose any other provider as Vodafone are next to useless!!!,0
The most consumer unfriendly service.Just to be able to log in to my account I needed to contact customer service 5 times. Each time it took awful amount of time.Why is it so difficult for vodafone to do something that is automated by other providers?! Dreadful.,0
Went into the Blackburn Vodaphone shop in the Mall  was put off straight away not one employee made eye contact or welcomed you into store very rude. There was no clear area people were queuing when I asked for help I was looked at like an alien zero customer service. I had been told to go into the store by Vodaphone online to collect sim cards for two contracts which we had not received in the official order. The whole thing was a shambles and the way in which we where dealt with was rude and unhelpful. Due to this we have now cancelled both contracts and would not use Vodaphone again. Good luck to any using this store unless they get further training in how to deal with customers & make customers feel welcome your best ging else where. There was a elderly gentleman in their on his own I felt sorry for him I could see he wasn't getting anywhere and they didn't want to go the extra mile to help him. The staff member looked as confused as he did I it was like no one knew what they were doing. I was told I would have to call Vodaphone to order the sims to be posted to our home address yet I was in the Blackburn Vodaphone shop. They told me its separate!! Mind blowing.,0
VODAFONE has gotta be the most useless 😤 phone company in Britain even worser than KCON! I wanted Broadband OPENREACH said my number couldn't be ported to VODAFONE! VODAFONE then got a CROMER 012635 number and tried to put that on HOLT EXCHANGE it didn't work and I got nothing as I've CEASED my mobile with them and I've now got everything with BT EE and I've saved myself a fortune! Don't waste your time with VODAFONE they are a PARASITE LIKE KCON so call BT and do as I did I've dumped VODAFONE and ill never use their 💩 service again!,0
"Wish there was a zero stars option! I’ve been waiting for over3 months for a full refund of £189.08! Despite making 3 phone calls, and being told 3 times that the money would be refunded to my bank account in approx 7-10 days, over 3  months later and still nothing! Talk about “Easy Switch” this has been absolutely nothing short of an absolute nightmare, do not use these cowboys for your home broadband, they over promise and under deliver. If you wait in all day for connection, trust me, they will not turn up, nor will they let you know that they’re not turning up! Then they will arrange with you a different date to come connect you, you will wait in all day for them to turn up, and guess what! You will get another no show! Disgusting behaviour!",0
Have been with them over 2yrs now. Whilst in contract I had no problems.  After contract ended  we have had so many problems with connection keeps dropping out. Every time we check connection they report there are no problems.Time to leave i think.,0
"Ok, you get an email too login in to see the progress of your order. You need a phone number or account number, which you get when the account is live. The best bit is they are aware of this and have done nothing to rectify it.  You need either number above to talk on the phone or to a person via the chatbot.  The reason I was trying to talk  to someone is the router has been posted to the billing address, not the installation address.  WOW.As always reply obviously only read last sentance of my complaint",0
"Very disappointed with Vodaphone upgrade experience, due to collect my new phone, told unable to due to processing error on Vodaphone side. Very unhelpful, Raised complaint with Customer Services told to call store. No one answering the phone. Would not recommend.",0
"It seems that the three months free apple tv depends on whether you have used apple tv before. I received an apple tv dongle through the post and was told I would be provided an email link. After two online chats and a telephone call, I was finally sent a 'unique' link, which wasn't unique at all. It simply told me how to set up apple tv on the apple tv box. Apple do have promotions for new users to get 3 months free, but as soon as I set it up with my apple ID, I was immediately charged the monthly rate. Its frustrating. The broadband is OK at a reasonable price but this sort of thing leaves a sour taste. I appear to have wasted my time with the phone call and the online chats, and want others to know that some of these sweetener freebees are not necessarily what they seem.",0
Very poor I nearly had there broadband but lack of communication and support made me cancel glad I did I'll look elsewhere.,0
Rubbish company. Overcharged me,0
"If i could give 0 stars i would.They blatantly lied to me regarding the package i was signing up for claiming that i would be on a fibre package and despite there being fibre lines in my area they have me on the old copper lines. Furthermore despite ""guaranteeing"" me speeds of 20mb i get 2mbs-3.5mbs at most which i reported on the first bill payment and asked to have it logged for the record. Then when a few months of poor speeds and still paying full bill passed i contacted them to have my contract ended since they lied repeatedly about my line and speeds.I was told i was a liar an that i never made a report of bad speeds in a roundabout way which i feel is more offensive than just saying it. I then made 3 subject access requests, the first was ignored blatantly, the second had the very conversation i requested missing as well as call recordings and other chat logs, the third was fulfilled and proved i was telling the truth. Despite this & the fact they accepted that they had wasted my time and acted disgustingly wretched by calling me a liar they still wont end my contract without me paying for services that havent been provided since billing is in advance & a contract end fee even though they have broke contractual obligations by not putting me on the fibre line like advertised & giving me 10% of the speeds guaranteed, however they're willing to offer me £10 credit as an apology but i still have to pay for services that wasn't given and a contact end fee.By far the most disgusting company i have ever had the displeasure of coming across, i STRONGLY suggest that anyone reading this avoids Vodafone at all cost, they're worse than every other Internet provider I've been with for speeds, customer service & lies.Should any evidence be needed to prove exactly what i have stated for vodafone not to have this comment removed claiming it's a false claim i have the chat logs and all relevant information & log numbers.Oh and don't believe the 5 star AI reviews that Vodafone themselves put up to boost their rating, its just another disgusting tactic they use to fool and lie to customers.",0
"First of all, thank you for your response. However, I would like to point out that if you check my record, you should see that I have already spoken with your Customer Service Team at least twice and expressed my dissatisfaction with your delays. Specifically, when you first informed me that the installation would be postponed to the 28th, I made it very clear to your team that I could only accept the 28th as the latest date and could not tolerate any further delays. This is because it has a significant impact on my work and my entire family’s daily life.However, less than 24 hours later, you informed me of yet another delay, pushing the installation date to December 17. I strongly urge Vodafone to thoroughly review my conversations with your staff before providing any response.",0
"I've had my mobile and broadband with you for a few years now. I've logged on the your website for deals and they are absolutely rubbish. So much cheaper just doing a Google search. Never once have you contacted me to offer me a good deal so I'll go elsewhere. You're not interested in keeping me as a customer so I'm not interested in staying with youUpdateYou messaged me to give me an ""amazing deal"" logged in Pixel 8 £10 upfront and £14 a month....tried to do it nope....I have two months left on my contract so it went to £40 upfront and £24 per month. You have ZERO idea how to keep your customers so off to Three I go.",0
"My relative has been in a care home for a year and has dementia, he has also lost his phone. Consequently, I thought I should cancel his account. I went  into a store and they said they could not help and I should ring their the Vodafone Critical Care team. This I did but again they said they could not do anything without the account holder speaking to them. My relative is not saying much that makes sense now so I'm not sure how that will work! Unless I can cancel they will keep taking his money even though he will not be able to use the account, how is this right?I do not have Power of Attorney so how do we get this resolved? I can give you the care home details and you can ask them.",0
"So here's what happened. I purchased a new eSim from Vodafone as a pay monthly customer through Carphone Warehouse. I also requested a switch to keep my number. Thought I found a good deal, however it was the start of a horrific experience with both carphone warehouse and Vodafone all together. None are better than the other.They've sent me the eSim through post apparently, which beats the logic, since it was supposed to be a ELECTRONIC SIM??? but they still send the QR code through post? Idk, very badly thought. They've used DPD, which again, very bad delivery company to deal with, can't work your way around with them. And because I was at work, they didn't want to deliver a sim card unless in person. Mind you, they got all the way to my flat door, and still didn't slide it through the door, my own address and my own flat, which could've been treated as handed to the resident too. Now they've failed to deliver every day until my old sim provider disconnected my services because of the switch, but the switch was not complete because I wasn't getting the sim to activate it. Multiple rounds of trying to contact Vodafone to sort this out, they were not interest to help me since the contrat was down through carphone warehouse, even if they were the provider. The order number was not Vodafone generated, therefore they didn't do the slightest to help.Back to carphone warehouse, their website is a shamble, a disaster, it's not working to contact them online, and because my phone got disconnected I was unable to make calls. I emailed, but as you guessed no one bothered to answer.So, as a last resort I tried Skype. I had to top up Skype, and was finally able to make a call using the home wife through Skype. The lady from Carphone warehouse customer service could not have been more uninterested to help. I asked her what the problem is, if I can change the delivery to be collected or any other ways. No, it was ""no"" answer to every solution I was trying to find. I couldn't collect, I couldn't change delivery address, she sent me back to Vodafone and told me to go to a store with my ID to ask for a new number. The absolute madness and insanity of this situation was mind-blowing. The immense amount of stress they've caused me by messing up with my Sim was tremendously horrific. I asked carphone warehouse to cancel my order, customer service said she will do it. I asked if I'll get a confirmation of the cancellation to which she said I will, but never received it.I'm in absolute livid state of how incapable the customer service was on both sides, and completely useless to the point of mockery. To make a mistake on your side, and then expect the customer to solve everything and go to all the stores in person to chase you for a sim card. You are all out of your mind for such a disgusting service.Finally, I had to get another contract, this time from O2, who was very easy to deal with. Got a new eSim card in half an our, which was directly installed in my phone, didn't have to do anything. Customer service was 5 stars and assisted me through the whole process even when I couldn't use my phone number to be verified, they found a way around. However I've lost my old number because of Vodafone and its mess.I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WILL USE VODAFONE OR CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AGAIN!!! AVOID AND RUN FAR AWAY WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF THEIR STORES, THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY CLOWNS AND SCAMMERS. NOW I HAVE TO CHASE TJEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO CANCEL MY CONTRACT, AND PASS ME FROM ONE TO ANOTHER TO HAVE IT CANCELLED. ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.",0
"I wouldn’t give it any stars if there was an option!I’ve been a customer since 2019. Initially the service was good now they became one of the worst companies in the UK.Their customer service is extremely poor, incompetent, very rude and reluctant to answer any questions.They are unable to understand the problem and they won’t help. They only keep repeating the same story over and over again without any sense.I’ve spent a significant amount of time on calls with Vodafone customer service without any conclusion. I’ve explained the problem repeatedly and followed all the suggested steps, despite the time and the energy I have invested in these calls the problem remain unresolved.Additionally, I’m paying for a service that doesn’t work, they just taking your money.I’m extremely disappointed with their terrible management, it’s a shame. One of the managers was supposed to call me for a problem I had and when they called they cut the call while I was talking.Ridiculous! If you are thinking to change to Vodafone don’t waste your time!",0
"Almost impossible to work with Vodafone and OpenreachStarted the process to get set up on Vodafone internet in the region now it is being offered alongside installation from openreach. It has now been 2 months since the initial installation date - 1 cancelled engineer apointment, 2 engineers meeting and 1 un-scheduled visit from the engineering team (that I was lucky to be home for) still no internet.It took 2 months for the internet to be not installed for them to raise an escalation to openreach and internally at vodafone after I wanted to complain.Here's the major problem, their complaints team also do nothing! There is no way to talk to openreach directly around the issues that they are facing on the installation of the internet, the agent who is ""assigned"" to my complaint just relays information from openreach.The past 3 calls I have had from vodafone around my complaint were to be told ""we will have to wait until 7 days from now until we know more"". I wait 7 days, and then the next phone call they give me is to give me exactly the same information. ""We're very sorry, nothing we can do, we have been told we have to wait until 7 days from now until we know more"".I feel like I'm going to be stuck in an endless loop with this service until the end of time.I asked for resolution and was told ""well you probably shouldn't go with another provider because you'll have to go through this all again"".Overall - ridiculous. I can't wait to get a message from vodafone about this review just to put me in to another complaint process that goes no where and they give me all empty promises.Honestly, the most frustrating experience I've had in my life for the least amount of money.",0
"I've moved from a different broadband over to Vodafone and ever since, I've been having a lot of problems which were either, not being able to connect to the Internet or a very slow Internet speed. On top of all this, it will randomly decide to drop out and disconnect from the device I'm using. Would recommend not choosing Vodafone.",0
"Offered free Amazon prime through rewards for 3 months but then charged me full price straight away,  so I cancelled my unused membership well within 14 days but have not been refunded, I will cancel with Vodafone as soon as I'm out of contract for this.Edit: I was charged full price  straight away  instead of the the supposed £1, the link I used was straight from  the vodafone rewards app if I didn't qualify for some reason  this should have been made crystal clear during the signing up process,  vodafone has got so expensive now it's the only reason I have stuck with them ,for the benefits,  it has put me off.",0
"Recently I switched to Vodafone for my broadband & home phone service from TalkTalk. Both of these use the Openreach network. For some reason, I'm still being billed by TalkTalk for ongoing service. I tried contacting TalkTalk, but trying to get any kind of resolution from them is borderline impossible.As for Vodafone, when you try to contact them, they don't even give you an option beyond a bot which, if it fails to find a solution for you (and it will fail, obviously - it just links to support articles) will pass you over to a human.Anyway, the conclusion I got after having to rephrase myself, because my request was seemingly misunderstood, is that, if I had selected the ""working line takeover"" option when I made the order, the previous ISP would have been notified.I'm not sure that there even was such an option. I didn't ever have to select such an option in the past when I was switching between Openreach providers - it's just assumed that the line is being taken over because, outside of some kind of fringe situation I can't imagine, why wouldn't it be taken over?I feel like I'm going crazy here because TalkTalk has their hand in my pocket, I can't get an answer from Vodafone on whether TT was notified which suggests that they don't even keep a record of it, and I don't want TT to take three months of billing from me for something they are literally not providing me but I seemingly can't get Vodafone to take responsibility for this so what can I do at this point?",0
Day 7 of problems with mobile phone signal in the Kendal area. It's almost impossible to make/receive calls or texts. Had the exact same problem a few months ago for 5 days.,0
"Vodafone obviously have quite a budget when it comes to fake reviews. The AI bots have generated pretty much every positive review. I would ask for my money back, they are all way too formulaic and everyone can see what you are doing. It's embarrassing. Here's a thought. Why not put all that time and energy into ACTUAL rather than fake customer service.",0
"Was told my partner's phone would be put back on after cut off around two weeks before end date never came back on, the customer service is terrible tbh and I myself left Vodafone ten years ago and havent gone back.Currently on the phone now it seems the staff are not trained correctly or do things on purpose. Having to wait 10 days for them to listen to phone calls where I know for a fact a PAC code should have been provided on the contract end date of today and now the account has been completely shut down and disconnected and there is no PAC code on the account! Simple process cannot be finalised and this was advised by the agent on the last call.Awful company would not advise anybody to go to Vodafone for anything.",0
"I made an order online to get new broadband. Vodafone cancelled it due to 'technical reasons' so they called me a couple days later, spent an hour and half on the phone with me processing the order again. Annoying as I lost my engineer appointment so everything was pushed back. I asked what the technical issue was and the guy gaslight me and said it was because I hadn't signed something. Whilst on the phone to him I checked all my documents they had sent and there was nothing about contract signing.Then a couple days later the called again to say it had been cancelled again. I pushed on this as it was a nonsense and the best I could get was something about a phone number which in both orders I said just to give me a new one. They said it was a Vodafone issue but couldn't give me a genuine reason. Also told me to try again in a month! For what just to cancel again and get delayed further. I can't wrap my head around technical issue = cancel order, it and absolutely idiotic way to run a business. Technical issue should just mean we have some time to sort the problem, you don't just cancel.Shambles of a company, gone to plusnet now but around 2 weeks lost of new service due to delays in engineer appointments.",0
"Awful service. I've been with them since March time and found it to be by far the worst broadband I've ever had, despite it being advertised as the quickest.I've had outages, devices unable to connect to a wi-fi router less than two metres away and unhelpful staff who have tried to blame me for not running LAN cables throughout my house, or who have ignored requests to not phone and deal with issues over email instead.Avoid if you want reliable internet.",0
"Shocking service. Robbed my money on a 24 month contract which couldn’t connect in my home, area or workplace. Went in my local store shortly after recovering phone and experiencing signal issues. The staff adjusting my settings and swapped sim and promised that issue was resolved. It wasn’t resolved and I have tried to contact Vodafone several times, the customer service is absolutely shocking! Very rude, disgusting service from customer service agents. I have made a complaint and still didn’t get a resolution. Was offered a refund that covers one months worth of paying, rather that 24 months that they have virtually robbed me. Was told it would be passed on to the ‘team’ over 2 months now and heard nothing since… I just want to be compensated for wasting my money on a phone contract that does absolutely nothing that I paid for after I was promised it was resolved! Next step to contact Ofcom for an actual result since Vodafone have the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Would never use or recommend to anyone.(Vodafone UK)",0
Really didn't want to have to leave a negative review but I am really losing patience.First there was issues getting our fibre live - issues passed between vodafone and openreach blaming each other. Absolutely no apologies or compensation from Voda from the time we were not connected to the service and still charged us full bill.Now Vodafone have not provided the voucher promised as part of taking the contract with them. Absolutely no help from the live chat team and the information given by them was of extremely poor quality and did not make any sense (assume a translator is being used for overseas staff?)Avoid Vodafone Broadband at all costs unless things drastically change.,0
"Terrible broadband and even worse customer service. I have been receiving a maximum download speed of 7mbs constantly and sometimes even lower even though my minimum guaranteed speed should be 32mbs. I have wasted countless hours on the chat to support who just seem to repeat themselves and I even agreed to upgrade to the full fibre and was told it would be activated the next day as they didn't need to do anything to then contact them 2 days later as the speed was even worse, to then be told that the order had been cancelled!? Then the next agent I spoke to wasn't even able to re confirm the order and said Id need to ring up again to a different person. I have asked multiple times to early terminate and that I wont be paying the fee as they aren't providing on their side of the contract and I just get the same repeated response saying they will fix it.",0
"I’m disappointed in this company, they increase the price. I can’t send photos by SMS despite the free MMS contract. Very poor coverage area.",0
"The Vodafone network is by far the worst mobile network in the UK. The network has been unavailable in my area for over 3 months (Vodafone are aware), with no indication as to when it will be fixed. My wife, two kids and I are all moving to a different company that actually cares about its customers.",0
"I purchased an Unlimited Sim card with Vodafone to be used with my mobile on Hot Spot for £33 PM. (which went up straight away to £36 PM) It worked for the first 2 months, I then moved address to Iver to an area that Vodafone assured me would have good reception.Here I get no signal, and fellow residents around this area say that Vodafone doesn't work in this part of town. I then contacted Vodafone who just say on there records there is good signal here, and would not help. I said that I would only make further monthly payments when they provide a service. They smugly said just carry on paying the bill or I would have debt collectors visit, so they want me to pay for a service that I am not receiving for the contractual period of 3 years at a thousand pounds for no service. I am a pensioner and can't afford to throw away money like this.I put up with this for a further 3 months and stopped paying, and now they are pursuing with collections agents.I have informed Vodafone that I will pay the arrears and the monthly payments only when they provide the service that our contract is for.",0
Expressed disappointment that I have a problem getting any straight answer re new broadband but not actually prepared to do anything about it !,0
"My phone line installation through BT was cancelled without Vodafone telling me. Stayed in for the appointment, nothing. Called Vodafone to see why, there had been an issue with the switch; again they made no attempt to contact me to resolve the issue or to cancel the appointment. I complained and had to start the entire process again. Because I had originally done this through a 3rd party reward (£125 gift card) I lost the incentive due to it being 3rd party and not available anymore. I complained as I had to wait another 4-6 weeks for the installation process. This was brought forward thankfully and I was advised they would provide compensation for the troubles; never happened.After a few months calls began to appear on our bill. We have no landlines phone, never plugged one in and never made a single call. Yet all they would say is they're ""legitimate"" calls. The first manager who dealt with this (in June) was excellent. Sorted out the charges and at my request but a call bar on the line to stop further charges appearing. Every month since we have been charged with calls, no one is taking my complaint seriously. They just like to point out all the ""charges"" of hundreds that are against our landlines. I've been in touch with the fraud team, line has not been hacked, so nothing else is worth investigating. I am always refused when I ask to speak to someone other then the basic call agent. It always has to be a callback upto 24 hours later. I'm refused when I ask to speak to complaints, I ask the issue to be escalated and still nothing. Today I even had an agent tell me that you can not bar landlines to stop calls being made and refused to let me speak about the complaint to anyone else.The agent even told me there was nothing I could do, no external governing bodies even denying a ombudsman could be used. He denied everything until I mentioned CISAS and then still refused me the chance to speak to anyone else and I'd have to wait 24 hours.6 months of the same issue and I'm treated like this? Congratulations Vodafone for not helping me at all**Update**Interesting how they have been in touch so much since I put my complaint into the sphere. After speaking to different people, none of which told me they had cancelled my contract, they have resolved the charges but then the complaints team told me it was cancelled and that they could not restore it, even though their mistakes caused the whole problem. If I wanted it back I would have to go through the whole process from the beginning to start a new contract. Utterly ridiculous, why would I be willing to start a new contract after all this? Gone to Plus net, cheaper, quicker and no phone line which take this whole issue out of the equation.",0
"I have been compelled to leave Vodafone due to their inability to assist me effectively.I visited a Vodafone store to discuss an upgrade, which I was due for, and was provided with pricing options. During this discussion, I mentioned that other companies were offering better deals and that I needed time to consider my options.I then called Vodafone to explore a better offer, but I was informed that they couldn't access my account for upgrades due to a technical issue. The agent said they would escalate my case to the SOS team.Two weeks later, I still hadn't received any updates, so I called again. The issue was still unresolved, and the agent suggested I either return to the store or use the My Vodafone app to explore upgrade options.I requested to speak to a manager, but they only repeated what the previous agent had told me. Frustrated, I asked for a PAC code, which they provided. I also requested to be transferred to the complaints department. I was put on hold, and when the agent returned, he asked me to explain my complaint. I informed him that I would discuss it directly with the complaints team.The agent put me on hold again to consult with his manager, who claimed she would reach out to the complaints team and then placed me on hold once more. After what felt like an eternity, I was finally transferred to a complaints agent, who reiterated the same issues—my account had a problem, and the SOS team had advised me to visit the store or use the app. However, the deals on the app were more expensive than those quoted in the store.At this point, it became clear that Vodafone doesn't prioritize customer retention or resolving issues. So, as a loyal customer, I’m saying goodbye to Vodafone.4o mini",0
I joined Vodafone for “unlimited broadband” in September and the service was dreadful from day 1. Almost every day there were periods where there was no connection for about 20 minutes at a time. Customer services in India went through their list of checks several times but it made no difference. I left after 4 very stressful weeks.,0
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a company. Purchased a new broadband service from them. They canceled the installation without telling us, I took a day away from working. Had several phone calls with them one lasting 57mins! They kept telling me that it was canceled because they couldn't transfer our number across. This we hadn't asked them to do and they even sent us a new number in the confirmation letter. I was offered £6.10 compensation for my wasted day off!",0
On September 23rd i placed an order for Vodafone broadband the highest package to be installed fibre pro 2 the first time fhe engineer from cityfibee came i was watching on the house cameras he walked into the garden and then retreated and ran off nevsr to be seen and i receieved an email to say that i missed ths engineers visit i was furious! I rang and rebooked and the engineers visit the second time he came they said they didnt have the right tools and equipment to install the broadband cable after this the engineer needed a form signed by the neighbours to say they dont mind any work being done fo the trees so then i wasted time and did that then since then its november now going into december nearly 3 months and these engineers have still not come to install the wifi they kept saying we're coming today and then they would never shoe up and everytime id ring vodafone their service was rubbish they kept using excuses that the cityfibre portal was down and that theyre sorry this has happened etc we got to november 19th i said forget it cancel this rubbish then the vodafone customer services tried to be clever and lie and say oh my order is in the point of no return! WTF! 1) no thats a lie because you havent even installed anything yet 2) the engineer never shows up 3) i have a cooling off period so dont try and bait me into feeling bad and saying i cant cancel then they advisor said oh it takes 3 days for the order to cancel so then i got a text couple of hours later saying its been cancelled now. I even said i wanted to log a complaint they kept saying no no the best we can do is get a managers callback so i had enough it was rubbish service and they took the absolute mick to just trim a few tree branches and install fibre broadband cable,0
"Totally hopeless, wanted to get a replacement SIM for my 83 year old father who recently had to get a new handset with which his SIM didn’t work. Vodafone simply could not understand that someone who is 83 is not in a position to comply with all their unreasonable requirements. After numerous calls and over a week I had to get a new SIM and move network. Father completely worn out by the whole discriminatory  ageist episode. At 83 he cannot be without a phone for obvious reasons but that didn’t stop Vodafone messing me about for over a week. Their answer / response was a £30 voucher for an account my Father no longer has. You can’t write this stuff. PatheticAnd what a surprise instead of just arranging a call they have responded with all manner of convoluted solutions to “find out more”",0
"I tried talking to vodafone, explaining to them that I need to be free from the contract because I changed my tenancy and since they cannot give me a good signal, I have to transfer to another network. I explained to them, I would not be transferring if they are able to give me a good signal. However they can only give my 1 bar signal and E for my internet. It is not in my control to have this signal, and if they cannot provide it, it is only fair that they let me go. They want me to pay a termination fee which I am not happy to accept since I am not the one who has control with the signal. They should take action. They change my sim to e sim but signal is the same. After repeated calls, I am still with vodafone. I am sufferring, depress and very frustrated. I work hard to earn my money, and I want to get the worth of my money, the service that they promise to provide. But, instead, a big company like vodafone will not process my request to end with them freely and continue to make me suffer. I am now isolated from contacting my family which is my only source of strength. I am been very sad and depress and might be thinking that maybe all bad things would happen to me eventually. I don’t understand why vodafone is so greedy and won’t let me go. This happened since 1st November and they have not taken action. They don’t care. They just want your money! I hope you are happy to waste my money. I hope you are happy to contribute further to my depression. I just hope whoever owns this company, this comes back to you a hundred fold. I hope you get so rich than you are now and still be unhappy!",0
"I’ve been a Vodafone customer for 8 years, but I’m leaving because their network has become completely unreliable. For months, I’ve dealt with constant network issues—poor signal, slow internet speeds, and frequent outages. Despite contacting customer service multiple times, nothing has been resolved. I rely on a stable connection for work and everyday use, and Vodafone has let me down.To make matters worse, they’re now trying to charge me £206 to leave, even though the reason I’m leaving is entirely due to their inability to provide the service I’m paying for. After nearly a decade of loyalty, I expected better treatment. Vodafone should take responsibility for their own network issues instead of punishing long-term customers for leaving. I’m not sure what to? Very disappointing.",0
Edit to Vodafone response below . I have tried phoning customer services for hours . No one had a clue to resolve the issue. Wasted hours .(Main message)I had to leave this company after poor customer service .Their customer service via the app chat atrocious . Wouldn’t help me with a simple contract merge . They wanted me to pay for two accounts simultaneously. Even though it’s one account as I upgraded. Then I have to pay 30days extra even though I am out of contract and gave notice to cancel,0
"RIP OFF BRODBAND‼️‼️‼️Do not trust is absolute rip off, scammers ‼️I bought a Vodafone mobile broadband in August 24 , data was disappeared in two hours, next month I turned off WiFi from my mobile to not use any broadband data also disappeared all data. So next month I removed SIM card from the broadband device for six weeks and phoned Vodafone to ask how much data I still have answer was non because you used it all.On to a question how was possible when SIM card was on the table for past six weeks answer was you can cancel your contract which will cost you £148 or add data which will cost you extra £25 a month.So please don’t trust you will loose money, you won’t have internet and on a top of everything you will have a lots of stress!",0
"I signed up for their broadband after just moving to the UK. My service didn't go live on the day they said it would, every time I called customer service they were not really interested in solving the problem but just buying themselves time so you exceed the 14 day free cancellation period and pay a fee. Even after them assuring me I would not pay for anything except the equipment, I got an email saying I now owe 164 pounds....Mind you I have never even used their wifi and any engineer can confirm this when they performed the checks.Every time customer service called me, it was to see my setup, which hadn't changed from the previous calls, the told me they would send ethernet cables on two occasions, both never came.No company has ever wasted my time as much as Vodafone, and to make it worse I had just started a graduate job where I had to study and work from home extensively the first two months, imagine this experience with no wifi. When I asked them to send an engineer to come check in person, they ignored my request. Visited the branch in person who said they could not help with broadband and that I should continue calling customer service. An absolutely horrific experience with them.",0
"So this is a bit of a long story that goes back to Dec 2023 when I entered the Swindon branch and took out a new airtime deal that was on a promotional offer for £33 a month reduced by 50% to £16.50 for the first 6 months. The sale advisor at the time confirmed that after the initial 6 months I will be able to cancel or switch to a cheaper deal. So once the 6 months almost elapsed and I received a notification that the 50% discount was ending I went back to the same store to cancel the deal only to be presented with a very rude and uninterested staff member telling me that cancellation is not possible, this was in spite of me explaining (sadly nothing on paper or recorded) the conversation with his colleague 6 months ago. At this point feeling so cheated I left the store and put this behind as a bad experience wishing I had kept record of the promise made to me in an email.Forwarding to the 30th Oct 2024, I went to the Bath branch to enquire about ways to reduce my £33 p/m phone bill and was told by Colin the manager that I could get a trade-in deal for my old phone which was inspected by him in exchange for a new Iphone 16 plan. I proceeded to signing the new contract and a few days later I posted my old phone using the provided packaging by Vodafone. Forwarding a few more days I received an SMS informing me that the old phone will be returned as it was damaged and therefore not suitable for a trade-in. This is the same phone that was insepected by the Manager at the branch when I took out the new contract. As the trade-in price was going to be added to my bill I proceeded to exercise my right to cancel the contract within the 14 days cooling period as suggested by the person on the web chat customer service and to also go back to the Bath store and explain the issue.This is what I did and ended up speaking to another Manager (as Colin with whom I took out the new contract was not there) who logged a formal complaint in the system and told me that someone from Vodafone would call me within 48 hours. As I was expecting this phone call never arrived. So going by all my negative experience with Vodafone, my question is do you incentivise your sales staff to sell contracts at any cost even if it means you make promises without delivering on them and deceive your customers? I shall never give your company anymore business, whether phone or internet.",0
"Needed an ISP as part of moving house and decided to give Vodafone a go. Ordering process was straightforward (although a bit convoluted) but the order went through and got the confirmation mails. Decided to check a few days later as to what my order status was and when I could expect to be connected again so used their chatbot. It couldn't help with order status so I asked to be transferred from bot to agent (who took all my information) to be transferred again to yet another agent (taking all the same information again) to then be told the order was cancelled for an ""Unknown"" reason. I guess I'll go with a provider who understands communication and customer support given Vodafone clearly doesn't want me.",0
"Absolute waste of time, cancelled my order without even telling me, when i contacted them to enquire why they fed me a list of possible reasons, this was all after i twice filled the form for the social tariff heard nothing back at all so decided to just go for a normal package, could at least have the decency to inform me that the order had been cancelled without my having to check myself",0
"I tried to cancel my business broadband with Vodafone as I switched to another provider providing better service in my area. I contacted Vodafone at least 10 times from February 2024 to November 2024 to do this very basic job . However, I keep going around in circles as their representatives keep raising new requests with their back - office team for an immediate disconnection . They write some notes and say there is a reference number showing up for the previous requests but for some reason , they have to create a new request. I am fed up listening to the same excuses and they literally have no shame to keep me informed and up to date . I am still being charged for the service I have no longer been using.One of their representatives asked me to cancel the direct debit, which I did either in June or July 2024 . However, I keep receiving emails to pay the bills as my account is still active , which I can also see when I log in to my account - the overdue amount.I never had such a terrible customer service experience in my whole life and will never recommend Vodafone to anyone. Their customer service is outsourced , and most of their representatives can't even speak proper English and don't understand what I am trying to say . Once I am done with the call with customer service , I never receive any message to give my feedback.Does anyone know how I can file my complaint with a third party that can take some action ?",0
"Here we go again... I write a bad review, Vodafone send Openreach round and did work I didn't really need but said someone would come back to do the work I did need doing.... still waiting.",0
Despite many many tries by Vodafone I'm still not getting the speed I'm paying for. One day I'm getting over 100 but mostly it's 50. The latest communication they said they tested it from their end and I'm getting the speed paid for over 100. I've tried all types of tests including Vodaphones own test and it disagrees with them. Something is not right and despite many tries by Vodafone they do not seem to know what the problem is.,0
Having  absolute nightmare with these. Installed boardband. 3 days later disconnected and no notifications email  phone call or letter. Spend over hours on the phone  still boardband not working. These are worse  than talktalk.,0
Trying to upgrade my current Vodafone broadband to Vodafone full fibre I accepted a good deal from them & received confirmation emails from them & Open Reach regarding new external cabling & the change in speed.Unfortunately OReach failed to turn up as agreed so I turned to Vodafone for help . I started with the compulsory online chat bot but eventually got a human responding. After a wasted 70mins I was told that despite the email confirmations from Voda & Open Reach the Vodafone agent online could find no record of my new contract & I was told to apply all over again for a new contract. My wife feels that that we should not stay with a company that behaves like this but I still naively hope that Voda will sort out this mess !PSJust had new response from Open Reach directing me to ask Vodafone to contact them on my behalf.Fat chance !,0
"This network is a joke. Traveled to Czech republic where data within the UK pack should be working. Vodafone sent me a message saying I have to purchase add-on for £9 to get 3gb of data. What a joke. Another issue, I topped up £10 to make an international call but it didn't work. Vodafone customer support told me I had to buy add-on for £7 to make that call (Montenegro - EU country). Excuse me? In addition, international SMS doesn't work. This is such a disgustingly greedy company I would never return to.",0
"Guy that served us was constantly texting on his phone, I couldn't reach the card machine on the high table fire too being in a wheelchair. Tried to bully us into a talking an add on I didn't want them said he gave it to us free because he was a nice guy 🙄",0
"Giving one star is an understandment. I have never experienced fraud until I ordered a broadband from Vodafone.From the salesperson online up to billing department.It's all lies, saying things and never delivering.After wasting my time over a month, I was offered a compensation and until date it was never given.",0
"went in to buy a wifi hotspot dongle. The lady set it up and made us sit there for half an hour saying something wasn’t right. after another half an hour of her doing nothing and staring at the screen without even clicking once, the shop was closing and we had to leave. what a wasted hour of my life. went into Three the next day and left with a hotspot dongle within 10 minutes. Vodafone service is just shocking, no manager in sight and clearly no idea what she was doing, as we sat in awkward silence for an entire hour. she even got the dongle out , scanned it, and then said it didn’t work. What a load of horse shit",0
"I have called on the 15/11/2024 (Friday), which my line was disconnected and mentioned by the non-business members, as the business customer service department is closed, and we cannot help, and I should call on Monday.As you could imagine the importance of Business Line, and broadband to a hospitality business, this interrupted my business for busiest days of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.( Monday )After a discussion on the phone, they were not able to guarantee the Line Number, if disconnected it would take 14 days to put my existing service back online, considering, my till machine, card machine, Ordering Systems.My line has been disconnecting for unknown reasons which they cannot clarify and said it is a ‘system error’ my line should be protected, and I should not be made vulnerable of this matter.This is the second time I am experiencing terrible customer service, first with Installing / Openreach and now disconnection.I will not recommend at all to my worst enemy.",0
The most idiotic customer service I've ever experienced.They simply don't understand anything that I request and constantly stall for time.A simple request takes over 30 minutes with Vodaphone customer service because none of the staff understand the issue and repeatedly ask the same questions.,0
"Terrible company,I will never buy anything from them againI had business broadband and all bad experience!!!!!",0
18/11 Have you read my content? I chatted with your CS twice and the issue wasn't solved besides a new order without dealt offers. Who’s responsible for the invalid order numbers? Those are generated from your company.I ordered 2 times from the compare broadband quote on Topcashback website. The later one made on 6th Nov with confirmation email. I traced the orders afterwards but CS claimed the orders didn't exist with inactive accounts. He also claimed he couldn't reactivate and just create new order without offers. My wife experienced once 2 years ago that created her current contract without cashback and vouchers offered as I hurried for the service. I think this company is really tricky and unreliable with the contracts. And I do hope Topcashback should stop the deals with it as it becomes notorious I believe.,0
My only regret is changing from BT to Vodafone. I never had netflix frozen with BT or bad whatsapp calls etc,0
"I’ve been without cell coverage for three days, and it’s caused disruption. On Friday, I tried to SMS a charity donation (Children in Need), conduct online banking, and work on a website for my business, all of which relied on SMS for verification. I couldn’t do any of it.When I tried to log into my Vodafone account for help, the platform needed to send me an SMS for verification—ironic, given the situation. I called the support line, and after some back and forth, the customer service agent initially suspected a failed SIM. I had to suggest checking network coverage, which they did, only to confirm that this was the issue.I politely shared my frustration and asked if any compensation would be considered for the undelivered service I paid for and didn’t receive. The agent suggested I call back again later as they didn’t have any mechanism to call me.It’s disappointing that Vodafone, as a leading provider, lacks minimum viable support or compensation processes for situations like this. Losing service for days is frustrating enough without needing to chase them for updates or resolutions.",0
"Charge more for a slower artificially capped service.  Tried to use their chat but 'Demi' was useless and did not assist in any way.You can currently get fibre 1 for £24 a month with a £30 voucher or fibre 2 for £23 a month with a £80 voucher. Fibre 1 is a slower, artificially capped version of fibre 2.",0
They continually failed to get my broadband set up and my emails stopped being responded to and i was sent in circles for hours on live chat. As a deaf and disabled individual without a mobile phone i am prevented from a simple task like logging into my account as a mobile phone code is required and because i didn’t have that i wasted over an hour on live chat and forced to use someone else’s phone who does not live with me so cannot log in unless they happen to be around.my  bill was also wrong and i was double charged.They don’t reply to my formal complaint and feel like i am being discriminated against for my disabilities.I told them i was deaf and disabled from the outset and had they told me there was no way for people like me to get help and no way to log in without a mobile phone code then i would never have signed up as it’s wholly unsuitable for me.No redress has been offered either and i don’t know how to cancel down and get my money back.complaint ref 120384148,0
"Vodafone offered me a good deal to switch my mobile to them, so I, stupidly, decided to go with them. Long story short , I have had no phone connection for 6 days now, I have spent hours and hours on the phone, being told all kinds of rubbish and untruths, the last of which was an absolute guarantee my phone would be connected today but of course it's not , I still don't have a phone. I can't go to another provider as Vodafone say they can't give me a PAC code at this point. I wish I'd never, ever gone near them. I will not be switching my mobile to them . They are one of the worst phone companies I've ever encountered. AVOID if you want to stay sane l.",0
"Shocking customer support.Terrible broadband speed and regular disconnections.Can't even log in to my account due to them sending a code to my old number (both my new and old mobile numbers are with them), even though I spoke to numerous call centre people. And the engineer that responded to my complaint about my connection dropping out called me when I wasn't at home and decided they'd mark it as fixed as it was intermittent.Caused nothing but frustration.",0
"Engineer didn't turn up to install kit. Started getting bills, obviously didn't pay. Despite many attempts to contact them to sort it out I was still being billed. 3 different debt collection agencies, 3.5 years, a black mark on my credit file, and I finally got somewhere. Grudgingly (and as if they were bestowing a favour) the account was cleared. I'm told the credit score will also be corrected. But refused to consider some kind of compensation in view of the stress, hassle and trouble I've been caused. DON'T TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGE POLE!Their reply is nonsense. They are extremely unwilling to help in any way despite their message to the contrary. I doubt if whoever wrote it knows anything at all about the situation.",0
"I cancelled my contract back in June via the online chat facility, which was a very lengthy process. My last and final payment was due for July. However Vodaphone continued to take payment in August and September. In October after realising this I cancelled my DD.Now all I get is threatening emails about an overdue account from an ""no-reply"" email.I have telephoned, explained the situation, also via the online chat, all Vodaphone want to do is keep you engaged with them for a very lengthy time and pass you from department to department.  I even emailed the CEO, but no response, and today I received another reminder to pay I debt I do not owe from again a ""no-reply"" email, again I gave emailed the CEO, but now the emails immediately get bounced back. This company is a complete joke",0
"It is so bad service the signal is bad every at city centre, all my friends straggling to hear me always there is problem also the internet hung up a lot, am regret it paying all that money for bad services, I’ve got one year left I will definitely leave forever 👎🏻",0
"Possibly the worst customer service experience I have ever had! I have had mobile broadband with Vodafone for 3 years, which has been great up until I tried to upgrade my contract a couple of days ago. In an incredible turn of events, I now have a cancelled contract and no upgrade, unbelievable! I couldn't even try harder to give Vodafone my money. After wasting approximately 4 hours on the phone being passed from enept person to enept person, being put on hold after hold. And all I wanted was to renew my contract and confirm my upgrade. This isn't the first time this has happened to me over the years with Vodafone.Customer service is everything and is very much worth going with a company that can actually look after you. I will be shopping else where for my mobile Internet, I would highly recommend you do the same",0
"Very poor customer care, I contacted Vodafone to explain I had recently had to stop work to look after my autistic daughter who had been taken out of school due to anxiety and asked if I could spread my payments, but this landed of deaf ears and I was only given a deadline for payment, a few weeks later vodafone disconnected my phone and also my daughters phone. Im a single parent and live in a remote area so this caused a huge problem as I didn't have a landline, I couldnt ring Doctors or Friends in an already stressful situation but Vodafone only cared about payment. A few months later my Mother died suddenly and this was devastating for all of our family, for the first time in 30 years I found my self using a public payphone to organize my mothers funeral and when I contacted Vodafone and explained they once again demanded payment before they would reconnect. Ive been with Vodafone for 26 years and would never recommend this company to anybody, absolutely no empathy or care what so ever for their customers. Steer well clear of this company and use one of their competitors.This network provider doesn't even deserve the 1 x star ive given, sadly there isn't a zero star option.",0
"This is the second part of a review. Without going into long and boring detail, there was an issue with my daughter’s eSIM in Liverpool, with me (the account holder) in Brentwood Essex.  On the first visit Liverpool staff sympathetic but unable to help. On the second visit, involving the very helpful Vodafone staff in Brentwood, the guy in the Liverpool store was appallingly rude to both my daughter and the Brentwood store staff, (witnessed by all of us because it was on a FaceTime call) leaving her in tears and us thinking that the only explanation for his conduct was that he was working his notice.  When eventually the Brentwood staff asked how they could find a solution for this Vodafone customer, his response was to walk away, saying it wasn’t his problem. The zero score in the title is harsh, because the first Liverpool employee was at least polite and sympathetic, but the second fully deserves zero stars.PS.  Are you seriously suggesting (through the links below) that the way to address this is through social media sites? Is that how you do customer service?",0
"I am exhausted trying to discuss anything with these people because they out and out LIE.EDIT****  I don't have facebook or Twitter, or Instagram.  It is impossible  to contact you any other way and you keep sending me text messages that won't load and I can't read!!  You know I can't read the texts because you put a stop on the data!!

Vodafone staff are telling things, which turn out to be NOT true.Never deal with this company again and will post publicly everywhere.",0
"Got full fibre 100 broadband with this company and I have had constant Internet dropping issue's and everytime you call them they say let's do a test and each time it gets worse, the advisers are useless as one said is issue with the router then the next on didn't have a clue and telling me that the test won't affect me being on teams meeting which it did everything froze Great voda. They put it on test for two days and still same issue no change. Now that I want to cancel my contract because they are not fulfilling there side of the contract they want  £147 for the rest of the contract. Do not sign up with them they are a joke customer service is crap same as the broadband.DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM.AT ALL. they want to charge you for not supplying the service they said they will do. 👏👏💩",0
"Abysmal customer service! For 5 days we've been told to wait 24 hours for our 500mpbs speed Internet to work but it's reaching no higher than 75.1mpbs!

Still awaiting a resolution and just want to leave the company at this point and go for sky!!",0
"Have been with you for over 20 years,  pay a contract for me, my wife and daughter,  in recent weeks my daughter and I have stopped receiving the feel good Friday notifications,  yet my wife continues to do so,  not sure what criteria you are using and why my daughter and I are being discriminated against but suffice to say all 3 of us will be moving to another provider whenever is convenient to us",0
"Helping a disabled friend on PIP sign up to the social tariff. Tried 3 times, got contact from a person at Vodafone on one occasion but then that vapourised. The social tariff doesn't exist because you can't access it.

Vodafone sends me to an unofficial complaints page? No thanks, that page looks like a joke. I'll leave my complaint as it is.",0
"Awkward company. They've messed up my number when I upgraded to a contract sim. Now I have 2 numbers and I've rang up twice about it and it's still showing 2 different numbers randomly... sort your system out.Costing me money. Customers don't know it's me , family don't know it's me... loosing money and costing me time and all sorts of problems. Absolute joke. Will probably have to cancel the contract and take the number to another network.Shocking treatment. Not to mention the fact I paid extra monthly to be able to have more international data. Because I live on a boarder in Ireland. I'm limited to like 25gb a month because where I live I'm always roaming even though I'm still in the UK.Just feel robbed.",0
"Dreadful customer service. I am moving house and do not have a date confirmed, so I contacted Vodafone and explained that I only know a rough time which is a few weeks, the agent said this is fine as I can book a slot for 2 weeks, and then simply call to delay it for as long as I'd like until I get a date confirmed so that I do not go without internet, sounded good, so firstly they set it up for the wrong address, so I spent another hour on chat changing that, then I was told an engineer is needed, then they told me no engineer needed, they finally got the right address and it was booked to go live on the 19th, still no move in date so I go to chat to delay it, another hour on chat constantly repeating my full name and account number over and over, only to be told that as its a migration, the date cannot be amended, so I was lied to from the start just to keep me as a customer. Very dishonest company and agents who have zero clue what they are talking about.",0
"I was with vodafone for 7 years.  I never missed a payment, all taken by direct debit.  The last and final payment was also taken by direct debit.  Now they have waited 2 years to say the final payment was just over £1 short and they have sent it to a debt collection agency and have totally ruined my perfect credit rating.  They say they emailed and text me but I received nothing.  No use trying to tell them anything they just say 'the computer says'.  Was thinking of going back to them as the reception is better in our area but I am unable to trust them anymore.",0
"Please don't have anything to do with this company, they miss sell you contracts to earn  thier comission, they constantly tell you on the phone your complaint is sorted, only to find nothing has changed. And don't in any circumstance give them your bank details. You have been warned. On going problem since end of July .",0
I was on phone trying to see if I could transfer a contract over to somebody else. My main purpose of calling was to ask for advice on the situation and step by step instructions on how to do it and the phone was put down on me twice by the same woman. I’ve been with Vodaphone for a few years and I’ve never expected to be treated like this at a very crucial time. Do better!!!!!,0
They send fake gift card and I have reported it to the police,0
II have rarely endured such inefficiency from a company. They have sent not one but two iPhones to me in error. Vodaphone have stolen £31.99from my account-no permission was given by me. I have had approximately 15 phone calls from vodaphone in the past 2 days. They have now told me my card has been cancelled AND THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN MY BANK ACCOUNT BEFORE MY MONEY IS REFUNDED,0
"My name is John Walker, and I’m writing on behalf of my 72 year old father.Long story short! After learning that my dad was overpaying for his mobile service provided by Vodafone, I searched for a better (cheaper) deal. I picked up a Lebara SIM card for him and asked him to get a PAC code from Vodafone. When speaking to the Vodafone rep via web chat, he really didn’t seem interested in retaining my dads business and when he was asked for the PAC code he asked which network my dad would be switching to. When he was told Lebara, the rep told my dad that Lebara use the Vodafone network and that he could not transfer his Vodafone number to his new Lebara sim, the rep said this a few times. I told my dad that I thought this is nonsense and to insist on getting the PAC code and then switch the number using the Lebara website, the rep gave my dad the PAC code. My dad then put the details of the Lebara phone number, his Vodafone phone number, the PAC code and the date that he wanted the number transfer to occur into Lebaras website, and we said let’s see what happens. The number transfer happened as requested, there was no problem at all!Why did Vodafone blatantly lie to my dad and tell him that he couldn’t keep his number? I consider this entrapment and fraudulent behaviour! It’s also cheating a pensioner out of his pension and it’s a bear faced lie! All to try to trick my dad into staying with Vodafone and charging him more for an inferior mobile package. Utterly disgraceful and disgusting behaviour from Vodafone!",0
"ONE OF THE MOST RUBBISH SERVICE I EVER GET, AS THEY CANT PROVIDE SERVICE ON MY NEW ADDRESS THEY TOLD ME TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT AND SAID WE NOT CHARGING YOU FOR TERMINATION CHARGES, HOW SOMEONE CAN BELIEVE THAT THEY WAVING OFF TERMINATION CHARGES. NOW I CANT SEE IN MY ACCOUNT FOR ANY UPDATION AS THEY ALREADY DISCONNECT MY ACCOUNT AND WHEN I CALL THEM BACK TO GET ANY UPDATE THEY SAID THEY CANT UPDATE ME AS MY FINAL BILL ISNT GENERATED. I ASKED TO RAISE A COMPLAINT WHICH WAS DENIED OVER THE PHONE REASONING THEY CANT DO IT AND TOLD YOU WILL GET A CALL TO REGISTER WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED.",0
"I have been a Vodafone mobile and broadband customer for a couple of years and it has worked out ok. Vodafone has a separate app for broadband which enables customers to manage their home broadband from their mobile device and then an app for the other services (mobile, mobile broadband) for account management. When I renewed my mobile phone subscription with them, they amalgamated my billing. What seems to have happened is that they then disassociated the broadband from the main account (although they still bill me for it). When I tried to find answers online, their chatbot wasn't working and the answers in the community forum with any useful information had all been deleted by Vodafone. These are literally the only way that you can get in contact with Vodafone through the Vodafone website or app. I ended up trawling through social media to try to find an account of theirs and found one on Twitter (X) - on that, there is a message for Vodafone UK saying that you can direct message them for help . They have literally disabled their website and are relying on a third party social media platform to run their help desk, for those customers who haven't lost the will to live by the time they reach it. The help function they run via X is on a turn based system, so someone responds to you and then you don't hear anything for minutes at a time as they help other people. It's the most inefficient and ineffectual help system I've ever come across, and I used to be a BT customer so I've experienced some pretty terrible helpdesks. It's unbelievable.",0

I chose vodafone as they were £5 cheaper than BT. I just canceled during my cooling off period. Ill happily pay £5 extra to BT for good customer service and peace of mind.1.the dpd driver made not attempt to deliver the router to me even to go as far as to take a pic of a random address.2. I could not access my online account therfore I had no access to my bills.All this with in 2 days. They can get out of town!The low price is not worth it save yourself the time as hassle.,0
"I had broadband put into my new home 3 months ago but has very weak broadband strength, if I go any further than 15 feet away from the router it cuts out .Our ring doorbell is no more than ten feet away and it has trouble staying connected to the router , Iv rang them numerous times and they say it’s my fault as the router should be up above the tv so it transfers the signal better lol 😂Anyway I did this and it’s still the same .I asked if they could send me a new router and they have ignored me ever since",0
"Really bad , why1  I did a new broadband contract with them 3 months ago . Not only have I not received the package after 3 months and 5 hours of phone calls they have now disconnected my old router even though I'm still paying for it . Please give up foreign call centres as although they speak English they don't speak English well enough . Example ; how do you spell Peter and how do you spell Lancashire!I despair.",0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Cancelled my order TWICE without my knowledge or permission leaving me over three weeks into a new home with no broadband. I rely on broadband for work and they don’t seem to understand the seriousness of my situation. They have refused to see if they can activate me as per my second cancelled order date, instead offering me a sim to put into my O2 phone! I would never recommend Vodafone broadband to anyone.",0
"Absolute thieves.  Paid £150 deposit for a laptop but returned it.  After they received the laptop back they erased everything from my vodafone but instead  of refunding my money they have credited it to my account and will not refund until after my next bill.  I don't have a bill and when I asked when my money would be refunded back to my bank seeing as the laptop account no longer exists they wouldn't tell me and kept copying and pasting the same generic rubbish about not to worry and one of their dedicated customer service reps will sort it and completely evaded the question.   I unfortunately have a phone contract and my home broadband with them but as soon as these contracts end I will be going to another provider, the way they treat their customers is shocking.",0
"Had to put a star.we have never dealt with a company where customers service is so shocking as we have now been waiting since 30/09/24 for broadband connection. Since then our original order which was through U Switch was cancelled apparently due to missing calls from Vodafone ( which were not necessary as we were given an installation date ) and they had offered us £200 approx credit due to delays caused by Vodafone, also £95 voucher from U Switch when we made contact with Vodafone after taking the day off work awaiting installation, we were informed “ connection cancelled all offers were now void ie credits and we needed to try again “ frustrated we did this and were told by “ Amir” that connection date was now 19/11/24 we also explained to “ Amir” that we were away this week, BUT, came home to SIX missed calls on our landline and had received a text on mobile and would call us back within the hour?! No call on mobile ( again? We had an installation date so why all these calls??) We told the chap we just called…..would you believe his name was “ Amir” and said forget it we may as well stick with our current provider to omit any further stress.",0
"Vodafone continue to hide behind the 3rd party scammers Onecom Ltd, despite the contract being with the scammers, Vodafone sit quiet collecting the direct debits. Asking their useless, customer relation manager?? Emmar, who fail to provide information regarding your commencement date of the DD, not that he can be understood anyway. It is about time Emmar, was promoted to compiling the 10 fake reviews per hour on trustpilot, so they remain at a fake 5 star. If you took Vodafone’s fake reviews away, it would reveal the one star company they really are.",0
"I got a Vodafone PAYG SIM as a backup for my usual phone and I put £40 of credit on, only to find that £20 was taken without my permission and applied to the 'Big Value Bundle', the most expensive of the rather expensive bundles offered.I contacted customer services to gain no satisfactory response as to why this happened. I explained several times that I wished to make a formal complaint and I was ignored, after being in a webchat for almost an hour (it was eventually cut off). It was an appalling experience.",0
"Useless. Slow to react and don't actually care. Let my number be moved fraudulently to another network via a PAC request - despite me reporting the attempted fraud - and completely disinterested in fixing the issue. Customer service staff unable to do anything as ""my number wasn't on their system"". Clearly unable to keep data safe. Stay away.Update (after Vodafone's hollow, corporate C&P reply): I did manage to talk to the fraud team, after strongly insisting to the customer service team that they put me through. The fraud was reported on Monday, it is now Thursday & Vodafone still can't even tell me if my number has been blocked yet.It would appear that GiffGaff might be even worse, as it was to there that my number was fraudulently ported.",0
Not happy. I got a call of vodafone to set up a new contract has my old contract with them was coming to a end. So I did but on sim only and a free cheap handset . They said they would also pay the remaining balance of my old contract. They lied to me they don't pay off your remaining balance. Don't believe them if they tell you thisJanice mcdonnell,0
I was recently assisted by Bilaal in the Stratford-upon-Avon store whilst setting up a new business contract. Bilaal himself was very helpful and knowledgeable. I have been attempting to transfer my business contract with O2 to a new business contract with Vodafone. I first visited the Stratford-upon-Avon store in October 2024 and the team were unable to assist me on the day due to technical limitations and my limited company credit check being unable to be processed. I spent approximately three hours in store whilst the team called multiple departments trying to resolve the system issues but in the end they were unable to successfully set up a new business contract for me. I visited the store again in November 2024 and experienced the same issues with my bank details being greyed out on the internal Vodafone systems meaning my credit check could not complete. As at the time of this review I have still been unable to successfully set up a new business contract with Vodafone. The team were as helpful as they could be but due to the incredibly poor and outdated computer systems I am still unable to open a new contract for my business phone. This is taking a considerable amount of time and is no closer to being resolved. I would advise Vodafone upgrade their systems for business credit checks and completely re-evaluate how they service business customers in store. This is some of the worst provider service I have ever received and I would not recommend Vodafone to any other business owners looking to set up new contracts going forward.,0
The customer service is beyond horrific.  I have been waiting a month without broadband.  I raised a ticket weeks ago and the only way I can get an update is by continuously going through their TOBi AI chatbot (takes about 15 mins round the houses each time of irrelevant questions and answers before eventually being transferred to an adviser).,0
"Went to local Vodafone store to transfer 3 existing mobile numbers, got what seemed a good deal but told could only do 2 numbers now and the third in 30days.. just pop back and we will do it.. 7months on several visits to store cannot transfer 3rd number. Total joke have been mid sold product.. spoke to call centre no joy, asked to raise complaint as been mid sold product.. was offered £50.. declined the offer as what I require is 3 sims not to be bought off.. So going to persue complaint",0
"I have been a customer of this company since 2016. Initially, the service was very good, but it has now become one of the worst companies in the UK. The customer support is extremely poor, and the staff are rude and reluctant to answer questions. This is not the first time I’ve had a bad experience with customer support; they don’t provide proper responses. Additionally, I’m being charged extra for no reason. I’m truly disappointed with the terrible management—it’s honestly shameful.",0
"I went on the live chat, asked to speak to a person. I was informed it would take between 1 and 3 minutes. When they eventually came on the chat, they asked my name then cut me off whilst I was typing it! What is the point of providing a service that does not work? Vodafone have now replied by suggesting I raise the issue on social media! I do not have either an X account or an instagram account.  I use facebook to keep in touch with my friends, not so that I can report a problem.  I cannot wait to leave this company once my contract ends",0
"Went on chat to cancel my broadband since I am now redundant I need a cheaper contract, I was persauded by them to start a new lower priced one, but after they had confirmed the order. The representative went through the annual increase which amounted to effectively a16:67% increase in fees after only 5 months.. unimpressed so I said forget it.. after 3 1/4 hours I transferred again to a 4th person! And he told me it could be cancelled as it was “beyond he point of no return” WTF!!! Representative refused my request to escalate. Even when I pointed out the law requires a 14 day cooling off notice… and effectively just told me to ring in!! Then after I pointed out the law to him he…. Transferred me back to the original department!….. at that point I waited in another queue…The chat essay was now a good 10 min read.Who said they couldn’t do a cancellation and sent me on to a 6th person. Who finally worked out that the 1st person had done an immediate change which no one else was able to reverse… how appalling.4hrs 25 mins of my time I will not get back!",0
"The service is diabolical, ordered a phone, it took 2 weeks longer than promised, missed her birthday. I paid £800 upfront payment. Told by customer services she could collect it, they wouldn't do so, cancelled order, but then found out it wasn't cancelled, holding onto the money, apparently another 10 days now to get money back. Shocking as soon as we can all leave this network we are gone.",0

"I'll start with a positive to show this a balanced review. I had broadband with Vodafone for 2 years and the service was very reliable. No complaints there.The problem started as soon as I migrated to another provider using OTS (One Touch Switch). All seemed to be fine in that the new service started on the agreed date, Vodafone's service ceased on the same date. However, Vodafone has kept billing me. I have been on the phone to them umpteen times over the past month, each time for about an hour at a time. I am given the same explanation each time in that their system shows the service in some kind of stuck mode (do I really care about their internal systems?) and that the correction would be made within 2 to 3 working days. It never happens.After several rounds of this, I have asked to speak to someone more senior as I have grown tired of being given the same explanation and nothing getting resolved. Their managers seem very reluctant to speak to a customer as not one has ever come on the line. I think their front staff try to do their best but they seem powerless to either resolve the problem or to engage a manager.I am now so dissatisfied, I will most likely contact Ofcom/ombudsman.Update on 15/11/24 following Vodafone's reply:Like many people, I don't use X or Instagram. If the Vodafone team/person that posted the reply was sincere in wanting to look into this matter, they would have looked up the account number I included with the original review. I thought that was what it was for, no? More of Vodafone looking at things from their perspective rather than trying to see it from the customer's.",0
"I ordered Full Fibre broadband, which required both external and internal installations. The external work was completed in preparation for the installation inside my flat, initially scheduled for Friday, 8th November 2024.1) On Tuesday, 5th November 2024, at 15:36, I received a text from Vodafone informing me that both my order and the engineer appointment had been cancelled.2) Upon investigation, I learned that a neighbour had lodged a complaint about a City Fibre engineer allegedly using an unauthorised key to access the building. This matter had nothing to do with my order.3) City Fibre then informed Vodafone that the work was **on hold** and requested that Vodafone obtain clarification from me to ensure all parties were agreeable to proceed. My neighbour confirmed that his complaint was solely about the key-cutting incident and did not pertain to the work itself.4) Vodafone misunderstood or mismanaged this request and cancelled my order without contacting me for clarification.5) I contacted City Fibre, who confirmed they never requested the cancellation. They read their notes verbatim, with timestamps, and reiterated that they needed Vodafone's instruction to proceed.**From my perspective, the solution was straightforward. The City Fibre engineer had already completed the initial phase of the installation and only needed to complete the work in my flat. All that was needed was for Vodafone to contact City Fibre to confirm that no neighbour requested the work to stop. However, Vodafone chose not to take these steps, even though I had arranged time off work for the installation on 8th November 2024.**---Over two days, I spent countless hours calling Vodafone, navigating automated systems and speaking to service advisors who told me they could not reverse the cancellation or directly contact City Fibre. Vodafone repeatedly blamed City Fibre, while City Fibre stated they could only act on Vodafone's instructions. This lack of transparency and ownership left me in the middle, managing the coordination myself.**Additional Frustrations**- Service advisors directed me to place a new order on the website, which I did, only for it to be cancelled again at 11:26 on Wednesday, 6th November 2024.- Most service advisors refused to transfer me to the ""home broadband"" team until one agent eventually did. This agent promised to expedite the issue with City Fibre and follow up with a call between 17:30 and 18:30 the next evening but failed to do so.- I had to contact Vodafone again, and after extensive discussions, an advisor escalated the issue but could not connect me to a manager, resulting in another 24-hour wait for a callback.- A manager called on Thursday, 7th November 2024, only to inform me that their only option was to raise another formal complaint, adding another day to the process.- Shaiana from customer care called the following day, not to discuss my complaint but only to transfer me back to the ""home broadband"" team, where a third order was placed over the phone, which was subsequently cancelled on Tuesday, 12th November 2024.**Update**I have been contacted by Vodafone Customer Care, who advised that ""City Fibre requires up to 120 days to obtain permission"" to complete the work. However, the agent was unable to clarify what specific permission is needed. This statement directly contradicts City Fibre, who have already completed the initial phase of the installation and were scheduled to finish the work within my flat.Vodafone has also confirmed that they cannot provide interim broadband and no longer offer broadband services that are not Full Fibre. As I cannot wait 120 days without an internet service provider, Vodafone has effectively left me with no choice but to take my business elsewhere.",0
"I am experiencing the worst customer service Ive ever experienced. There is no possible way to speak with someone at vodafone it’s an impossible task. I have  submitted a transfer of ownership form on 23rd October, everything completed as requested as I am trying to switch to a business account and I have heard nothing except it was in process.I have tried contacting and when you call and try and speak to someone you get the automated everything choices but no option to speak with someone it then just ends the call on me. The chat bot says I haven't been able to transfer with various stupid responses ! How on earth do you run a business for customers with no way of actually speaking with anyone.Im going to have to now cancel my account and switch providers I cant  have a business account with someone who offers zero help or assistance in-the form of a real person.Having spoken to a chat person they advise the transfer was stopped as they called my daughter ( who knew nothing about transfer) and she said she didn't know about it? Its not her account nor the name on the account so why even speak to her. I spoke with them after this and confirmed it was confusion on her part and to still process however they have not processed for this reason. So what can I do? No help what so ever, just call this number but the number provided on the chat doesn't even exist. Absolutely useless!!! Tell me how I am supposed to resolve when you have no support in place for me, currently looking at EE I hear customer service is far better.",0
"Have spent 4 days trying to get a contract for my house. System keeps telling me my personal details are wrong. They are not wrong. No one at Vodafone is able to help as I was trying to sign up via moneysupermarket.com where I was going to get voucher for £100. If I get help from Vodaphone I loose the £100? Their system is not fit for purpose and it is going to cost me money. Wrote an e mail complaing, then filled in complaints form. Vodafone wrote and said they would contact me by phone. Four days later staff at Vodafone have not worked out how to ring me on my mobile phone. Not a Vodafone one, thank god, but on their network. I have been told nothing but lies that they had called me a number of times. To add insult to injury I am a shareholder! Have told them! Still treated badly. Ah well I am very disappointed. I have terminated my contract with my previous supplier. Unfortunately where we live there are few suppliers and even fewer offering a telephone connection. Mobile signal in house is very poor. I am on holiday at the moment so have use of internet. When I return home I have no way of getting this sorted. Thanks Vodaphone UK.",0
"Absolutely Terrible service, internet doesn’t work even though you pay an extortionate amount a month for their service. Would advise everyone not to use their services.",0
I have been without service for two weeks. Apparently engineers are still examining my account. When I joined I ported my number over. I was allocated a temp sim in the interim. That temp sim they then made my permanent. Trying to undo that stuff up has been sheer hell and nobody at Vodafone could give a monkeys. I’m now paying for a service I can’t use. Vodafone don’t reach out with updates or offer any solutions or recompense. I can’t cancel the account or port my number to a different carrier as it supposedly doesn’t exist on their network. Vodafone is the definition of incompetence and customer apathy. Im literally being extorted right now with seemingly no remedy in sight.,0
"Broadband internet has done nothing but disconnect 4-5 times a day for the last few weeks. Tried different routers. Tried different sockets. Still the same thing. Ring up Vodafone ""Nothing is wrong on our end, please give us access to your camera so we can see your router."" I say no because I don't have a phone that can do that. ""Then we can't assist you."" Garbage service, EE cost more but they were a lot more helpful than the ""Tech Experts"" they have for this joke of a company. Even whilst writing this it has disconnected yet again. God awful. Can't wait for my contract to be up so I can switch to someone else.",0
"Terrible customer experience. I bought a phone last Wednesday from Vodafone which was meant to come with an e-sim. Nothing has been issued so i cannot make calls, text or use data. I provided my PAC code at the point of purchase to transfer my number from O2. On Friday O2 disconnected my old mobile confirming the number had been transferred to Vodafone however Vodafone have not activated the esim on their end. I went into store and after waiting 45 mins to be seen, was told there was nothing the store could do as they can see on their system the e-sim is sat under ""processing"" on my Vodafone account and if i wait until 5pm I'd receive a QR code to activate.  No email was sent by vodafone.Today I have spent 30 mins on the phone with Vodafone customer service having to prove there is an issue before they would even look into my account.  Conclusion is they will now send me a physical sim and cancel the esim on their end.  I now have to wait another 48 hours in the hope a physical sim comes in the post.All the while Vodafone started a contract for me on 5 November and are charging me airtime for a phone that has no network! I cant make calls, cant text, no data. Yet you're charging me for it.  I wish i stayed with O2.  Avoid Vodafone at all costs.",0

12 days down the line hours wasted trying to contact Vodafone with 3 attempts to send a router but still nothing. Our connection line now seems to have a block on it so we can’t even take out Broadband with another company. Which is made even harder with no telephone line or internet. Told I would receive compensation but only if I stayed with Vodafone…!!!!????Last review told me contact Vodafone via Facebook to discuss which has just wasted more time. I really wish I could review -5* here,0
"My partner and her daughter went in only to get another SIM card for a new phone because the one in her existing phone was a micro and the new phone needed a nano in order to transfer the number and contacts over. The sales person seemed ONLY interested in selling a contract to her. Then proceeded to tell her that her existing number was inactive and no longer in service. Which I knew was a lie because we had tried to transfer the number and contacts and couldn't because there was no SIM in the new phone. Prior to that, Vodafone sent a security code to the existing phone number in order to allow the transfer of the number and contacts to a new SIM. Which is how we knew that her number was still active.Misleading and lying to customers. Should and will be reported to Vodafone head office.",0
My broadband speed is terrible on an evening. Great during the day getting 900mb. In the evening 20mb. Customer service is terrible they just blame you. Still got nearly 2 years left stuck with this awful service. With BT for 5 years didn't have to call them once. Don't be sucked in by cheap offers. Their network is dire and the customer service is even worse.Update- thank u for replying but nobody at vodafone will help they're utterly useless now stuck for the best part of 2 years with terrible broadband,0
"If you have issues with Vodafone, report them to Ofcom (their regulator) by searching “Complain about mobile, phone or internet services” on Google. Select your issue (billing, faults or service problems, etc) and click the link: ‘let us know by filling out our short monitoring form’. Nothing changes unless we notify Ofcom of their failings.UPDATE: Yesterday, Vodafone said the line was finally active (18 days after it was transferred to their network, one day after their supposed final, final, FINAL deadline). Plot twist: it still is NOT working. They are trying to bill us £13.87 for the same non-functional line. Of that £13.87, future me apparently incurred additional charges of £3.87 on 21 November (it’s 10 November). We still did not receive the call promised on 8 November 2024 from the manager of our case handler (Emma). The agent we spoke to yesterday (Ahmed) promised a callback and then flashed us so the system would register that he tried to call even though he had no intention of actually speaking to us. Ahmed sent a text message to ‘SIM swap’, but when we followed the instructions, the website and app said there was an error. They have still denied the PAC code and the deadlock letter.Background: On Monday 21 October, Vodafone said that after 24 to 48 hours, the telephone number (used for over ten years) would be transferred to their network at a much better rate. On Wednesday 23 October 2024, the telephone line transferred into the Vodafone network and stopped working. To this day (10 November 2024), there still isn’t any network at all. My partner and I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone with them. Each time, we are told by various agents (Sarah, Mo, Emma, and so many others) to wait 24-48 hours. Now we have to add a 24-hour wait to speak to a manager when it was previously instant. We requested the PAC code to switch networks on 1 November 2024. To date, we do not have the PAC code for the line (even though Ofcom say it should be provided within a maximum of two hours after the end of the call). We asked for a letter of deadlock to report them to Cisas. They refused to provide one.Reply to pending Vodafone response: It’s been 19 days, and the so-called technical issue has neither been resolved nor explained (complaint 122386655). To top that off, Vodafone wants to charge me over £13 for a line that never worked. It's funny how there’s always a higher department whenever we call to complain. I, of course, responded to their email, yet we still do NOT have a functional telephone line.Please take note, everyone – this is how they pass you around like a hot potato, hoping you’ll just give up.",0
"Vodafone - No, I won't communicate with your Social Media team.  That's what you did the last time to take it out of sight of the public and still the problem persists.  I want to speak with a management level human being who can get this fixed once and for all.  I said the same thing to the social media person who contacted me on X.  And the discussions will be put on TrustPilot so Vodafone actually deals with the issue and fixes it.--I thought we had this worked out.  But again - Vodafone cancelled FIVE attempts to top up my mobile number - using 2 different cards - online from my account and calling in to Customer Service.  Aside from the fact that the Customer Service Rep had no interest in listening to what I was saying - I WANT TO KNOW WHY VODAFONE IS NOT ACCEPTING MY PAYMENT.  There is no problem with money in either card.  I have been successfully paying ONLINE and via the SAME phone number for 3 months.  Now - out of the blue - the same problems again!  What IS the issue???  4 Days to get this sorted.  I have money left on the account and 13 GB of data on this account.  Contact me on the number.",0
"Dreadful experience with Vodafone broadband. Don't fall for the price and gurentrees of speeds.I live in a medium sized house and the internet only works in the same room as the router and it's painfully slow.Trying to get in contact with customer service is like banging your head on the brick wall. The 24/7 available 'Tobi' AI chat bot is never online when you're logged in as an existing customer, but very much online when you're not logged in and not a customer.I wish I never left Virgin Media (which is something I thought I'd ever be saying)",0
"Just a follow up on my earlier review about Vodafone , conveniently  for them , they cannot find a recording of an important conversation between myself and one of their agents and the latest agent I have been dealing  with has basically been lying to me .The agents you speak to are working from their homes ,in India , and by the sounds in the background I seriously think one of them was sitting on the beach .This used to be a good company that provided great customer service but now you will find it difficult to understand one of their representatives never mind get a good service from them .Do not stress yourself out , avoid Vodafone and use a company that appreciates you .",0

Local mast broke in February. Peripatetic texts from Vodafone to say “we are working hard … blah blah blah” Then radio silence. It took 7 MONTHS for the mast to apparently be repaired and yet we still have no signal. Useless bot on website. Can’t talk to a human being. What am I paying for? I think I’m going to move to another supplier who might be better. It’s a shame as Vodafone used to be great.,0

"I am extremely disappointed with Vodafone's broadband service and customer support. We were promised Pro II Fibre 2 for £30 per month with a download speed of 60 Mbps, but now the only speed available in our flat is up to 25 Mbps, while the other nine flats in the building receive speeds of up to 74 Mbps. To make matters worse, we are being charged £36 per month instead of the agreed price. This is a blatant failure to deliver on the terms of the agreement.The customer service experience has been appalling. The chat support was an absolute failure—inefficient, unhelpful, and a total waste of time. From agents to managers, every person I spoke to lied, dodged responsibility, and offered no real solutions. Despite repeated attempts to resolve these issues, there has been no improvement, and it is clear that our concerns are not being taken seriously.What makes it even worse is that Vodafone is quick to enforce their company policies when it comes to overcharging customers, but they completely fail to keep their end of the bargain. This experience has been nothing but frustrating and demonstrates a total disregard for customer needs.Vodafone has shown a complete lack of professionalism, honesty, and accountability. I expected better from such a large company, but this has been disheartening. I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on this experience. They need to urgently address these issues and honour the promises made to their customers.",0
Let me start by saying this.... if it was possible to give minus 10* rating I would. I wouldn't recommend vodafone to my worst enemy. The customer service is shit.... the vodafone provider is shit. I've made well over 20 calls in two years regarding there service. I've had to have 3 new boosters I've had to switch the router on and off pretty much every few days. I've had to fully reset the router lost count on that. I'm so happy my contract has ended I'm now going to take the router and the boosters and take a hammer to them and once I've done that I'll set them on fire and then I'll piss on them. I think after that I'll be happy.... VODAFONE STICK YA SHIT BROADBAND UP YOUR ARSE YOU USELESS C**TS. KIND REGARDSJay smith 🖕,0
"On Monday 21 October, Vodafone said that after 24 to 48 hours, the telephone number (used for over ten years) would be transferred to their network at a much better rate. On Wednesday 23 October 2024, the telephone line transferred to the Vodafone network and stopped working. To this day (9 November 2024), there still isn’t any connection. My partner and I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone with them. Each time, we are told by various agents (Sarah, Mo, Emma, and so many others) to wait 24-48 hours. Now we have to add a 24-hour wait to speak to a manager when it was previously instant. We requested the PAC code to switch networks on 1 November 2024. To date, we do not have the PAC code for the line (even though Ofcom say it should be provided within a maximum of two hours after the end of the call). We asked for a letter of deadlock to report them to Cisas. They refused to provide one.UPDATE: Yesterday, Vodafone said the deadline to recreate the line on the account was 8 November. The line still does not have access to the network. Vodafone said the manager of Emma (our case handler) would call and speak to us within 24 hours. When we called back (since we never received the call) the agent said a manager tried to call at 16:30. That call was never received to date. They have still denied the PAC code and the deadlock letter.From one customer to another, it's not worth the stress of the ordeal. The potential savings are not worth the risk of losing your number (potentially forever). Compensation of a minimum of £9.76 a day (search: automatic compensation Ofcom) is inadequate. Not accessing health services for you and your family. Missing personal calls. Not speaking to family and friends. Missing business calls, especially if you are self-employed. All in the hopes that the line will be re-established in the ever-elusive 24-48 hours is just not worth it.We also noted that the broadband connection constantly fails in the middle of the night for about an hour, sometimes longer. The sales representative said it’s because they fix network issues at night. So, if you like a 24-hour broadband connection, look somewhere else.Reply to pending Vodafone response: I have spoken to the Vodafone team on numerous occasions (complaint 122386655). I have no interest in another conversation on Facebook, X or anywhere else. I have, of course, called and texted for the PAC code for the line, which has been continuously denied. I also, of course, reached out to the complaints team for the letter, which was denied. Please take note, everyone – this is how they pass you around like a hot potato, hoping you’ll just give up.",0
Spent way too long trying to cancel something simple. Paid my bill and they still sent Ardent credit services after me. Scam company,0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went into the shop and bought 24 month contract for sim only and broadband. After almost a week I wasn’t connected properly to my phone contract and I spent about 7 hours on the phone with the most useless tech support, every day telling me it will be within 24 hrs. Never shall I grace their door again.",0
"Switched to Vodafone with BIG regrets. My City Fibre engineers inspected my installation to check for faults and concluded that the reason for not getting my contracted speeds was down to a faulty router which they reported back to Vodafone. They will not send out a replacement and all communications have hit a brick wall. Vodafone are in breach of their contract but dont want to know. So payments halted. Avoid !Following their reply below, i have since installation date communicated with the store, Arte robot, various expert agents, personal managers and Twitter and have a stream of correspondants and open tickets all saying ""i will help and sort this for you, please stay connected"" when in fact every person i have engaged with apart from City Fibre who support my case, are designed to wear you down by putting up a breeze block wall and not help whatsoever. They wont listen to you or City Fibre when you simply need a replacement router! Complete Madness, Best way is to stop paying them but even that so far hasnt worked. Better still stay clear of Vodafone you will regret it.Ok so senior complaints involved now and a very polite lady called to say a new router is on its way and offered compensation. New router is worse than the original (kind of expected) but now Advisors say case is closed.The penny dropped. The router i have is not faulty but simply not fit for pupose. It will never reach the contracted speeds that City Fibre advise. The idea is you are forced to upgrade and pay more but even then if i thought it would work i am sure it wouldnt with faith lost in Vodafone. Glad i didnt buy the alltogether mobile phones as well! Refused to pay anymore and asked to be released from contract.",0

"Vodaphone experience over a 5 hour period....  If I could give them zero stars I would. Original aim was to purchase a Broadband deal, then change two mobile contracts to Vodaphone too. However, I will not be using Vodaphone for Broadband or as a Mobile Phone Provider, or recommend them.1. 10:00 hrs start: Website on 4 x attempts [over 1 hr] would not accept my broadband order.2. Website directed me to sales team phone number. Took me 15 mins to connect to team. Sales told me website doesn't work anyway. Spent another 30 mins giving same details to operator. Operator then told me that an order could not be placed because my current provider would not switch without me actioning the switch myself. When website states switch process is 'hassle free, done by Vodaphone.3. I contacted my current provider [5 minute call] who said Vodaphone had informed them of switch which was already in progress.4. Approx 12:00hrs:  I was now very frustrated. I contacted Vodaphone again via chat to confirm no order had been submitted via website or phone. Requested confirmation no order had been place, and no action would be taken to progress an order. Note that since approx 11:00 hrs I had received 5 text messages from Vodaphone telling me a date for installation.5. Operator on chat very unhelpful. Said order had been placed for my address, but would not cancel order, or give me order number.6. On my request, chat directed me to a complaints link on a web page with a phone number. The automated messages do not allow you to speak to anyone without an order number. I had placed no order, received no emails, and text messages just redirected me to same website link.7. I phoned my current provider, [Talk Talk] where I spoke to a real person, who was very understanding and contacted Vodaphone themselves, and then connected me to the Vodaphone complaints department who then wanted to run through a new order. By this time an email from Vodaphone had landed with a Web reference number.8. The only person 5 hours later, in Vodaphone Technical Team was Jamil who was professional and courteous, who confirmed he had cancelled the order whilst I was speaking. But, was unable to confirm his action via email with me. I took his word for it. Silly me!9. 36 hour later I then receive a text to say a direct debit has been set up with Vodaphone.So, figuratively speaking I have lost the will to live with Vodaphone. Awful, unco-ordinated web content, sales and complaints departments, left hand to right hand don't know what they are doing and there is no efficient responsive human complaints department.Outcome... I have stayed with my current provider Talk Talk, who kindly offered me a free Firestick for the hassle another provider caused as by the 5 hour mark I was in tears with frustration about Vodaphone.",0
The data is very slow and they sold me a faulty tablet that they refused to fix very poor customer service. On the clue they have no idea what they are doing and just as clueless in store to.,0
"Appalling service. Ordered broadband for our new property to ensure we could still WFH. Never arrived they had cancelled our order, but didn't know why! After 1.5hrs reordered increased price for same package and gave a further 3wk lead time. Following day, cancelled again, 2hrs on phone advised the previous owner had been with Vodafone and they couldn't accept our order until her line was disconnected and then we could order and go back on 3wk waiting list!!!!!",0

"I stayed with Vodafone for as long as I could. During the last three years I have had multiple problems with WIFI coverage in my house despite being promised by Vodafone WIFI experts that the problem had been resolved. I spent hours of my time chatting via the chatbot who I eventually felt I knew personally. Boosters were the answer, and so i ordered three. Only to find that boosters were not the answer and the problems continued. Boosters in the wrong position was the next explanation, wrong again. After repositioning all the boosters, unplugging, plugging back in, pressing the reset button (don't forget to have a pin handy) hold the WPS button on the router for three seconds, stand on one leg and all good. Not this time, the problems returned. OK try unplugging all the boosters, bring them close to the router, plug them all in (if you are lucky enough to have enough plug sockets) press the reset button for three seconds and the WPS button for three seconds on the router, repeat for each booster then leave to settle. Bingo, you are good to go and by the way you will never have WIFI coverage issues again. Next day, same issue. Patience is wearing thin now so please can we sort this or I am cancelling. OK one last try we can see the problem lies with the router so we will send you a new one. Sure enough a new router was left on the doorstep. What now? well just set up the new router and away you go. Back onto my friend chatbot who again asked me for all my personal details, I was quite upset as I thought he would remember me. Anyway he talked me through the set up and explained it would take a few hours for the booster to pair with the new router. No such luck. So finally I called to cancel the contract only to be told that it would take a month to complete. I said fine I'm unplugging the router and boxing up the boosters so please cancel from today. One month later I received a do not reply email asking for my outstanding months payment for the service that was not working. Back to Chatbot who put me through to billing dept. Very sorry to hear you are leaving and we completely understand your reasons but rules are rules and you do indeed owe a final months payment for a service we did/could not provide. Oh and for good measure if you don't cough up we will give you a bad credit rating and you will never be given any sort of finance again. So pay up and shut up seems to be the strap line. Good bye and good riddance Vodafone.",0
"If you click start chat on cancel order page , takes you to gaming site.Ha, I love the response, I, a customer can use my time contact another person at Vodaphone, but this department in Vodaphone will do bugger all. AMAZING. This reply certainly justifies my 1 star",0
Installation due today. No router delivered and no explanation or apology from company. No human contact - complete silence. I wonder whether this company actually exists. Lesson of this is to avoid Vodafone at all costs. Appalling service I regret coming across this company. But interestingly it’s service in European jurisdictions appears to be more credible and efficient. It does not communicate in UK.,0
"Network connection has repeatedly failed on a new account.  Support staff are polite and can see the problem, but dont seem to be able to fix it.  Three weeks on a new contract and still a non functioning phone....",0

"Switched to Vodafone in May, called several times regarding the connection as it constantly drops out and buffers me and my partner both work from home so we need a broadband with good connectivity. Keep getting told to do something with the box to ‘troubleshoot’ it which doesn’t change the connection. Wont allow us to cancel without paying an exit fee even tho we are paying for a service we are not receiving. The ‘customer care’ team are not helpful and don’t allow you to speak to management or raise a complaint. Avoid.",0

"I have been a loyal customer for nearly 20 years. Renewed my contract via vodafone website. Website thought I was a new customer after I said I wasn't then set me up with a second airtime plan so now I am paying two airtime plans. I am four days, three chat calls, four phone calls and over 4 hours wasted with no resolution. Every customer service person is clueless. Still no resolution and they keep undoing each others work in trying to resolve this. Was first told it could take 2 hours to resolve, then 24 and latest call said 72 hours. All the time I am paying for two contracts and stuck on a pay as you go contract with no data. Absolutely dreadful service. Loyalty to this brand means nothing.",0

"Where do I start…I am exhausted! It has been over 2 months when I am trying to leave Vodafone and I am asking to be disconnected but no one can do it for me! It’s crazy!4/09/2024 I called Vodafone uk letting them know I am moving and I want to finish my contract. On the phone they said all is done and they will disconnect me on tie 04/10/2024 I have also received a confirmation email believing all is sorted.03/10 I have received text from Vodafone informing my plan will continue at £28 per month I was surprised and called the again asking why I have received a text. Lady in the phone said my cancellation been cancelled and they will deal with it immediately and will disconnect me in 24-48h. She apologised and said it will never happen again. I believed this time I am being disconnected for sure as mistakes might happen but surely now they will deal with it.03/11/2024 I have received a text from V with information I have 2 outstanding bills-£73!!! It was Sunday morning I called V and I was not happy!!! I have said how is this even possible if I called 2 months ago and they still generate the bill! I have been informed my cancellation has been cancelled AGAIN!!! I demanded to speak to manager, been told I will receive a call in 24h it did not happen! So I called them on Monday explaining for the 4th time I want to be disconnected as I called 2 months ago and no one deals with my request and I don’t know who I can talk to. They finally transferred me to manager. All I can say useless!!! She did not know why I am still their customer but she transferred me to tech department saying “make sure they disconnect you” pardon me ?? “ you make sure it’s all sorted as you are a manager!!!” After spending 1h on the phone someone finally said all will be done in 48h please call us to make sure disconnection has been processed. I called on Wednesday 6/11/24 guess what they are still charging me and supplying (where I don’t even live at the address) cos there was a system error and I am not disconnected!!!! So for the 6th time I had to explain and repeat myself what’s going on spend on the phone over 1h was on the hold for good 45 min during the whole call. The person who served me said “you will be disconnected in 24 h you don’t have to call us again we will text you and send an email” guess what no email or text looks like will have to call them again tmrw! Waste of the time and customer service really bad! Everyone is lying and repeating the same lines!! Can anyone advise me how to take it further cos my customer’s right are breached and I feel like I am a hostage of Vodafone!!!!",0
"I wouldn't give it any stars if it were an option. The worst company ever! It was my biggest mistake to take the contract again with them. Since upgrading to Full Fibre 2 in May, I have unresolved broadband issues. The connection frequently drops, and the speeds are too slow for me to work or for my children to complete their homework.I have spent a significant amount of time on calls with Vodafone customer service, explaining the problem repeatedly and following all suggested troubleshooting steps. Despite the time and energy I’ve invested, the issue remains unresolved, and the promised service quality has not been delivered. I asked for a cancellation, and they want to charge me £100s for early exit.",0
"I have been a customer of Vodafone UK for over 20 years and I never missed one payment yet ,despite a decent credit report , I have been refused credit for a new device without reasonable explanation . Whatever system they are using for their credit checks ,it is flawed , do not put yourself through the embarrassment of getting refused credit , go to a decent company that respects and appreciates their customers . Customer service from Vodafone has been non-existent throughout this process ,basically I am dealing with foreign call centres and people at these places are poorly trained and  do not understand English .",0
"The most poorly designed UX for an app i've ever come across.Live chat disconnects every 30 seconds. When it reconnects you're told that the chat has now ended and you have to start all over again.Consistent app-related issues (incredible for a tech company). I can't make payment within the app - whether new card or saved card - the loading button never actually follows through. Yet on the desktop site it works well.Abandoned payments should be a metric you guys are aware of - it tells me you aren't monitoring the UX of your app at all. You add on missed payment fees with a ""friendly reminder that paying on our app is quick and easy"". It isn't.Customer service ""you can avoid these issues by setting up a direct debit""...okay, but it shouldn't be necessary: frictionless mobile payments is an incredibly basic requirements in 2024.",0
Over an hour on chat with a useless bot and then an agent who appeared unable to do anything except ask the same questions over and over.,0
Started the Switch 20th September its now the 7th November and still no service. They are unable to do anything about it or give me an installation date or any idea when the work will be carried out. Basically totally ineffectual.12/11/24 Estimated date is now 3rd Dec and I don't think it's going to happen then either.,0
Worst experience ever.. the way Vodafone treats there customers is very sick they send workers to people's houses who leave live hanging out the wall And they send workers that talk about drugs... When you complain about it and tell Vodafone that you lost food due to having to turn off the power in the house because of the live wire they force you and your family to eat out of bins till they want to sort it I would stay away from this company or your be next been caught in Vodafones trap they are unprofessional and they make me sick,0
Terrible. Vodafone operate a scam. I signed up to Vodafone Broadband and was meant to receive a £105 Giftcloud gift card. Not received. Giftcloud say it is for Vodafone to sort. Vodafone say it’s for Giftcloud to sort. Looking at Forums it seems this is a regular problem with consumers losing out and receiving nothing. I feel like I’m stuck in a Kafka novel 🙁☹️,0
"Their broadband is absolutely useless.Wifi signal drops for a year now. Made several report on it. They call they said :"" I assure you its fixed ""3 days past ans its back to normal. Only once they sent open reach engineer amd she said to her it look like a faulty router which agents denied multiple times after me sugesting what open reach siad. They sent me sigmnal booster which does nothing and supposed to call back after few days...guess what? Internet still drops out and no one cares. Im just waiting until my contract ends and will go for other provider.P.s. whoever designed they broadband test&diagnostic need to rethink if they are right person for the job.Once my internet drops out Im going to Vodafone broadband app to do the service check. I have to go through security check to actually test my Internet- by the time I do security check, they send me code and I choose broadband- Internet is restored so there is no issue.Vodafone do better!!!!",0
Terrible phone call customer services.  My contract is due to end. All I wanted to do was renew and see what money I could save with new contract. Since i being with vodafone since 2010 . Its 3 days later of trying to deal with customer services.  So now i have to use my dinner break to go to the local shop.. Why can't no one speak plan English.  I will be moving company.,0
if you are on a pay as you go plan and run out of data and want a different its worse than pulling teeth best you can find on google is to opt out of current one but no way to buy anorther one if you want to buy anorther one nope needs a new number you can order and finding a number to talk to someone is like pulling teeth ill be leaving,0
they are rubbish no signal in 2024 what a joke,0
No back up when needed.  I moved broadband to Vodafone and Openreach came to install cables.  The first engineers didn't do a good job and cable broke on the second day with internet not working.  Another team was called.  The internet is working but the cable was dug up .... maybe by foxes and loops upwards in the front garden instead of being attached along the garden wall as discussed.  Trying to get anyone to organise has been impossible.  The sales team were great when it came to selling the product but don't trust the backup - behind the scenes is abysmal.,0
"Vodafone didn't give me the service paid for, horrible reception, no ended calls, messages, don't make it easy to change for another product to keep the client and is still charging me a fine for a service that doesn't work. Anyways, after procedures, tests, changing devices and blablabla nothing worked.  Since July having trouble. they don't have access to the reference chats, the tests that they have done, the investigation that they did, nothing! But I have the chat copy, so feel free to ask me and I will show you. So if you are reading this, go for BT, O2 or other provider that will give you a good service for what you are paying for. Bad experience and now taking VOdafone to the court.",0
"I noticed I was being charged quite a lot for my Vodafone bill. I decided to check this out, and discovered I was still paying for my previous contract for the past year.I contacted Vodafone regarding this, and they explained that once the contract ends you move onto a rolling contract which I wasn’t notified about as all information was sent to my old phone number, which had been inactive since around the time my contract ended.The colleague I spoke to understood my point of view and tried to help me. I explained that I would be satisfied with even half of the money returned to me (around £350). He then told me he would cancel the contract and to ring back in 30 days to see if a reimbursement is possible.Fast forward 30 days, after a nearly 1 hour phone call I was told it still hadn’t been ended and I’d need to wait 7 - 10 working days (after already waiting 30.)Just after a week later; I followed up on a missed call from Vodafone. To my dismay, I was offered £50 compensation. This is offensive considering it’s not even 10% of the money that has been taken out of my bank for a phone I wasn’t using.Also, being a loyal customer to Vodafone it was disappointing to say the least. I’ve asked for this case to be escalated since the last person I spoke with didn’t do it. The customer service has been substandard and I am hesitant to bring a customer of Vodafone again.If a satisfactory resolution is met I’ll be happy to alter my review and stance on this company.",0
"I wrote a review yesterday about Vodafone’s poor customer service. I received a reply asking me to contact them. The 2 websites given to me both said they didn’t exist and so I tried ringing the number I was given. This number didn’t recognise me or my number, said goodbye and hung up. It would seem Vodafone cannot even operate their own customer service when you act on their instructions",0
"Appalling communicationI cancelled my account, some of the worst policies out there when it comes to cancellation.",0
"Ordered broadband. Received a call the next day there was a problem with the order, they needed to cancel it. Just redo the order. Did everything, got all emails and text notifications. Then no one shows up for installation.Ask customer services- they respond that it was cancelled because the order didn't go through. What does this mean? They don't know I should call another department. Honestly absolutely shocking won't be ever using them for broadband. What a joke",0
"Very disappointed about the customer service we received in our local vodaphone store earlier this week ,As an individual who works in retail management and knows about good quality costumer service I was shocked at the way we were dealt with ,We were going into vodaphone as we needed some help with leaving the company because we’ve had nothing but bad service throughout our 7 years with them , when we explained our situation to the staff he just shrugged it off saying there’s nothing I can do , completely understand if this isn’t something you provide in store anymore however abit of help would’ve been nice to explain to us how we go about doing it , considering there were 5 staff members in the shop all sat there doing nothing I was shocked no one came forward and offered some advice on how to leave the contract however they were clearly to busy on their phonesI hope there is some training given to these staff members to understand basic customer service or even just taught how to smile at customers ,I am glad I’ve left my phone contract from here and I know I will not be the only one leaving after this :)",0
"I've been with them since August 2023 and this is the third major bad experience of their customer service. I'm reasonably tech savvy and I've had wifi issues with their hubs and extenders before. To be fair things have been going OK for in the past three months. Today all I wanted was to be able get get their ""award winning broadband app"" to connect to the hub. Instead, as a result of speaking to 2 VF reps, I spent spending nearly two hours on the phone whilst my wifi was down between 2.30 and 7.30 pm.  In addition they simply cannot keep a promise on calling me back. The first time I was told to expect someone to call me back within mins 10 mins but no one got back after an hour, within 10-20 mins and waited 36 mins (ok, thats not so bad) and was told to expect a call within an hour and am still waiting (its now 21.15 they should have got back by 19.35 and the lines will be closed!) This is crap customer service!",0
I would advise everybody never ever go to Vodafone worst provider I’ve ever been with with home broadband no internet for 3 days was on the phone continuously and the customer service team kept hanging up on me so I decided to go somewhere else instead after 5 years of hell I’m feel like I’ve been released from prison,0
Absolutely garbage service I can't get through they want 575 for a service I'm not receiving I want the fee waived,0
The worst boardband company the internet just stops all of a. Sudden then you cal up Customer service most of the time they don't no what's going on you have to repeat your self a 100 times and then they make you wait for 20min then again they ask what can I help with. Not acceptable behaviour from a big company like Vodafone,0
"Ordered apple warch ultra 2 and Apple iPhone 16 pro max with 1 tb in black titanium. Ordered it on 30th of September which suggested it would take 3-4 weeks. And i was okay with that. Now it has been over 5 weeks, still no updates. When you try to reach out to the team the answer remain the same that they have stock issue and they are just provider and it depends on the apple itself to deliver the stocks. My question is, if you have stock issues why you have made available those devices and states the timeline of the delivery? Why do you perform hard search on any individual with this level of confusions that you have within your company. Now you have performed hard search and it will stay on my file for next six months or more. And you will say just sorry if I cancel the order. This should not be like this. You realise the seriousness of these credit searches right?Guys anyone reading this, please stay away from these clowns, and do not go with positive comments, those are likely to be paid ones. One of the worst service provider. No transparency at all.",0

"My web order number is WEB-0001000040598605. Joined with a SIM only deal on the 7th of October. What a big mistakeI I can't make outgoing calls because the Wifi Calling isn't stable, and when making an outbound call, it takes around 30 seconds or more to connect. I should've learned my lesson from a few years back, when I ended up having to pay this company £2K for two rubbish contracts. What Vodafone also don't tell you is that the majority of their shops are franchises, by this I mean that someone moves into an empty shop, gets phones from Vodafone, puts their branding around the shop, and the Vodafone name above the door, but doesn't have a vested interest in customer service, or anything to do with selling devices. Also, when you decide to end your contract early, by way of a PAC or STAC code, you get a text from Vodafone, saying that ""your early termination fee is £x"", it doesn't tell you how this is worked out, or if it's VAT exempt, or when, and if VAT will be added at all, or when the final bill is produced, which in my opinion, is just a backhanded way of legally robbing customers of their cash.",0
"So Vodafone here we are again. I thought we had gone our separate ways but like an ex that can't let go you spring up in the corner of the bar I frequent with my pals. I've moved on Vodafone, I'm in a new and exciting relationship with plusnet. I think you should move on too instead of sending me a letter claiming I owe you a month like an ex wife trying to claim csa and draw the last bit of blood I have. I have a settlement agreement from you stating you were rubbish and didn't treat me right and that we can part ways. So much so it's actually you that owes me a month. I've packed my stuff Vodafone and I've gone. It's time for you to find someone else. I wish you all the best but I'm happy with plusnet.",0
"Work with onecom to scam small businesses.They sell Sim only contracts at £123 a month through Onecom, they don’t have sim only contracts that are that expensive on their own websites, so I’m not sure what that extra money is for…except for making as much profit as possible.They have this really ridiculous system where they sell you a cheaper contract which Vodafone charges you for, and onecom refunds the difference but what they mis-sell you on is that it’s a 3 year contract ( or whatever length it is) but they only give you the refund for 17 months and it’s up to you, the customer to be aware of this, remember, and ring them to say you’d like them to continue the discount. But at no point are you told this is what must happen.We weren’t given a cooling off period as we were a business even though we explained the sims were unusable due to no signal; instead of fixing the issue we were sent a dongle which was meant to be a gesture of goodwill, instead we were charged for the dongle and another SIM card to use in the dongle.We get invoices from Vodafone each month and yet you’re unable to contact them as they state you have no contract with them.It’s disgusting, they’ve ruined my business and my mental health",0
I'm leaving a Negative feedback as my boardband Contract has just ended with no Communication and a bill saying we are charging you this this month as I'm out of Contract . I'm applying to Virgin now . Cheaper by far  . You don't just charge someone a higher price without Communication . . I'll also be leaving Vodafone mobile due to this been with ya for 5 years . It's a f u and bye,0
"Placed a Broadband Order, Got Confirmation for install this Friday(Order Placed 2 Weeks ago). tried to track delivery of Router but was told that the order was cancelled and they didn't know why. Useless customer service and next available date of install is 19 November, won't do that now as they might mysteriously cancel it",0
"My contract was coming to an end and I was advised to have a 3 month sim then visit the store after Christmas for a better deal. When Covid came and lockdown I tried to deal with this online. I had been a customer for about 20 years and wanted to stay. Vodafone would only offer a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford and I mentioned 02 were offering a 3 year deal. I was told if I wasn’t happy I should go to O2 then. My phone wasn’t working properly and I wanted to keep my number and  being a pensioner and disabled I needed a working phone. I told Vodafone I was leaving but again they weren’t helpful so I got a phone from O2. Vodafone said they weren’t informed and charged me for a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford to pay. In spite of several letters, emails and phone calls Vodafone couldn’t have cared less. Only interested in making money, very poor customer service. I could only do so much, I couldn’t go to the store for help because of lockdown so what more could I have done? I now need a loan to get my roof fixed as I’ve got water coming in and I’m losing my winter fuel allowance. I can’t get a loan as I have this so called ‘bad debt’ on my credit report . This is a very unfair way to treat a customer who didn’t even want to leave but was told to go. Vodafone need to look at how they treat customers.",0
I tried to top up my sim card in my wifi dongle. Although the transaction went through the credit did not go onto my sim in dongle. I ended up spending all morning on their website and their facebook page to resolve the issue. Their security is obstructive and discriminates against me as an autistic person. They insist it much be done by text. I cannot use a phone because I cannot cope with unpredictability of phone calls. I do not own a phone of any kind. It took several attempts to get them to provide another method of security.I use the wifi dongle to send emails to get help when I am out. it is essential for my safetyThey would not provide any means to directly complain so could make the complaint that I actually wanted to. The changed my complaint I made.All I want is when I top up for it to go directly onto the sim card. Vodafone and their customer service make it as difficult as possible.I had tried to top it up using one of the methods sugested on links. The credit did not go on my sim and it took all the next morning to get credit on my sim. I cannot top up via account (the other suggested method) I don't have a phone so I cannot recieve text messages to variefy the account. Again this is all very unhelpful. I don't use a phone because the unpredicatabily of phone call overwealms me often causing me to have autistic meltdowns. I use sim it dongle to send emails in an emergency. This is to keep me safe.,0
"I’m not one for reviews but i’d hate for others to waste precious minutes (or hours & days) on this earth dealing with vodafone’s customer service. I can give you brief summary of it now if you are considering their broadband. “We are very sorry and we will ensure we investigate this so that it does not ever happen again” then they do it again.The full & honest story behind my need to vent with a review -I placed an order for full fibre broadband. As agreed, the equipment shows up and on the day they say, great! but i noticed that there is no actual fibre modem in the property and i have no engineer booked. Odd but i give them a call to double check they’ve sent everything. Sure enough, there has been an understandable mistake - they tested the line to make sure the ONT (fibre connection) was active and working and sent out just the wifi hub. Between testing the line and the previous owner moving out though, the previous owner had disconnected the ONT and also sent that back which they weren’t supposes to. Frustrating but not vodafones fault and as my line isn’t going active for another few days, it’s no biggy, they’ll get someone out to fix it so it’s ready…wrong! They can’t raise it as a fault with city fibre as it’s not actually an active line yet.Pretty frustrating also but again, understandable i guess. The guy, who was really friendly say’s he’ll ring me back first thing on Monday when the line becomes active and get me a next day appointment. Sure enough he rings at 6pm that day as agreed but it turns out he can’t book an appointment with city fibre, he has to email them and they respond within 48hrs with an appointment within 48hrs of that.More frustration but ok, lets let it work itself out….8 days later and after calling literally daily, still no engineer, still no broadband, still no reason why as apparently people have been calling but i haven’t been answering! What had actually been happening is they were calling my 13yr old daughters phone number while she was in school and her phone doesn’t accept calls. I’d never given them that number regarding my broadband or phone number order but because i have an account for her phone, that had became the default contact number… except it hadn’t when they were calling me back to say how sorry they were daily with the screen written apologies?Fast forward to a few more days later when i’ve taken two days off work for the engineers who were definitely going to show up but didn’t because they had no contact details for me and after all the confusion an out of hours city fibre rings my actual phone number and has me up and running in half an hour around two weeks after my activation.Now that was a really bumpy start and the £16 in compensation they offered me felt very generous for two weeks of feeling like i was harrassing them and two days off work (self employed) but in fairness the broadband was bulletproof. Great speeds up & down, no cutting out, no complaints at all.3 months in now and while i’m away on holiday i get a text to say my broadband is being cancelled and to call them if i want to keep it. Clearly a phishing scam i thought, they won’t catch me out though!…wrong! Today my broadband is being cut off, this review might not even make it to the internet if i don’t press send quick enough.After speaking to two customer service people, it turns out that “someone” has requested a broadband switch mistakenly and there’s nothing they can do about it. How unfortunate you might think, clearly he’s tried to find a better deal…nope.You can’t speak to customer services without confirming your full name, DOB, address, email and favourite dinner before they text you a one time passcode but any old person can apparently just request to swap your broadband.The other wonderful thing is they’re going to send me a bill for 15 months of the remaining contract for my troubles.You couldn’t make up how bad their customer care is, everybody is sorry and everybody is emailing other people to get answers but nobody ever does. It’s genuinely the worst customer service i’ve ever experienced by a big margin. I beg you, don’t use them. The product is great when it’s working but i promise it’s not worth the headache of trying to deal with their customer service if you have a problem it really isn’t and i’m not a “complainer”. I get there’s red tape, i get that there’s a process to follow but i can tell you hand on heart if there is a minor problem with the service you will regret ignoring this review and you’ll message me one day soon to say steve, you were right.**updated since vodafone have replied**What you can see below is what i would call “classic vodafone”. Zero ownership of an issue, it’s always a case of can you contact another team, who then contact another team and ultimately you have to chase everyone while getting nowhere. Beyond awful.",0
"In November 2023, I ordered broadband, received the kit, booked an installation date, and then... nothing. No contact from the provider on the scheduled Friday. I called them on Monday, only to be told my order had been canceled because they couldn't actually provide broadband in my area. I filed a complaint, but it didn’t get resolved.Then in April 2024, I received an email about possible compensation. After spending hours in chat, I was told I wasn’t eligible for compensation after all. Later, I was informed I could claim compensation, but only for a few days. They blamed it on an automated system sending out emails indiscriminately. Here’s the kicker: I was marked as an inactive user at the time, so either someone made a mistake, or the system has serious issues (Skynet vibes?).The irony? My neighbor in the terraced house next door has no problem ordering broadband, but every time I check for mine, it’s unavailable. After spending two more hours in chat, bouncing between departments, I got nowhere. My next step is OFCOM—at this point, Vodafone owes me around £2,000 in compensation.",0
"Twice in just 3 months , internet crashed . No connection. The customer service at the phone ask too many questions about identification, not just the account number and it takes long time at the phone saying the same thing over and over again before finally ( as I said from the beginning) an engineer is booked. The engineer is booked only for the outside service but as always it turns out to be a problem inside the house, so after the first 72 h , I need to wait other 72h to get a engineer to come home!!Not a reliable service!!!",0
"Well , I've just moved my home broadband to VodaFone and tonight I have had my first interaction were I'm trying to get support for logging into my account so I can set up the equipment. I wish I could give a zero. The outcome from support was I should try again later when I asked if I could make a complaint I was told it could take 20-30 mins did I still want to do that, when I said yes there response was I need to provide input every 3-5 mins I asked multiple time if the person was there and was finally reponded to. The operator has said they will make a complaint and someone MAY call me within 10 days but they could not provide any details or reference number to track my complaint. As my first interaction from a new supplier I am very less than impressed, I will try again later but if I still cant get the system working I'll be cancelling my contract in the 14 days allowed. Very poor performance and not good first impressions.",0
"Absolutely disgusted with Vodafone's treatment of us after placing an order to switch our broadband to them from another supplier.Following the initial confirmation email on October 12th I subsequently heard nothing back from them. When the scheduled the date for the installation passed I contacted them asking for an explanation and was told that I failed a credit check. This despite the fact that I have never been refused credit, that I have never been overdrawn or in debt, that I am not even asking for credit, and that i have been a vodafone broadband customer at my second home for the past 2 years. This was all the more annoying because they had not bothered to contact me in any way to inform me that the order had been rejected.Well Vodafone you have not only failed to gain another customer, you have lost one as well, because you can be absolutely sure that after this experience, when my contract at the second home expires I will be switching to another provider.",0
"Miserable, rude staff. 5 staff in the shop today all doing absolutely nothing but playing candy crush? Got passed onto a customer service phone number yet the guy on the phone said It could have been dealt with in store. Lazy. Unhelpful staff. Some real customer service training needs to be taken place in here and also maybe teach your staff how to smile? Terrible shop everytime we have come in - unfortunately it is our closest. Will be switching providers",0
"According to the Vodafone website, leaving customers would get the final bill within 30 days of the date of disconnection and refund, if any, would also be processed. After the said period, didn't received any bill or refund. Contacted Vodafone via their complaint page, received a call from their agent the next day and was asked a number of questions about personal details before the agent generated the final bill and sent it over. Was told that in order to get the refund, bank details were required. Gave the required details to the agent, though quite reluctantly, as those questions were very similar to those that your bank or police would alert you as being from a scammer. Anyway, got an email confirmation after a week saying that the refund had been processed and would reach my account in 3-5 days. A month passed, no refund. Contacted them via email and got a call back again asking the same set of questions. Didn't provide bank details this time and the agent just kept repeating that the details were required for arranging refund. Interestingly, at the beginning of every call they claimed that the call would be recorded, and I suppose from my previous communication with the other agent a month ago, there should be a record already, after all, they said the details were required for processing the refund. Now just as if the previous communication didn't exist, despite the confirmation email about the refund I received more than a month ago, I was asked the same set of questions for personal details. It's just ""surreal"". I gave up. They can keep my money, otherwise it's just like groundhog day.Response to Vodafone's social media team:Thanks for your response but I have no desire to answer the same set of questions again from someone seems to be from an offshore call centre. It also doesn't help that all of a sudden I received a scam test message from a +91 area code number, though it may have nothing to do with my recent experience.",0
"Went with them and ported my number over , previous provider gave me a better deal to stay and they were unable to give me a new PUK number making it impossible to leave them , I logged a complaint and then they cancelled my number and now I am unable to retreieve it even when I went into the shop with my ID as Ive been told to do for nothing , Very unhelpful never ever go with them",0
"Very bad experience. You actually pay for a 5G plan, but they provide speeds below 4G. When you try to cancel contract due to their poor network, they pass you from one agent to another and won’t allow cancellation unless you pay for penalties. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!",0
Waited in all day for my broadband installation. Received a message from vodaphone yesterday confirming an engineer would be here today. I was finally told it wasn’t being installed today after I phoned to see where the engineer was. Lack of communication between both Vodafone and the engineers (City fibre). I’ve cancelled and also lost a days work in the process. Annoyed is an understatement.,0
"Could not add my current number on a new contract , from 21/10/24 I was to have my number ported on new contract for 12 months but what I got was lost mobile number £12 charge no contract , I had to get payasugo sim from another network from 21/10/24 and my credit score lowered as well , complete useless in the end they just said can’t port your number and disconnect the contract line and charged me £12 for there mistakes",0

if i could give no stars i would.

No special offers just bills climbing up, when I asked for better rates answers was that I’m still on a contract nothing can be changedI think it’s time to change providers",0

"Awful! Don't even bother visiting. It needs shutting down. No staff, no customer service.Wasted my Saturday afternoon driving 45 mins there, 45mins back as it is the closest one to me, paid for parking and walked to the shop. All I wanted to do is return my old broadband dongle which vodafone told me to do since upgrading my broadband with them or they would charge me £40 if not done within 30days.no option to post this which I think is terrible but that's another story. When arrived the guy on the front deskbwith glasses on said if I take a seat they would be with me 10-20mins. They literally left me sat in a corner of the shop for nearly two hours. An Asian guy to be fair was seeing to a customer and was doing his job. The white guy with glasses on was sat chatting about park life festival and oasis gigs he's been to to another customer instead of delivering customer service. Coming up to 2 hours of waiting and could clearly see he was just chatting rubbish the full time I was in there I asked him can I leave the dongle with him as my parking ticket was running out. He said he can't as I have to be there with some IMEI number. I gave him this and then he started saying the system was down and I should go back another day when they're less busy!!!??? Absolutely awful. I work in customer service for British gas and there is no way this is an acceptable way to treat customers. He then told me to ring 191 when I was leaving. Don't worry pal I will be doing......and complaining about you and your awful service!!!just waiting for them to charge me £40 now for not returning the dongle which they have refused to take off me in store and given me no other way of returning it. If and when they do I will be reporting them to the FSA as I do wonder how many other customers are being charged these fees for not returning equipment they're unable to return due to Vodafone's terrible customer service. I suspect they're making a lot of money out of this and it needs investigating.",0
"I have the misfortune of having both my home broadband and mobile phone with Vodafone.Last Monday, 28th October 2024, I came home from work to find my WiFi wasn't working, so I went on and reported a fault- requesting an engineer to visit on Wednesday 30th. Said engineer decided not to bother showing up, incredibly frustrating since I'd taken time off work. That started a ridiculous chain of events featuring me contacting customer support and getting told a completely different story each time. First, on Wednesday, I was told that the supposed engineer had worked on the problem remotely and it would be fixed on Thursday. Then on Thursday I was told it was a network event and that it would be fixed latest on Friday.Then on Friday I was told that the engineer would need to come out to me and the earliest they could come would be Monday! That such blatant incompetence is allowed to exist is staggering to me. Additionally on Friday, I was at the office, but was told an advisor (Feddrik) would call me at 11.15 and could I head home. So I headed home only for this person not to call at all. I then contacted customer ""service"" back and was told to wait for a few hours and he would definitely call. I have better things to do than wait for him to call so I headed back to the office. He never called.Honestly, the contempt with which I've been treated is appalling and I honestly can't wait to take my business elsewhere.Well done Vodafone, you're so clever.",0
Signed up on the 10/10/24 for broadband and phone. Told router would be with me a few days before connection date on 30/10/24. Day before still nothing and after some looking found my router was being send back to Vodafone. Not communication about this so had to try to contact Vodafone. After over a hour of online chat windows someone from Vodafone confirmed it had been sent back and they would send another one out to be with me within 3 days…. 3 days have passed and no router. But I have been send a message saying my bill of £34 need paying on the 11/11/24. How can my 1st bill be ready after 12 days of when I should of been connected when on the evening of the 2/11/24 there is still no router?Also 30% of the reviews are 1* reviews.

"When roaming in the Philippenes, Vodafone charge £7.39 per day if your PLAN started after 11.8.2021, but only £6 per day if it started before that date.I have been with Vodafone since 9.8.2021, i.e. before the cut-off date but, because I changed my PLAN in 2023, they insist on charging me £7.39 per day instead of £6 per day !Is this unfair or what ?Surely the relevant date ought to be when you JOINED them ?So much for brand loyalty !I shall therefore probably be leaving them when my current contract expires.",0
I had a very bad experience with vodafone in Haywards Heath on the 1st of Nov. I went in there to check on an order which I thought was done on 31st Oct at Haywards heath branch. The Customer service at haywards said the order was not completed on 31st Oct. Then She said you have two options cancel the order and thats it or start over again(which I spend two hr with my pregnant wife on 31st oct at store). The way they treated us on 1st of Nov was not right as I think as a customer when you spend time for a product you really want to buy the company should also make sure that the customer for their product is treated well and not come back and say you need to cancel it and do nothing. Instead to get the order sorted out they just wanted to cancel it and finish it. If vodafone doesn’t want customers to purchase phones from their outlets don't advertise saying you have got offers and so on. If you think customers can be treated like this then you’re wrong.Have been using for Vodafone for long and I would say Burgess Hill Store is better that HH.,0
"My partner recently upgraded her phone and traded in her old phone as part of the deal.She was told that she could drop her old phone in to any Vodafone store for her trade in to be processed.She went in to basildon retail store today, only to be seen by a woman who was not interested at all.The advisor said that they don't recieve trade ins in store, and turned her away which was a inconvenience.This is very poor customer service from the advisor who showed very little interest in helping.",0
"Abysmal service from Vodafone. Cannot wait to be out of contract and I will never use this company again in my life. We suffered download speeds of less than 1MB for 12 days, not enough to even open an email. I spent countless hours on the phone with them. Waited at home on a working day for router that didn’t arrive. Eventually the service resumed, and despite loosing £100s in income due to not being able to work at home, spending over £200 on alternative internet solutions and in coffee shops so we could use the internet to work, they called to offer us compensation…..of £5. Absolute joke.",0

"Absolutely terrible experience - don't believe these ""easy peasy"" to switch adverts - more like ""difficult difficult""!! It was the most frustrating experience! When the engineers came to install my fibre they cut my previous cable and then were not able to install the new cable due to some kind of blockage (fair enough, not their fault). They promised it would be all sorted next day (I explained to them I work from home so I need the internet). Well, I call vodafone up in the morning because no one has turned up and I had no communication whatsoever as to what is going on, when I finally manage to get through to someone they say it will be UP TO 5 WORKING DAYS! I asked if there's any way this can be expedited as I work from home and I need the internet, but no luck! Customer service is a shambles - just a bunch of people reading from a script and not helpful AT ALL. In the end we ended up sorting it out ourselves with CityFibre themselves who were brilliant and got us up and running the next day! So it could have been expedited, just not by vodafone!They then offered me £20 for my 2 days of missed work which is just insulting. Even more insulting?! When they actually paid it it was only £18 ! After spending 2 days pretty much non-stop on the phone with vodafone and CityFibre, I can safely say if we didn't sort this out ourselves with CityFibre we would still be without internet and none the wiser as to what is going on as vodafone themselves are clueless.If you do want to go with vodafone, you want to pray nothing ever goes wrong because good luck getting it sorted!",0
"If you are thinking about setting up a contract with Vodaphone, think again. I had sim only deals for my kids, and at the end of the contract, the prices are hiked up. I was organised and tried to cancel but they have made it almost impossible to do so. If you ring and want to book a new deal, no queues, if you want to ring to cancel, about 30 minutes queues. But i persisted and waited in the queue. Eventually i got through, the chap said to NOT CANCEL MY DIRECT DEBIT as i was owed money back, then they contianued to take another 2 months charges, at the higher rate. So next time, i cancelled the direct debit, and they sent it to a debt colelctor claiming i didnt give them 2 months notice, again, no chance of getting through if you want to cancel. On top of that, you cant port a number from one Vodaphone account to another vodaphone account, so when I got a more competative quote on a comparison site from a third party using vodaphone, and tried to change numbers to that, it couldn't be done, so they charged me for those numbers as well whilst i cancelled!! So i have paid several hundred pounds over and beyond, and they still reckon I owe another £100+. Absolute daylight robbery. I wish I had time and patience to sue them, just thought a quick warning to others to figure out a better plan than me for when you are trying to exit!!! ** I have different numbers with them on different deals as we have 5 kids!!",0
"I put in an order on 9 Oct. Appointment with engineer booked for 28 Oct. Fine. Stayed home 1pm-6pm, engineer said he couldn't do everything on the day. Another visit from two more engineers two days later. Stayed at home, yet again, 1pm-6pm because who cares about job and life and etc., right? They installed everything and completed the job. Today, still no internet after endless (well, not endless, only ca. 50 mins each) chats and calls since yesterday. All one gets is a different person every time on the other end of the chat/call saying that they have marked it as priority and now I have to wait 30 mins... Frustrating. I'd rather someone said: look, we couldn't care less, wait a few days and we will try our best, or almost our best. Would they be alright with it if this was a client's approach to payments, for example? ""Oh, sure, I'd promised to pay my bill once a month but you know what, why don't you wait a few days...""-----Update after Vodafone's reply:I did call them again today. Twice, so far. Twice they said it was now all sorted and I had to wait 30-50 mins top. I still don't have internet.Update 03/11/2024Vodafone are absolutely worthless. they were unable to resolve the issues with connection outlined above, so I asked them to cancel the order. initially they refused and quoted their own internal policies as a guide. only when I explained the law allows me to cancel the contract they agreed. this was yesterday. today I woke up to a email from Vodafone with a bill for £26. it is beyond me how they can issues a bill for a service they did not provide. I have now ben connected on the chat for the last 3 hours, I have been transferred 5 times and every persons acknowledged that the service was never delivered by Vodafone but were unable to cancel the bill. I asked for the complaints team contact details and again was refused the information. now I am chatting to 'mamager' who also refuses to give me complaints team details and advises he will raise a complaint (as if I was unable to do it myself) and the team will contact me within 7 to 10 days. this will mean that I will go over the due date for the bill. I explained this to the 'manager' and asked them to flag it as urgent and for someone to call me. all I got was we don't use phone, you contact us back in 72hrs. absolutely disgusting behaviour from Vodafone. explaining customers to take time of their work/life to be contacting them to rectify a mistake they made. I will be contacting the consumer ombudsman tomorrow morning and making an official complaint and submit a request for 'compensation for distress and inconvenience'.",0
Set up wrong address for broadband even though through 3 calls due to delays in set ups I kept confirming my address they never flagged up it was incorrect. Due to the incorrect address couldn't do installation so then had to cancel and set a new order.Their compensation was to refund me if I am billed for the several weeks missed service. I said I couldn't be billed for that time anyway as there error and I had no way to confirm as the precontract doesn't have address on it.The new one the house doesn't have fiber box so I can receive the service I paid for over 4 hours on phone to customer service;Wanted 3 things:1- My contract sent to me so I can access the app - not achieved in 4 hours call and several departments.2 - a date to confirm when engineer will be out to put fiber box - not achieved in 4 hours call and multiple departments3 - someone to trouble shoot the internet to be usable until fiber box installed through phone line - no achievedI've lost hours of wages during these calls and it was always a different departments fault. No accountability,0
"Shame there isn’t a zero star. Appalling customer service. Issues never resolved. They don’t seem to take responsibility for hardware issues. Been on the phone 6 hours in the last month. Repeated steps from 4 different representatives and still no resolution. Communication is atrocious. Quote “If we find a problem we will call you. If all is working we will just leave it”. That would be ok but it has never worked. So every 5 days give them a call to repeat what we’ve already gone through. They have seen it with their own eyes through the video chat but still no resolution. Basic level support reading from a manual in front of them. Be careful who you choose, but I will be leaving due to “not providing a service”",0
"I wanted to ensure my contract ending at the end of the month would be the same as cancelling my contract as I have found elsewhere at 3 times the speed for the same price for broadband... chatted with Ahmed.Completely inappropriate customer service... asking me what my weekend plans are, how I use my broadband, and these side smiley faces (like this :) ) which is simply unprofessional. How old is he? 12?I asked to cancel my contract and he gives a whole lot of sales pitch BS, so I asked again to please just deal with the matter at hand to no avail. Eventually he got the message after I had to be completely direct with him that I am closing my account, end of.Please train your customer services... it is just unnecessary to feel like I'm dealing with a teenager to get something done.",0
"I have been a customer of Voxi for 4 years. This is day 10 of the ongoing, unresolved issues with mine, my flatmates' and neighbours' Mobile Data with Vodafone/Voxi. I actually tried contacting Vodafone last week (don't attempt - they are useless). I've been in touch with Voxi's disappointing customer services on their website via chat, as well as on their complaints number (+44 808 005 7463 - they actually pick up, worth giving a call!) and have been promised to be contacted by a manager today, which did not happen. The Network Status Checker, so often brought up on here and on other sites and conversations, is useless - apparently, according to the checker, my street in Central London, King's Cross area should have a perfect Mobile Data connection. It's such a joke! I'm extremely dissappointed, frustrated and tired of this situation, but will not stop complaining everywhere I can until my issues have been resolved. Also, I keep being asked to do the same useless tasks over and over again: go to your Settings, restart Mobile Data, check APNs... Never helps, but I keep being bothered with the same instructions. Anyway, as I mentioned yesterday: DO NOT get Vodafone, do NOT get Voxi. You will regret.",0
"Vodaphone phoned me twice in the last ten minutes in spite of me being on the TPS (telesales preference service) which means I don’t want cold call telesales.Vodaphone is a horrible company and gave me useless service- I could never get a signal. When I complained and said I wanted to cancel the contract they said I’d have to pay to get out of it. I complained and eventually got some compensation but God knows how many important calls I missed, including from the hospital when I needed to go in emergency",0
The worst of the worst in every single way!!!!!,0
"Vodafone Broadband service absolutely useless. Broadband not working for last 3 days. Vodafone promised ,engineer will attend to fix the issue for last 3 days. I called vodafone customer care every day multiple times, no concrete response. No solution yet, Vodafone customer care is not proactive, customer care team don’t want to escalate, as if there are managers to listen to customers & customer care says managers can’t help to resolve issues. Vodafone customer care is utterly useless, not efficient, service is worst I have ever seen.",0
"I literally can’t think of a worst experience with a broadband team in my life.From the engineer texting me for two days that he would be at my flat so I had cancelled plans and working from home and him never turning up, to him finally showing and then not being able to install the router properly because there wasnt the correct wiring, to explaining this to vodafone and the employee getting angry at me for believing the engineer and wanting to cancel and then telling me I have to wait for the next day to cancel.The router is obviously in my house but was never even installed, never serviced, vodafone was supposed to send me a package with a return label to return the router in but never did - obviously because they just want more money. Before my bill, I contacted them worried as I hadn’t received the label or package and I didn’t want to be charged. They assured me I wouldn’t be and were confused themselves as to why they hadn’t sent the return material.Now I have been charged and Vodafone is trying to say it’s because they have been waiting for the router and they are charging me for it still being at mine - I only received a return label because of the guy I called last week who sent it me, they had never sent it before thatThey are money obsessed. This was such an awful experience and after days waiting around and hours of phone call conversations with awful employees. I would recommend avoiding.",0
"Customer service non existent.You’ve got 02, Three or EE network. Order a phone from Vodaphone at your peril.",0
The support they give is horrendous. All I want to do is connect a Dream Machine Pro to the ONT. I don't want to be locked into a rubbish router that I can't use for my network!! I would just stay away. I don't believe an actual network engineer works at this company.,0
I just bought a mobile WiFi router. Don't ever buy one.I am unable to set it up. The required password information is written with a load of other information in very small font (snoutb2point) in an area the size of a postage stamp (3 x 2cm)The card that this sticker is stuck to is about 6 x 8cm and the back is empty. Vodafone could print the password on the blank side on normal sized font (12pt) which would enable the mobile WiFi to be set up properly.I thought that I entered the password correctly but I haven't. I may have entered the wrong password (there are 2 with no explanation)I unable to retry the password as I can't find out how to do it in windows as there is no internet connection.I am angry because I can't read the passwords due to their very small size and I can't connect to the internet.I can't get a refund either because I have opened and used the router and SIM card.I will now have to take Vodafone to court as I believe that it is their fault as the provided information is printed in a minuscule font.I bought the router from Argos.,0
"Thank you for your response and offer to look into the matter, that is good. You suggest I contact you on X, and other social media. Unfortunately I do not subscribe to any which is why asked that you contact me by email as mentioned in my earlier review. I would respectfully make it clear to prospective customers that you do not have email.",0
"I've been with Vodafone for 26 years but poor service and expensive and unfair practices on their part has made me leave. Attempting to get any advice before I left was appalling. I only had one question, yet I had to answer over 15 questions to even get the opportunity to ask mine. Then they couldn't answer and would not listen to my pleas for help with standard corporate ""computer says no"" responses. When I then left I got multiple calls from their sales team trying to win back my custom. If I contact them I get nothing. If they contact me to make money I get to talk to a human on the phone. The balance is all wrong. I will never return and would never encourage others to join. Truly awful and no attempt by them to hide it.",0
"Both me and my partner are both with Vodafone, have been for many years and have broadband with them too.I recently upgraded my phone, arranged to collect it from the Vodafone store in Crawley. Was passing the store the next day so popped in to see if it was there on the off chance. Guy who served me did the ID check etc but the phone wasn't there. Not a problem, got a text the next day to say it was there. Popped by to collect it. ID check was passed again and collected my new phone.Later that evening I dropped my old device in the dark and although I can see where it's gone I can't get to it. The next day was Saturday and we had to go and pick up a few bits in town and were passing a different Vodafone store so I went in to see if I could get a new sim. New sim was scanned etc, went through the iD check again, with the same bank card etc and it FAILED. The girl who served me said it could be a problem with the system so she tried another computer and it failed AGAIN. She then said I couldn't get a sim card because you  can't try the ID Check again a third time I'd have to leave it 24 hours even though ALL my details matched including my Vodafone log in, card details account number, address etc etc she still couldn't give me a sim because I might be using a cloned card!!She then suggested I call customer service to order a sim and they can send me one, great advice when I don't have a sim card, how exactly was I meant to make a call? My partner had gone off to pick up some other bits in town and we aren't always together. The signal isn't great where we live so making calls can be difficult as you get cut off. The broadband works fine from the landline.She reluctantly called them for me on a shop mobile, and even though I passed all the security checks on the phone she still couldn't give me a sim and I had to wait for one to.be sent.In this time I couldn't set up every day apps like mobile banking etc and most things need text verification now to make them work. I don't have a local branch and can't access my accounts, even logging in via the website needs text verification! My Dad was overseas, so if he needed me and I wasn't within wifi he couldn't call, if I had car accident or any accident I could call. It makes you realize how much we rely on our phones.My new sim has arrived and I'm still waiting for it to get activated. Tried to activate it online but you have to.log in on the Vodafone website and you need text verification!! Made contact finally via Tobi after going round in circles I have now now been without a network for a week which might not sound like much but it's the inconvenience of not being able to make contact with anyone until I reach Wifi. I feel completely let down by Vodafone, and if I hadn't just upgraded my phone I'd be switching networks. I would ring them to complain but I can't!!",0
"Had to call a mate in Australia this morning (he'd messaged me to tell me that his young son had died suddently) and after a 35 minute call Vodafone presented me with a bill for £108 and locked my phone informing me that I had to pay the out of plan charges immediatelyCalled 191, got put on some silent hold thing. Called back, had no option but to pay £108 over the phone in order to be able to continue to use my phone.My experience -07:19 - Call to Australia started07:53 - Call ended (34 minutes)08:03 - Text message from Vodafone alerting me that I had spent over £1 on international calls08:05 - Text message from Vodafone alerting me that I had spent over £50 on international calls08:31 - Message from Vodafone alerting me that my monthly spend is unusually high08:32 - Message from Vodafone informing me that they have turned off my calls and dataText from Vodafone and that I need to call Vodafone08:40 - accessed account online and tried to resolve with the useless chatbot08:55 - called 191 and was informed I had to pay £108 out of plan charges immediately to be able to use my phoneI have been a vodafone customer for over 20 years across three continents, I do not wish to continue doing business with a company which functions in this way. Sadly my contact has 12 months to run.Very unhappy with Vodafone!!Edited at 13.38 in response to Vodafone reply.Dear Vodafone responder (AI??)If you'd checked your records you would have found that I had paid the off plan charges (£108 for a 35minutes call) before I wrote the main review. I had to, I needed to use my phone.Actions speak volumes and words are cheap. Your response has only made me more determined to end all dealings with Vodafone as soon as my current contract expires.",0
"I placed my order for broadband but somehow it never arrived and on the day of installation, nobody came and when I asked customer service, they said my order was cancelled.After more discussions with customer service, they offered to help me sign up to another new plan, but would be more expensive than the one I originally had. Also could not get an earlier installation date after they missed my original date. Additionally, refused to provide any temporary solutions e.g. a mobile broadband to bridge the gap.Overall, extremely terrible for 1. Not honouring the order and not offering any explanations, 2. Not even trying to do anything to make up for it, 3. Leaving potential customers in a very inconvenient position",0
Was a customer with Vodafone for a number of years and just couldn't get out of my contract took a contract out with them and it was for £40 per month but when I got my first bill it was for £45 and it was in 2 parts 1 for phone and 1 for usage when I asked about this they said that this was the contract I'd taken out which wasn't and it stayed like this for a few months and they kepted messing up on taking payment for my phone and not line rental so I had to make a few months payment to catch up and a few months later I was paying over £50 a month and when questioned them about this they said it was to do with every April that it would rise I tried to cancel saying that they changed the contract that I took out but just got threatened with a huge bill so I was stuck paying this till the end of my contract which as now finally ended thank God but I'm still left paying for the phone which is around £250 for I iphone 13 which I pay £22 a month for which is totally useless as is a broken but at least I'm not in a contract with them no more so that's the end of the nightmare with them well hopefully 😀,0
"I'm Very disappointed with the broadband connection. I'm with Vodafone from June I was quite excited to jump from slow BT broadband in to super fast full fibre Vodafone...that's how was advertised everywhere. Unfortunately that was a mistake my BT broadband was slow but very stable with very low latency great for online gaming which I can't say about Vodafone broadband high latency and unstable connection. I've contacted the customer service to find out what is causing high latency on my broadband and after a few tests and checks there's no solution to this. After digging deeper I've done a few tests and trace route my connection and it looks like my connection is being routed through Vodafone's Scottish servers in Glasgow or Edinburgh. So my connection goes almost the length of the country across vodafone's network, before it even meets the internet. I live near London. And there's no solution for this...If you are looking for a smooth and low latency connection for online gaming definitely avoid Vodafone it's not a great option!",0
"I took out my Vodafone contract and it started out positive, the reception was decent in most places and I enjoy the chances to win stuff on the rewards. I had to go to Germany for work for 5 months and once in Germany I found out that my current contract was useless abroad so I took the hit and added the abroad features so I could still use my internet etc. the abroad charges are disgusting by the way. A month or 2 into my contract with the extra expense of abroad features I receive a text saying that I will no longer be covered as you are only allowed to use your phone for a few months out of England.so I’m now stuck with the added expense of the roaming but wasn’t able to use my phone. I make sure to tell everyone how bad Vodafone is and can’t wait to leave them and never return.",0
"Vodafone are fraudulent without doubt. After noticing my credit rating had gone down in points I checked why my online banking showed Vodafone as missed payments monthly from October 2024 going all the way back to 2018 with missed payment on each month. I have not had a Vodafone contract of any kind for years after opening one in 2009. Vodafone were ok but then it became a constant battle to prove they had make fraudulent amounts owing to renewal agreements that were not kept to. They then said I didn’t have the agreement I claimed. I had four phones one for me and one each for 3 children who I paid for but when they upgraded they had to pay any extra costs themselves as soon as they began part time work while at college. It was nothing but constantly challenging them over bills that were incorrect to changing upgrade agreements. Having to be on the phone hours and multiple visits to the store. I never thought to look deeply as to check for contracts I wouldn’t even have. I have had a few problems credit rating wise but to find out Vodafone had been behind it all theses years is diabolical! To speak to someone you need your account number to just pass the automated system alone. I had multiple tries at making up account numbers and phone numbers till eventually getting through after several days. Then obviously you can’t pass security! Nothing was showing because there was nothing to show . I wanted to speak to someone as they have always been sly and crafty I didn’t want to give them any opportunity to deny it all or changing anything on my old account like they did multiple times back then. Eventually I managed with the help of Muhammad who I will say was very helpful in trying so I could pass security.  Muhammad couldn’t find anything under my name and when on hold a i looked at my online banking credit check and it had been changed  TO PAID UNKNOWN  for October and September this this year how crafty again of them. I pointed this out but got no response. Then after being on hold again Muhammad informed me Vodafone had not affected my credit rating! OMG exactly why I wanted to speak to Vodafone and not giving them the opportunity to change anything to be able to deny it. Again I said that it wasn’t true Vodafone changing the last two months was sly and I had already taken screenshots and have proof of what was done telling Muhammad they wasn’t getting away it. He had first informed me they will correct it and be compensated for what they done that changed to a complete denial not accusing Muhammad of doing it but whoever he speaking did. Do not trust Vodafone this is typical of there conduct and sly crafty ways.Avoid like the plague unless you want high blood pressure, want to spend hours monthly on the phone getting fobbed of with rude people who don’t have to face you personally , want to battle proving they have taken money you don’t owe and I want a very stressful life involved in everything to do mobile phones.  Vodafone have no shame!!!!!  Ignore any reply from Vodafone about this it will be nothing but lies and there usual sorry you had this experience bla bla I will update after I have taken legal advice and it’s concluded.",0
"I have now been a Vodafone broadband customer for just over 2 weeks. In that time my broadband has been dropping out regularly. This never happened with my previous supplier. I have been in touch with their technical support team throughout and, although everyone I have spoken with has been friendly and has appeared helpful, the problem remains. I have spent hours on the phone and have also waited at home for promised call backs that didn’t happen. The matter is ongoing, but I have already made the decision to switch to a different supplier; in the hope of receiving a better standard of service.UPDATE - Vodafone have now admitted they cannot identify or resolve the problem with my broadband. Apparently sending out an engineer to take a look is not an option. So another week with unreliable broadband, that I have already paid for, before my switch. My case has now apparently been passed to the ‘resolutions’ team. Although I was promised an email confirming this, and including my case reference, that has not arrived !",0
"I have a problem with my home landline, which is part of a broadband package from Vodafone.  I was told an engineer needed to visit to fix the problem. I received emails and texts confirming the visit and also a warning that i would be charged if i was not at home to receive the engineer.The engineer failed to show, so i called Vodafone Customer Services.  They struggled to explain what had gone wrong, offered a very casual ""these things happen"" and declined to offer any compensation despite my having wasted an entire morning.  And the problem is still not fixed........",0
"I opted for vodaphone broadband in sept and a router arrived on 24 with fibre install due on 8th Oct , then I had a txt saying there was a delay but then I heard nothing, I've email and chatted only to be be cutoff I'm disgusted with Thier cust service.Finally got through to chat line only to get told I didn't have an order in so I sent web reg and was told the install date was lost so had to book another which can't help done till 1 nov as BT are involved, I've complained to Vodafone phone as I'm now on full price with previous provider.I will persist until I can get a date then access if I continue with this awful company",0
"Beware... This company sold me a contract for 2 years for a phone they told me they were the best coverage for the area I lived in.. Sadly it transpired my property had no coverage with this company, After returning the phone three times. Vodafone informed me I was ""in a contract for 2 years and that was the end of it"". I had no land line this was my only way of communicating with anyone . I spent 11 months knowing I could not call for any emergency service. I moved property . I am not a young person. I had to walk a busy duel track 3 miles for a signal.I came out of contract in September only to experience even more problems . They refused a Pac code  and lied once again.  I waited a further 4 days and a  a very rude exchange on the phone to end the contract, I wasn't even in.. Finally they are gone. No I cant recommend the company, or the service, and sadly no real people work at Vodafone. It is AI only...",0
"Avoid this company they overcharge you, threaten to impact your credit score and threaten to charge you a payment fee for services I don’t even have.I cancelled my broadband and gave 30 days notice as per my contract.

Chat staff disconnect you, transfer you and threaten you.Avoid this company and I shall take this ludicrous company further.Regards your reply which is just a generic reply to all complaints:I do not have either Facebook,X or instagram account. If Vodafone had told me this was the only way to resolve and issue u wouldn’t have joined them I the first place. What happened to a customer service phone number? Oh that’s right it comes down to cost saving from Vodafone. You are a joke of a company",0
I posted a review here earlier but it seems that no person was able respond and the troubles remain outstanding. The trouble is that Vodafone fails to offer email contact address to resolve problems. Thus once it had your bank details it ignores what you say and just latches on to milk your account.,0
"the connection speeds are great but the stability is awful, constant dropping out 3+ times a day customer support is useless and don't offer any help or compensation, worst internet provider i've ever been with.Not to mention their sim cards are just as horrific as their wifi constant dropping while out and about can't get a signal is most placesAvoid at all costs!",0
"Our internet is not always reliable. It goes out frequently weekly, but when it works it's fairly quick. Unfortunately the problem hasn't been resolved yet.",1
Poor customer service.Their fiber service isn't very reliable. Has issues that they won't admit to. And won't fix either.Plenty of issues either they want to roll a truck out to you but charge you if they find nothing or they want to replace your equipment when it's already been replaced twice.I won't give  them anything less because overall it's been tolerable at least in my situation. Unlike other companies I've dealt with that weee much worse. They at least have a small level of stability.But poor customer service and tech support is the reason I take the stars,1
"This should’ve been a one star, but Jerome ID # JW913Q Completely saved the day. For about 30 hours, I couldn’t use my work cell phone Because three different individuals in the customer service couldn’t figure out how to get my phone connected to the E-SIM. It took only 40 minutes and that is including me calling in and verifying my information so most likely around 20 minutes it took Jerome to fix the issue. If it had not been for him, I was getting ready to cancel everything.",1

"I was with another phone service for 3 years. I live in a very rural area and to make matters worse, it's in valley so service was sketchy and to add insult to injury, the rates kept going up.  About a year ago, I switched to AT&T and my service has improved 100%.  Customer service is always helpful and except for being gouge when I missed a payment, I have no complaints.  I'm on a fixed income so low cost is important but staying in contact with family and friends and being able to cal out in case of emergency is of utmost importance.  I'm sure glad I switched from Verizon to AT&T.",1

"I tried att air for seven day trial.  It worked fine initially-faster speed, easy set up and cheaper than my current plan. However, a major issue was noted that caused me to return the unit. Air runs off of cell towers that only provide “dynamic”ip addresses (meaning that the ip address changes every day). This caused my apps(Hulu live and Utube live) to change location every day.  Got locked out of Hulu because of the 4 locations change cap. Requires “static” ip address.  Tech support said this cannot be changed.  So… back it went to att.A month later I received a-bill for $121.71 ( two months) .  I called to make sure we are not charged to card.  Charges waived. Told toDisregard emails about return,billing etc.Three months later I got an automated email notification that my account will go to collection for amount of $67.81.  Had to call to get this fixed since automated email would destroy my credit rating.  They (billing) saidagain to ignore any automated emails as account will be closed ( it should have been closed the first time).",1

"Decided to switch from my old carrier in January 2023.  Ordered the lavender Galaxy 23 Plus in early February 2023.  Still didn't have it by my birthday (02/26), and was told by the local store that somehow the order got cancelled.  Local store reordered it in and finally I visit the store to get it on March 14th, 2023.  I ordered lavender but all that the store had was black, as lavender is allegedly still on backorder... Had also picked out a lavender case before I even put in the original order, but at the store, no lavender cases.  Sat there for over an hour awaiting the data transfer, then $184 later, I'm out the door with the phone... only to discover at home that all of my calls and most of my text messages are still going only to the phone from my former carrier.  Didn't get anything that I wanted out of this deal other than a new phone, but I could have walked out the door with it from my old carrier for about $20 cheaper.  This is a horrible way to start a new relationship with a customer and I am seriously considering a return since I'm still in the 14-day window.  The employee who helped me along the way has been nothing but courteous and professional, but I feel like ALL of this should have been taken care of by now.  So annoyed!",1
I and others I know purchased a galaxy 22 ultra.  It has been the most frustrating phone I have ever owned.  It gives me more problems and has more issues.  I wish I still had my note 9.  It was great.  I believe something is wrong with the S22 Ultra.  I am far from happy with this phone!!,1
"First my email address was hacked then I changed the primary email, then I noticed they changed it back to the old primary email. Which I asked them to remove the old email from my account which they never did.My wi-fi on my pc is 2.4 when it is supposed to be 5ghz.I received a duplicate phone number however, the business that I received the duplicate number changed their number after I contacted them.They do not like to respond by email to complaints they prefer to call and then it's your word against theirs.I am not interested in going to another company, they should just fix the issues and try to keep their especially long-time customers. Now, I do not want Fiber, I am satisfied with the service I have now.Well, I received a notice that they are charging $5.00 more for internet, and I do not have Fiber. No excuse for the increase.The service was hacked, and they sent out a letter informing the customers, now they want to increase the internet service. Not good customer service from At&t.My former router modem which I received was not refurbished it still had old customers information such as parent child safety which kept me from making changes to router modem, so I just sent it back and received a replacement.What are they doing to retain their customer's?No Senior citizen discounts. lolJust expect better from them especially since my bills are up to date not that it makes a difference.Well, I will be checking out other internet services as of now!",1
"It is a good thing that AT&T provides me with good cellular service because I had a horrible experience with a representative when I was in an AT&T store to buy a new phone.  I was snapped at and spoken rudely to by the service representative. I don’t know if there is no training being given to these service representatives, or whether this woman was having a horrendous day, but there is no reason why a service representative should snap at a customer.",1
"I have a pre-pay plan that works for me. The only way to get any customer service is to go to my store. If you call you will be on the phone for a very long time. My first experience at the ATT store was awful. I purchased a new smart phone, my first one, and the man that waited on me told me that he could not transfer my phone numbers. He also didn't show me anything about the phone. I called the next day and talked to someone else and she told me to come back to the store and she would help me. I went in and she was very nice and helpful. I also talked to the manager of the store and made a complaint about my first experience. If I need anything I always call ahead and make sure that the woman who helped me is there. It seems that there is not a lot of good customer service at a lot of stores these days.",1
I've been a customer for over 25 years at the same address.  All of a sudden my phone doesn't work and my bill is paid.  They sent a Service Tech who could not fix things.  I'm so mad I could spit.,1
"I had AT&T internet service at a rural location, and it has been consistently terrible from the start. I grew tired of constantly having to call them to complain about it (as they couldn't do anything to make it better anyway). Daily, we had to reset the router to get it working again, and the speed varied between 1 and 15 Mbps (averaging around 8 when it felt like working). After enduring a couple of years of this ""service,"" I was relieved to find that T-Mobile offered a more affordable solution.When I called AT&T to discontinue the service, the salesperson suggested ""suspending"" the account instead of closing it. This sounded good at the time since I was unsure whether T-Mobile would be worse than them. Unfortunately, the salesperson failed to mention that the service would automatically resume after 3 months.T-Mobile ended up being three times faster (without the resets!) for less than half the cost of AT&T. Needless to say, there was no reason to reactivate AT&T service. However, they still had my credit card on file, and it turns out they had been charging me for over 5 months—over $100/mo—before I caught it on my credit card statement. And please note that when I went online to check the account it was shown as disabled!When I called them to address the issue, they acknowledged the mistake and mentioned that it would take multiple weeks to rectify, promising a callback. I explicitly told them to close the account. Unfortunately, they never called me back. After seeing yet another bill, I called them again. This time they couldn't charge it since I had them remove my credit card from the file. During the call, they agreed that the account should have been closed, and the charge was invalid.I'm still waiting for them to call me with my $500+ refund, but instead, I received a notice from the collection agency for the money they couldn't charge me after the second attempted account closure. If this is not an example of extreme incompetence, I don't know what is. AT&T, get your act straight and give me my money back! Please!Update 1/3/24: Upgrading from 1 star to 3 stars. After multiple further unsuccessful engagements with AT&T customer support, I ended up initiating a dispute which prompted ATT Office of the President (top tier customer support) contacting me. Donato A. was able to help me and issue the refund as well as cancel the invalid debt collection. Thank you Donato!",1
Just switched my business to AT&T phone and internet due to the promise of fiber internet. Was previously with Comcast and didn't really have a big problem with them. Switched about 1 month ago and since then I've noticed about a quarter of the voicemails we receive are chopped up and cannot be comprehended. Fortunately I can get envelope information with the phone number the message was received from and call them back but the information in the message has to be relayed again which is frustrating for the customer as well as us.Finally made contact with AT&T and was surprised to hear that this has been a known issue that is apparently a problem with Verizon wireless customers leaving voicemails. The representative told me there is nothing AT&T can do about it as it's a problem on Verizon's side of things. The problem happens with Verizon customers that are within the state that try to leave voicemails. Out of state Verizon customers don't have that problem apparently.My cell phone service is through Verizon and I have left messages at my shop that are clear and have no problem.It's not the end of the world as I can just get envelope information about the not decipherable call and call them back. But people that take time to leave a voicemail usually leave information that I'd like to have prior to calling them back so it makes the process a little more inconvenient.AT&T offered no type of time line on resolution and told me it was a problem Verizon has to deal with not them. I never had this issue before with Comcast and only first had this problem come up the day we switched from Comcast to AT&T.Just a little disappointed in the AT&T service and the response to this problem.,1
"Customer service is the worst ever. Talked to three different people over the course of an hour to add someone to my phone line and learned nothing after that time. Had to give ALL my information three times, one time for each customer service rep.Phone service is good",1
"The automated system would NOT give me an option to pay on my own. Maybe this is on purpose because as nice as the lady was, you at corporate FORCE THEM TO BUG THE CRAP OUT OF US. FOUR TIMES, I said, no, thank you to her sales spiels. Stop bothering us and let us just pay the bill. If we wanted to hear specials, we can ask. The call at that point was so long, I died, dried up into a mummy, was reincarnated and then died again.",1
"the stupid cell phone wouldnt play the mp3 i got off gcnlive for alex jones or some file as i remember,yet i did like how if you ran out of data the internet still worked at a lower speed",1
"I have been with AT&T wireless for about 30 years altogether. They use to be OUTSTANDING. Without question, the best service and customer service across the country.Then they bought Direct TV ... who was sinking because of their HORRIBLE customer service. AT&T put in Direct TV people and they were destroyed.I have no customer loyalty to them any more because they don't value me.",1
"We live in a rural area, so our only choice was DSL. The bill is much cheaper than satellite at just $56 per month. It runs one or two TVs at a time, but we do have to deal with buffering if we try to use our living room and bedroom tv simultaneously. Also had a difficult time getting everything set up, customer support would constantly tell us something different everyday. I also wish this internet would run my tv and my daughter's tablet at the same time.",1
"The internet and TV works when they do but when they encounter issues, that's when the nightmare starts. Customer service sucks. Long wait queue just to be transferred to I don't know where. Would always to suck money out of your pocket. Beware of their scheme. For every call, they will sell things you don't need and for sure won't use.",1
"I was so happy when I saw that At & T added the extra HBO and movie channels free during the wknd and Monday and then they took them away especially in these hard times they should show some loyalty and humanity for so many people at home when so many other companies and people are helping with money and compassionate actions..Sad..thinking of changing after contract is over..Lake Forest, CA 92630:( :( :(",1
Hardly any Service in my town. At home I have to use Wifi to call and text. I work from my phone so i need a good connection and it doesnt get a good signal at all hardly a bar.and Ill be in the middle of town .Tell us in that area you dont have good service and stop wasting our money.They do have the Best prepaid ratesNew service here i come I cant deal with it anymore.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer since I bought my first cell phone years ago.  Last week I purchased a replacement phone as my current cell phone had ""had it"".  Was advised that it would arrive between the 24th and 26th of Dec.  Christmas eve was told that now it it would be delayed by ONE MONTH.  I cancelled my order and went online at Best Buy, and FOUR HOURS later walked away with a better phone. Maybe AT&T should just direct us to Best Buy!",1
"AT&T is the service I use and have had for the last three months.  I got the new iPhone 13 and I’ve had 5g auto on the whole time( I’m the settings for cellular), we don’t get 5g with AT&T in grants pass so my phone has been going back and forth trying to search for a network. Thus, giving me slow speeds and using all my battery. I switched my phone to LTE only and I’ve not had any problems with connectivity, overheating, or my battery just plain dying. I wish this was something they explained to me while I was there because my battery health, nearly in a brand new iPhone is at 94%. There was nothing that anyone knew that could be causing This issue beside a “defect to the phone” I’m gonna say it’s the “5g” networks we do not receive that messes with our data.",1
I have been an AT&T customer for 5 years. They advertise the best 5G..... I have one of the newest phones out...still 4G. It honey depends on your location. I walk into work and have 1 bar. They guy next to me has Verizon with 4 bars. Direct TV is a Rip off...... Customer service is horrible. My Note9 works great at home but unfortunately I'm at work more than home. They all have their ups and downs. I've had both and honestly will be going back to Verizon soon......,1
"They're a mobile company what do you expect. The service works, they provide good service (have used as a customer and as a business-business is better service!). What more do you want? They are a corporation making money from a oligopoly and should be regulated as a utility for the public good but that's not for me to decide.",1
"Does anyone really love their cable or phone provider? In my many experiences, AT&T is not the worst, but it is also not the best. Their mobile service is decent, U-Verse TV is average and incredibly high-priced, but their internet has been some of the best I have had in Florida. So, 3 stars it is!",1
"I, personally, have never had any problem with AT&T, but I will be switching to a different carrier only because of their support and promotion of OAN and their contributions to other issues I do not morally condone or agree with.",1
"Decided to cancel my ATT cellular plan two months back. Was promised a free Iphone11 on my second visit with loyalty service only to receive my bill and be over charged $10. Manager said there’s no record from phone call with loyalty rep that she offered the phone for free or that she promised a specific billing price that would incur until I changed plan. Att has no loyalty to customers, only to con their customers to be falsely offered something over the phone so there is no evidence of transaction to keep us happy until billing arrives. Unbelievable that there is nothing in loyalty report to support my recall of discussion.",1
"Not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, not as good as they claim. Thanks, Kevin from customer support for trying to help me. Worked to a certain degree.",1
"I opened an AT&T account in August of 2018. I had to pay for one Galaxy S9, and I received  one free. A couple of days ago one of the phones just shut for no apparent reason. My fiance had to buy a replacement $89.00 phone for that evening. AT&T tell us that the phone warranty is up and we would have to pay $112.00 deductible in order to recieve the same device. She nor I  did anything to cause the device to stop working. I never had a device from any carrier who's device just shut down. We have insurance for damages, or theft only. How can you give out devices that can't last until the upgrade period is applicable. Each customer should know they may have to spend additional funds if AT&T devices decide to stop working at the time of purchase.",1
"Maybe I expected too much...not! Got great service initially from the folks at the Kiosk at Windward Mall. Was excited that they were going to have a permanent store there. In the meantime I went to the store at Windward City and when they felt like speaking with me (TV was on and they were busy watching) I got misinformation. That's okay, people make mistakes. Went back, got help. Went to the new  store in Windward Mall. The young man was sarcastic when I explained my question, (Do you folks have customer service training?) then gave me the wrong information (low storage doesn't always mean you need a bigger card in your phone), I already had a larger card in my phone but he didn't look so how would he know. I cannot wait to end my contract, T-mobile was a little more money so I moved but am happy to go back and pay more for great customer service!",1
AT&T appears to listen to their reviews. We will follow with their business promises. It seems none of us want guns in the hands of babes. Good choice.,1
"Why 3 stars?  Love my reception and phone but customer service is lacking and confused at best.   In the last 5 weeks I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with them.  I went back and added up the time.... (it's actually close to 11 and I am currently on the phone with them now)  This isn't a COVID thing, it was like this pre-COVID.  If you ask the same question to 5 people in CS, you get 5 different answers.  None are close to the others.  Someone needs to make a manual and share it with the employees and give them answers to questions people ask.I traded in 2 phones about 4 months... still no credit.  Auto Pay is a joke.  I paused it (I never opted in to use it), but it took out money anyway.  I cancel auto pay and have to pay $20 additional each month because I don't use AUTOPAY. I've been a customer 10 years, obviously I pay my bill.The only time I drop calls is when I call them and they transfer me..... it happens often then, but that's the only time.The other options aren't any better, but I do wish they would improve the customer service over the phone.",1
"Have cingular then it became AT&T. Ive been with them since they merged. What gets my goat is, they have unlimited data, but have data caps. When its busy they slow down your data speed. I have an older plan with 6 shared gigs. All the new plans have unlimited and most other companies offer unlimited. I was looking at the samsung Z flip for my wife. ATT told me they would give me the phone free if I trade my note 9 in and agree to a 36 month contract I wanted to keep my $1000 phone. So I can sign a 3 year contract and pay off the phone every month. I wanted to do a contract and pay for the phone with an upgrade discount. But nope they won`t do that. I also pointed out that Tmobile is giving away the 128gig samsung z flip for free to new customers and add a second line and they will give you an $800 off a second smart phone of your choice. So what`s my motivation to stay with ATT when I still only have a 6 shared gig plan and they are offering nothing for upgrading your plan. My contract has been fulfilled many months ago and the company is getting cheap with promo`s so maybe consider moving to Tmobile or Verizon. Both are offering better deals and stealing ATT customers. They must have so many they don`t really care.",1
"I've been an AT&T customer my entire life. My family was back when they were Cingular Wireless, and then I got on my own plan when I was an adult. I am in my 30's. My primary reason for staying with AT&T so long was the good coverage and reasonable pricing, because any time I needed to make any changes to my account such as get a new phone, it was a nightmare and took hours to get everything all swapped over. Well, that good pricing recently changed. AT&T does not include their line access charges in their plan quotes like Verizon does, so you actually wind up paying significantly more than the advertised price. I think the thing that bothered me most, is when I contacted AT&T via chat to see what could be done now that we needed a new phone (which required their unlimited plans), the rep kept giving me different quotes, lied (hopefully accidentally) to me and told me the total she gave included the line access, then turned around and said it didn't. I don't feel like AT&T is clear on the charges that will be on your bill and that's extremely frustrating when trying to pick a plan. And honestly that whole experience plus the last few experiences I've had trying to get new phones has prompted this review. Verizon was transparent about everything on their site. Verizon was able to offer us free Hulu and Disney+ with our current plan, so that reduces a monthly expense for us, plus offer unlimited.",1
"My recent contact with AT&T wasn't about their service, it was about upgrading to a new phone. I have had AT&T for a very long time and although have had issues with dropped calls, so has other providers. My online experience today was good, but the person I was chatting with had limited access and knowledge to what I was looking for in a phone and seemed to be unaware that what I was looking for does exist. I am looking to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 7 active and the 2 features an upgrade must have is Gorilla Glass screen, not a protector you add or an otter box, but an actual Gorilla Glass screen. Was told that it had to be purchased separately. Not true...my current phone the Samsung Galaxy S7 active came factory with Gorilla Glass and totally water proof. My next must be is water proof. Couldn't get a clear answer about the phone they were recommending about the specs of the phone which they say the Samsung S 20 Ultra is similar to what I have. That isn't what I'm looking for... it must have the Gorilla glass. Was suggested I could pay for the added protection in case my screen should get shattered... I understand the concept, but build a better phone and you have to protection built in like with the Galaxy S7 active. Having insurance doesn't help if my phone screen gets shattered in the middle of the night and I can not use my phone. Build a better phone.",1
"I don't hate AT&T and I also don't love them.... I've had them for about 10 years ever since my ex-husband wanted an iPhone for Christmas and this was when they had the exclusive so we switched carriers and plans to get them.  I've been with them ever since.I travel a lot - and often out of the country - so I usually use one of their plans where I can use my phone so I have data, text and can make calls at a discounted rate.  It's expensive to purchase one of their pre-set plans for about $60 or $150.  The last time I did this I was saddled with a $220 phone call from a Kyoto (Japan) hotel to another where I thought I had left a favorite pair of pants (which I hadn't and were actually not even packed in my bag and were safe at home, bummer).I called - and they fed me some BS about how even if I had paid for the plan I couldn't use wifi and showed me where it was on like page 47 of their plan I signed up for.  It was super confusing and didn't make sense.  Instead of arguing I asked what we could do now after the fact since I had obviously tried to avoid that by paying in advance for the travel plan.  They backdated some plan for me and modified the call to about $30.  Still more than I thought I should pay but it was better than the $220.This happens a lot when I travel but the bottom line is, calling in and asking them or paying the $10 overseas fee to use it daily is probably best.  Or perhaps a SIM card.Otherwise I don't have major issues with AT&T.  They're pretty good as far as my regular plan goes and I've made minimal changes in the past 10 years.  It works for me.",1
"When AT&T advertises a ""Buy One-Get One"" deal - buyer beware! NOTHING is free with AT&T!My BOGO deal was a ""free"" iPhone 7 when purchasing (signing a contract for) an iPhone 7+. After the purchase, I noticed a recurring credit of $21 on my bill. I thought it was because of certain discounts I get for membership in an organization AT&T honors, so I didn't pay much attention to the credit.Later, when I was able to pay off all my mobile devices, I noticed my bill had increased over $300! After arguing with the customer service rep, I was informed that AT&T had expected me to continue the installment payment plan for the iPhone 7+ for 30 months. But because I paid the balance for the installment plan after only 17 months, I was now liable for the remaining balance for the ""BOGO"" iPhone 7. I was INCREDULOUS!When I objected, the lady told me that I was informed this would happen at the time I paid off the balance. However I was never informed and told the customer service rep that if they wanted the $300 for the ""free"" phone they should take it out of the other rep's paycheck because he failed to inform me of the consequences of paying off the balance of the installment plan.Of course, she said they couldn't do that. So I demanded that AT&T should absorb the $300 because it's a misunderstanding and, after all, I've been a loyal customer for 25 years and it would be good customer relations. I said if AT&T would do this, I would make my satisfaction known publicly through Social Media. However, if AT&T failed to handle this in my favor, I said I would take that experience public on Social Media as well.The customer service rep paused for a moment, put me on hold, and voila! When she reconnected with me she said they had worked out a deal for me. If I ""technically"" put the iPhone 7 BACK on an ""installment plan,"" they could continue the monthly $21 credit until the balance of the installment plan was paid, with nothing coming out of my pocket! I agreed to this compromise, and AT&T has held up their end of the bargain. So, AT&T is now paying for their own ""free"" BOGO phone again.This issue was, indeed, resolved to my satisfaction, and ALL of the 3 service reps I spoke with were courteous, friendly, and competent.But remember, AT&T + BOGO = Buyer Beware!! Nothing is ""free"" with AT&T.",1
"Service in the UK is OK. But roaming abroad is a nightmare. Bought a data upgrade plan for use while travelling in the US but never worked once while I was there. Followed all the instructions for setting up your phone properly, including going through all the id mobile help forums and adjusting esoteric settings. But other users report exactly same problem with roaming outside the EU. Will be going back to a big provider at end of contract.",1
My number didn't seem to transfer over properly even though I used the switching service. The new number was displayed when I sent text messages instead of my old one. I didn't get missed call notification when people tried to ring me. I had problems for the first month which hopefully have  now been sorted out. It would have been really good to have been able to take my phone to someone to help me instead of things been done online.,1
"What I like: buying from ID was easy and effortless, good communication too. Everything looks good, but! Probably it's the Three network, but rather often I have no internet access even when the phone shows 4G and 3 bars out of 4. It just doesn't work... Annoying, far worse than EE what I had before.",1
"The operator, while polite and friendly my issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. My subsequent billing was not very well explained and promises made by the sales team were not kept.",1
"The monthly contract fee is decent, unfortunately the internet connection/coverage is very poor. With the previous provider I had 5G very often, but here I haven't encountered it yet.",1
"Generally Ok but they will change your monthly costs in the middle of your contract.. what seemed like a good offer initially is merely Okay.What goods a contract if they can just change it at will?Everyone's living costs have increased, how about I renegotiate with you a little less? Is that fair too?Additionally they will continue to charge you full price for your handset even after it's paid off (24months)",1
I'm generally happy with ID service but there is one annoying issue which is very frustriting. Basically being recently in Central London and Manchester my mobile internet just did not work at all despite having full 5G signal recepton. I am guessing this is because of the fact my ID sim's bandwidth is reduced to near zero in very congested areas. I want to highlight this is purely network issue as my wife and daughter (also on ID network) experience was exactly the same. This is an area you need to improve big time.,1
"ID as a company I have nothing but praise for, cheap, great app, great online backup.I've been with them for years.Sadly though it's the now pretty appalling ""3"" network they run their services on. And it is so awful now I've had to leave ID.I live in a decent sized town and there's is now zero signal pretty much everywhere within it, and I can't get any signal in my house at all. It's got slowly worse and worse over the last couple of years. Yet despite repeated complaints, ID can't seem to get 3 to do anything, and 3 dont even bother respond when approached directly.So it's a thumbs up to ID, but do check 3's dubious network before you commit!",1
"I disliked the fact that iD list 50 countries that are covered in their roaming packages, only to find out after getting on board, that Italy is not one of the countries covered…… Potentially, I will now have to pay more on top of my monthly tariff ! Also, I notice that there appears to be no facility to add funds to use premium numbers, like “61054” which is a Greatest Hits Radio Premium SMS number. Any chance either of the above will change soon ?",1
Great service in terms of delivery. Good app and prompt delivery of new handset plus returns envelope for old handset. Unfortunately I’m still yet to receive the payment for my old handset. 2 emails but no reply!,1
"Never got 5g connectivity in the same device which I was using, while I was with three UK. Even 4g speed is not that great. Thinking of changing ID soon. Even in central London internet speed is too slow, than think outside London area. Also no call centre where you can get any help, everything online or a chat bot. Using ID SIM from last 45 days and not so impressed.",1
"Generally happy with the cost and reliability while I am out and about, but unfortunately I am unable to get a signal while I am at home. I did check before switching to you to ensure I should be able to get a signal at home but there is clearly a problem. My post code is HR9 5UF",1
"Great price but patchy network.I know they use Three’s network, so it’s not specifically their fault, but I regularly go through black spots and places where you only get 3G coverage - which is prettt useless these days.Thought it was a result of living in north Nottinghamshire, but had the same issues on the M1 near Daventry today.Good access along the country’s main motorways should be a given.",1
The service were I live is rubbish even though on the checker it said it was okI use the wifi calling when at home as the phone signal is rubbishEven in London it's a bit hit and missI made a mistake moving to this I'd and I'm stuck with it for the next 23 months,1
"I feel the price of contracts are reasonable but I tried to open 3 contracts for me , my wife and my child and they wouldn't let me due to some crazy policy and I was only aloud to open 2 which was one of the points I was swapping providers",1
"Decent enough network, but not outstanding.Technical issue from 2022 still hasn't been resolved two years later: namely, can't receive SMS while roaming from non-UK numbers. Works on Three but not on iD Mobile.Cancelling your contract is laborious and talking to robots and chat agents to achieve, which is ridiculous in 2024.",1
Whilst the phone package I currently use is competitive - my ability to connect to family etc over the last 3-4 weeks has been disgraceful. At time I have been able to contact people inc husband who was sitting next to me …I believe ID use the 3 network..Will be looking for a new supplier after Xmas…,1
I am disappointed with the network signal coverage it  is very poor in alot of areas  with signal coming and going regularConstantly  1-2 bars 3 on a good day never seen the  full signal filled.,1
"I’m with ID mobile for more than year, and happy enough. Signal is very average even in city centre of Belfast and text message sometimes last long until is received, long mean a day which happened yesterday and that is obviously not great.",1
"I am elderly and would like to have a customer service that I can speak to….to guide me through where I want to go.  I suppose a chat bit might do ,but not very user friendly.",1
Great deal with phone and sim but very bad reception. Can use phone indoors very often with data switched on have to use WiFi. And very often calls don't go through.,1
I live in a poor reception area and have considered finding better cover. There is nothing more annoying than when your call drops out.Your Web site shows that you cover my area. Sadly only poorly.,1
The lack of being able to contact someone at ID Mobile from the website is not good. There is information available on the website but it's a pain having to find it especially if the subject is not covered by any of the FAQ's and most of the stuff written by the 'ID' community does not interest me. It would be so much easier if you could email someone even with a short character limited message,1
At home I have WIFI so no problem but when I am in my caravan in the Malverns the 4g signal is not connecting to my phone my partner on her phone no problem she is with Tesco.,1
sometimes the signal could be better but overall ID offer good value for money and service.  some sort of app feature to identify and feedback poor signal areas would help identify areas for network improvement's to address the poor signal / no signal areas and also improve the coverage map to more closely show actual performance rather than predicted coverage.,1
Was trying to switch both of my EE expired contracts to id but there was issues activating simThen when deleted e sim had issues getting replacement as one was sent for wring nr and other not sent at all so had to pick up from currys .Overall contacted them on many occasions customer service very robotic and not good .Going to another provider now as first impression wasnt good as well as the signal.,1
I dislike the fact a new customer can get a better deal than existing customers  there was an I phone se 3rd generation for £19.99 a month which i took out and couldn’t keep my number if I got upgraded it was £22.99 for same phone with less data,1
I can never get an assistant at my local Currys when I go in. Your staff in the past have been very helpful but it's really hard to get a member of staff now.  As a pensioner I am not technically on the ball so find it very frustrating.,1
"Changed to ID as existing supplier was increasing cost for less , kept same number and the change over was faultless. Joined ID as received email saying 5 g available in my area and coverage map showed it was , problem is its not , on 1 bar on 4 G and download speed of 1. 5 MBS at most , the roll over data is pointless as not fast enough service to use the monthly allowance never mind roll over . It however seems that miss information regarding service availability is not grounds to cancel contact so stuck in a 12 months con which is all but useless . Customer se work from a script so totally un pre to deal with most cases. As seems to be the norm , any company that has communication as its core also seems to have Communication missing from its customer service.",1
Having notified you in August of my change of address I was disappointed to receive (eventually) your letter dated December—I have sent you a paper reply and instructionsYou were not the only people to ignore my change of address!!Juliet R,1
"I needed to change my plan to suit a new phone, but it just won't let me change. It is tolerable with the plan I already had, but I'm seriously considering going elsewhere. The process of selecting a new plan is absurdly complex. Given idmobile's reply about lengths of contract (why is it always something the customer has done wrong) I should have pointed out that I have been five years with idmobile, a contract has ended, and what I was trying to do was set up a new plan. I just kept going round in circles getting nowhere, their help bot didn't cover my issue, and their help line was hopelessly hard to reach, and the one time I got through they gave me advice irrelevant to my problem.",1
"Data coverage is terrible—it's nowhere near as good as O2, but you get what you pay for, I suppose. The deal's price bundled with other stuff I got was good, but the 5G signal is shocking. I have to wait until I can buy out the remainder of my contract to move back now, which is very disappointing.",1
Increasing bad coverage even in large urban areas such as London. Downloads on 4G painfully slow. Even when connected to 5G speed is very poor at times,1
"The signal I receive is very mixed at times. Even in a city like Southampton, I received close to no signal at all whilst my partner on another network had full service.",1
"Signal drops out, call fails to complete, people complain that they can't hear us quoting poor sound bad line. I was under there impression we were supposed to be getting 5G before the end of this year and 2 & 3G were closing down, well the last I heard from someone at ID was we have three antennas around us 2 were 2g 1 was 3g when do we get 5g on all our antennas giving us a very good signal not poor to average, in THE DN8 4SZ AREA of Doncaster",1
"I dislike that in busy locations I'm often unable to access the internet via my ID Mobile contract on my iPhone whereas other people not on ID Mobile are happily streaming videos and making Facetime calls. Likewise (and this might be just a quirk of geography) I'm unable to get online at all during about 60% of my commute home, whereas plenty of other passengers on the train can. I occasionally ask what network they're on; it's never ID Mobile. But, ID Mobile is cheap and when it works it's ok, hence 3 stars not lower.",1
Generally happy - good plan and price.However I was sent a notification with someone else’s number on it and could not contact you to notify. Eventually just deleted it. Would prefer a better means of contact to resolve such issues.,1
I find it difficult  sometimes to make calls when I'm out and about coverage is inconsistent or sometimes it will just drop Even at   get either 1 or two bars when other people with me get better reception,1
"I find the coverage is patchy when it comes to Internet connection. I often find I can not connect to the web when out and about in Glasgow, never mind more remote places. Accessing my online account is not always possible either so it's a good thing they allow you to cap your spend as I rarely know how much data I have left.",1
"Good the price and Europe roaming.Bad: a lots of locations no reception, impossible to speak to a person from ID at the time of need. It is not possible to use in North America under any plan.",1
"I have been a customer for the last 8years, last 2 on a sim only deal. Was going to change provider due to bad reception. Applied for pac number, but received a call from your sales, who persuaded me to upgrade to a samsung A16. Phone to big and to heavy, like a brick!!. Trying to return it has been a trial. My local Currys {Telford] would not accept it.Talked to a helpful person via chatbot [Preston].would much rather be speaking to a live person, would have been much quicker and easier.",1
"I changed my package last year from pay monthly to sim only. The option I needed was not available on the web site & couldn't be done by phone because there wasn't a human to talk to. I had to go into a Curry's shop & because they are cutting their staff numbers & the training of those staff to the bone I had problems. I had to go back 3 times before somebody who was plainly overworked, underpaid & therefore didn't enjoy their job helped me out. He was brilliant, I have to say. The phone coverage is a bit spasmodic but funnily enough better away from home than in it!!!!!!",1
Price was good but set up painful. I wanted to transfer 4 family numbers from my Vodafone account but 2 is the maximum ID will allow at a time?!?! My credit rating is good and this was less than £30pm total sim only - what’s the risk?!!  Neither of the two numbers worked on the change over date so both times I had to have a lengthy conversation with the helpline desk. Now that I’m on things are ok though often the phone shows 2 or 3 bars of signal but can’t make calls or receive data.,1
"Firstly, you don’t seem to have an email address.  I recently had a query on my account for 07964907016.  I rang your company and spoke to a lady who was not all that helpful, she kept asking me if I wanted to make a complaint.  I don’t want to make a complaint, but I do have a query on my most recent bill.  I don’t remember making the call on 27 Nov which has cost me about £13.  The lady suggested I look at my “recents”.  I did that and the only call I made was through WhatsApp.  I have a screenshot of that, but without an email address how can I get it to you?",1
"They shouldn't cancel orders with message ""you failed credit check criteria"" for 8 pounds / month - is silly. Maybe is valid in India.They should say: you can create maximum 2 plans under the same account, as a general policy of ID m.",1
"I chose iD Mobile because of the price, which is why I'm giving 3 stars.But the network availability is pretty awful where I live in the west of Northern Ireland. This is despite the iD Mobile website telling me availability should be good / excellent.",1
"Coverage always good no matter where I am. Plans are wee bit expensive but not bad. Very difficult to switch plan though and the app is beyond uselss- tou can look but if you want to actually ""do anything"" there is ALWAYS - ""Oops something went wrong please try again in a few seconds""",1
"My husband and myself have both found  the signal very ‘variable’ these days unfortunately-We’ve been with ID for years and up to about a year ago was very happy with it.The ID app is straightforward , and the price is good- but sadly we’ve been thinking of changing provider and will have to pay more but hopefully have a better signal",1
"When using 4G data’s in my area, the reception is poor. Friends on other networks have a better reception than myself. It will probably be the difference next time, when renewal time comes.",1
For the last 6 months I’ve had a problem with my direct debit payment of £6 per month. Every month there has been a problem and I’ve had to pay manually. Even the agent tried to set it up and it failed. It’s frustrating that it’s so hard to speak to someone and that the simple matter of a direct debit seems to be un achievable. Another fail and I’ll find another provider,1
Booked a mistletoe  and martini break at thoresby hall very disappointed no celebration at all no decorations for Xmas.  Evening entertainment poor all we got was as singers every night no comedians or alternative entertainment at all.,1
"Bought this sim to travel around Europe with and it was a decent price with good data limits and coverage. If this is where it ended I would probably give id at least a 4 star rating. However, if you ever have a problem with your plan (which I have had many) then dealing with the customer service is a pain. You have to fight to chat to a real person in the online form, and when you get to a real person they are clearly just working from a simple script meaning they are not much better than the robot.To top it off, once I got back from travelling I immediately cancelled my sim using the id mobile app, however a month on and I have received an email saying I have outstanding balance. They have attempted to charge me an extra month after I have cancelled my plan and now I am stuck on customer service again sorting it out.Will not be recommending id to anyone.",1
"The signal coverage is not good, I’d use 3 network, I was with 3 and the coverage was better when with them.There isn’t a customer service team available",1
"Couldn't use my phone because I had allegedly gone over my limits, found this hard to believe when i took out a higher rate of payment a few months ago",1
"The price is great and I have a good amount of data.  However, the coverage in my area when it is cloudy means that I am unable to make a phone call.  As I don't have a landline this has sometimes been a problem.  This does mean that I might have to get another provider.",1
Reasonably priced. Coverage seems to be similar to other providers. Renewing or changing your contract is not easy online. They got my billing wrong when I changed and took a n age to get it sorted.,1
I got in touch with id mobile via my chat because I upgraded my id mobile sim to 5g but I wanted to keep my present id mobile number but instead of me keeping my number with id they put me a payg so how do I keep my present number with id mobile?.,1
Signal in my area is low. Intermittent connection unless stay out in the open space. Package is good at the time of taking on but now there are plenty of better deals around.It’s good but not the best.,1
"Trying to set up roaming abroad especially for Ireland impossible. Also when needing to contact you, it is again impossible, why can't we have a real person to talk to that will explain and hopefully resolve your problem",1
"I moved from O2 due to their poor network coverage,  and on the recommendation of my wife who is with you. The price and the move were fine but, despite several attempts, we were not given the £30 ""introduction offer"" promised. Poor effort I'd mobile.",1
I am not able to see on my phone how many minutes I have used on telephone calls. Until the app was changed this information appeared without any problem but it.now is unavailable.,1
Signal is very poor on this networkSome issues setting it up! I for some reason now have two phone numbers and the support page has not helped (not been able to speak to a real person just yet)Not sure if I regret moving from EE,1
"Chat looks like the only official way of asking and sorting problems.The reply between chat replies takes too much time and I can't stay not stop waiting for an answer from the id operator.What I do is to move out of the web page, with an ear set and listen to the click sound when they reply back. Unfortunately without this trick is almost impossible to reach a solution in the chat.Is a pity, I moved to Id m. due to the service quality. They should fix this quickly.",1
Cheap tariff but coverage is poor at times. We have several phones in the house all using iD sims. Some phones get coverage while others don’t even sitting in the same room of the house.,1
when I was in Japan I could not use the mobile and when I came back it was still blocked. WHY? I can pay- just deduct it- In UK I have no complaints but if I go abroad I want a proper service!!!,1
Competitive pricing. I guess its what you get when everything is digital these days. Not the greatest customer service when things go wrong because they are almost impossible to contact.,1
There are some hidden costs to my tariff that if I had known would have chosen a different tariff/provider. I am charged for group text messages and the use of emojis in text messages.,1
It is competitively priced.My wife often gets much beter reception accross the uk on EECant freeze account when im notvusing it for months if i travel out of europeCant speak to a customer supportThe free roaming in Europe is great,1
"The ID company is good,it is easy to change contract online and they send the new phone to your address no hassle. The only issue I have is the network is not working very well the signal is not good enough. The phones are great and the price is good but the network lets them down so I won't be renewing my contract next year.",1
"Disappointing over all. Contract price - excellent, handset price - excellent, coverage moderate to poor almost everywhere unless you are roaming in a European country!It is difficult to get a decent mobile signal  most of the time. Typically only one bar and when mobile data is indicated as 4G on the handset the internet simply does not work. When 5G is indicated on the handset (almost nowhere) the internet is like ""lightening"" and internet calling is available, so, the phone actually works like a phone.Cheaper than Vodafone by a country mile, however, I wish I had toughed it out and stuck with Vodafone, no problems with mobile data/phone signal with them. I should have known that anything virtual and piggy-backed off 3 mobile would be a disaster no mater what they say about how good it is!Hopefully, the merger between Vodafone and 3 Mobile will go ahead and things will massively improve - fingers crossed. In the mean time, I would avoid ID mobile unless you only want to use your phone in continental Europe.Once again, disappointing!",1
Your fare EU travel usage if you’re in the Europe for longer than some weeks is unfair. The uk is no longer in the EU why would you need to introduce this policy.,1
"could not receive any phone calls, used web chat to get help the operator was useless and took 50 minutes establishing I was a customer, she could read what I had typed or chose to ignore it and keep asking her standard question, when i finally did get to explain my problem she said its too hard and would refer it to the technical team, they never go back to me. The support at ID is very very poor.",1
"Good value for money and the ID mobile app is user friendly.The mobile signal is not the greatest, 2 bars at best at most times of the day in various locations within Sussex.",1
"Good service until you go to upgrade. New phone, new plan 32.99 as an upgrade. 22.99 as a new customer. No reward for loyalty. Been with them for 6 years but am leaving once my final bill is 1 months rental. There are better deals out there!",1
The overall contract is good value - the mobile roaming among the best in the market.The upgrade process I have been through is ridiculous as there was only one possible SIM-only contract available without going through the palaver of porting off to another carrier and then coming back on a lower price lower Data limit.,1
Very patchy coverage. BT19 where I work is very poor. Friends on other networks always seem to have better signal than I do.No issues with ID other than poor signal.,1
Just visited USA and couldn’t get my phone to work while over there. I don’t like that there isn’t a contact number to speak to a human and everything is online. I don’t find it easy to find answers,1
Can not understand why the price has to increase every year in line with inflation?The cost should rise for the consumables part of the contract but not the phone which was sold at a set priceNext PPI claims?,1
I got my daughters contract last year and the process and even porting her number was seamless. So I thought I would order myself a sim only contract when my contract ended. The website was a disaster! I couldn’t check out for ages so asked on live chat if I had been accepted because I did not receive an email to confirm! They put me through eventually to a call back! The woman on the call back could not find my Information so went through a new application with me! When the email arrived it was the wrong term 24 months instead of 30 days rolling contract so I did not sign it this happened twice!  3 days later I decided to try again and this time I could check out but still no confirmation. 48 hours later I contacted the live chat to check status (I took a screenshot of order number but it meant nothing to them) as I was going through live chat I finally had an email confirming delivery with my new number so ported my new number using live chat! Which she did and it worked fine! They offered me £5 credit which I took but 2 weeks later and it has not appeared on my account! It’s a good job they are good value but I bet the company is losing money because it’s inconsistent website and the fact that it took me almost a week to buy a SIM card! The value is very good however the point of sales really needs looking at as does the website!,1
Extremely disappointed that you are still not covering USA and EU especially France and Germany (need it during my business trips)I Get additional costs on my subscription without real explanations.,1
I like the ID network. Good value for money and the mobile data roll over is great. However tI have found the new ID app impossible to use. It used to be great. I'd  log in and then it would crash. This happened over and over again so I have stopped using it.,1
"iDMobile is good value for money - I think I have a very good deal.  But I have given it three stars because:1. The only way to contact anyone seems to be by chat.  When I had a problem with a direct debit (see below) I wasn't able to talk to anyone: the only telephone number I could find on you web site is for complaints.  So I had to use chat and my experience is that operators mostly seem to answer the question before the last one I asked, or answer a question I never asked.2. I changed the account from which the direct debit is taken.  I entered the details correctly and your web site accepted them.  The first I knew of a problem was when I received a text message telling me that immediate payment was required and that my account had been suspended.  To find out what had happened I had to first pay the monthly amount.  That was challenging because I logged into your website using my laptop, tried to pay and got the very uninformative error message of ""Oops, something went wrong"".  I ended up paying by phone.  I could then ring my bank and found out that iDMobile hadn't set up the direct debit properly - the money had been taken from my account but because the bank hadn't received the necessary notification about the direct debit, it was immediately returned to my account.  I opened a chat window to talk about it with you and for some reason failed the ID checks - I think my PIN didn't validate (and yes, I'm certain I typed it correctly; and I verified it was set to what I thought it was after the chat) so ended up having to submit a photocopy of my passport and utility bill to get your operator to communicate with me. The only saving grace was that this had happened when I was at home so was able to use my computer (which is not reliant on iDMobile) to research and sort things out.  It could have been very awkward had I been abroad.At the very least, given how long I've been a customer (nearly six years), you could have given me a few days warning before suspending the account. And yes, after all that, I did make use of the single telephone number on your site to make a complaint.",1
"The 5g works very well. But only the 5g. In areas where there is only 4g showing, the internet either stops working or works at snails pace. This is not the case with 4g in other providors",1
"Signal is poor where I work and is a bit of an issue, would change to another supplier but can’t find another that isn’t more expensive so am sticking with it at the moment.",1
"I have two sides with ID mobile. I’ll try to break them both down here as to why this is currently 3 starsPrices - 5* I got ID with carphone warehouse. It is the cheapest deal around. 5G, 500GB per month WITH ROLL OVER? And a brand new iPhone and I’m paying under £35 a month? Prices are very goodCustomer service - no idea. Not tried it. Can’t comment. Would be unfair to do soSignal coverage - 1* - this is seriously the worst mobile coverage I have ever had in my life. I drop calls constantly, I have “5g” and yet I’m waiting on website slower than I would be using 4g sometimes, I can’t connect half the time in half the locations I’m in. Southish of England an hour or so out of London, signal is abysmal. I’ve had a mobile phone since 2003 so been using mobile contracts for 21 years, I’ve travel through Cambodia and Thailand and various other places. ID mobile where I am is THE worst signal I’ve ever experienced. Bar none. It’s crazy. I thought we were all on the same cel masts too?! So I don’t know why it’s SO bad but I went from EE to ID and my signal took a wild hit.So in summary, it works but I’m often getting a much lower quality product in terms of my service BUT I’m paying a very low price for it so I don’t know maybe you get what you pay for?If this improves I’ll update it",1
"Bought refurbished phone which was faulty, replacement phone was sent within 3 days, this one is also faulty but cannot be bothered with the hassle of returning another phone and having to transfer all data, apps etc,Would not recommend this service.",1
"Really good price and app works well. However, if you get into difficulty it’s all a bit of a support nightmare. If I have an issue I don’t want to go through bots and user groups I just want to talk to someone and at ID this in nearly impossible. So, would have been 5 stars but reduced to 3 because of this.",1
"After many years of having a mobile phone, they seems to do so many things, most not needed. The one thing that all mobile phones lack in is good coverage. It’s so frustrating when you are trying to have a conversation with someone and you loose signal! My dearest wish is that companies would concentrate on getting the infrastructure set in place. Then DAB radio would work and mobile phones as well",1
"No issues with the service, only complaint is with the bills. If your bill is over your contract amount it does not explain what the cost is for, this should be listed separately",1
"The phone service has been good, but the app hasn't worked for months now, so it's hard to keep track of data usage and charges. This has been very frustrating.",1
"It's a great network, excellent value for money including EU roaming. BUT! Try to get on the internet in central London and you will be bitterly disappointed! ZERO download speed. Even sending a WhatsApp message is a challengeCome on guys! You can do better than that.",1
"5G coverage is very sporadic.  Apparently unlimited roaming, but small print states limit of 30GB.  No means of identifying how much roaming data used on the app",1
"Customer services is fully automated, there is nobody to talk to. It's very poor is that.If you don't have a signal you can not contact your provider over the phone.I haven't spoke to anyone in the year I had this contract other than 15 mins on a text thing then I got cut off. I will not use ID mobile again.",1
"Don't know if it's my phone or ur coverage but my 4g is very slow. It can take an hour to receive a picture through messenger/whatsapp or to see a webpage, e.g. bbc weather. Person next to me in office receives far better signal. On the up side, I love the free roaming as I have 4-5 holidays abroad each year.",1
"Easy to transfer, Although my monthly rate did go up slightly shortly after I had joined. Reception is ok, Not as good as my previous phone company and I also now have ""dead"" spots around where I live which I never use to have.",1
Tryed to updated to my pay monthly non contract and was told I couldn’t as no had my id for a year but as I said I don’t have a contract?? But have to wait a year to changeBut could leave and come back and update to what I wantedWas offered money back on account but never received that,1
"I want clear information when I go to a roaming country. I have sometimes received a message to say charges will be added, even when in one of the 50 countries where roaming is allowed.Why isn’t Switzerland included?",1
"Most of the time I am experiencing reception issues, example, if I am in wembley, willesden, hampstead gardens and some more places, some time it's make me  frustrated. I am thinking to change another better provider.",1
If your phone is stolen the online only help is quite laborious to navigate - ok in the end but a bit of a car sick journey in the first 36 hours - hint if you haven't got your phone you can't do 2 factor authentication,1
"Works okay at home but abroad the roaming sometimes just doesn't work, there's no manned helpdesk and so no help. Also, it doesn't work on the tube, which is absolutely crazy.",1
"When there is a good signal and 5G coverage, all is well. As soon as my phone says 4G I know I'm in trouble and can forget trying to do anything internet dependent. Problem is, the coverage around the coasts of North Devon is very variable. and even in populated areas you can find yourself with poor or no connectivity. When I was with EE this was much more infrequently an issue.",1
"I seem to get this transfer money message several times a week.I don’t have any debts? Or need anything that I could not pay for now. If I needed any extra money, I would apply to yourselves as first stop.",1
"Under same account (aka email address) I ordered 3 plans, with 3 phone numbers.When I receive email there is no unique ID to identify each plan (diff. phone no.). There is no information to know for what phone number they write back.It is so much confusing.",1
"I have found id mobile great for my needs, OK coverage where I live and sensible pricing.  Downside is roaming in France/Spain.  It is advertised as included but the coverage/ signal strength is awful and rarely works.",1
You don't send out any free offers example free coffee vouchers or discount for shops etc .your network signal has gone down hill the last 6 months yes very disappointed lately.,1
Very reasonable rates never went up in the years that I subscribed. Left as I was having issues with phone reception in my home and I could get a better deal on data limit for the price.,1
"I get along fine with my phone,however it would be better if I could go into a shop and speak with someone,also to look and hold any new phone that I might be interested in the future. Joined you through car phone warehouse which no longer has any stores,that’s why I will probably switch to o2 when my contract expires.",1
"Most of the time coverage is good, but sometimes it’s very frustrating when you need coverage and it’s not around hence 3 stars otherwise it would be 4/5 the quality of calls is generally good I have not had to interact with the service department so far which is good",1
Both me and my wife have been with ID for years. Good network and Curry's are great if you have an issue.DOWNSIDE WHICH HAS ONLY BECOME AN ISSUE IS BILLS ARE NOT COMING IN AT WHAT THEY SHOULD. PREMIUM RATE TEXTS BEING APPLIED. NOT GOOD FOR OUR FUTURE CHOICE OF NETWORK,1
I go bike riding and struggle to get a signal when out on my bike along the Merseyside river front.Worried that the same thing could happen if out in the countryside.,1
"Good reception when needed is most important. SK8 3TL IS 1 bar at best.Id replied no issues in the area and try switching to 4G, 1 bar at 4G is what I get. My wife also has the same issue so no point in trying sim in another phone. SK8 3TL is just poor coverage.",1
"I have no online facilities, It is too difficult to get support from id mobile . I need to be able to phone a help line to speak to someone if I have a problem with my phone, as I can’t search through a website!",1
"Good price but loads of missed calls, voicemails sometimes come through a day or so later. Coverage pretty good, overall good generally for what I need.",1
"When i make phone calls and have to give numbers out the person at the other end cant hear.....just numbers, conversation ok.The help option is useless so camt get to the bottom of the problem.",1
"The internet reception can be very patchy. On recent holidays to Scotland and the Med, while my wife (using the same model phone) was able to access the internet, I could not get reception. This has happened a few times in different places and I am seriously considering changing providers.",1
Got repeated emails informing me it was time to upgrade my phone. However on trying to so and swap my package i was informed it was a 60 wait. Will be changing suppliers when contract now ends.,1
"Although I live in London (only 4 miles from Trafalgar Square!), the ID Mobile signal is often very poor in my house, and street.  It's similar to what I would expect somewhere remote, like the Scottish Highlands.  Not very impressed.",1
Mostly fine but still concerned that someone managed to get through your security system identifying as me to order an E-SIM some months ago and on that basis got into my online bank account with a view to fraud. The fraud was rectified by my bank but caused me to lose some confidence in ID Mobile.,1
There is lots of places i go where i get no signal st all i think this is very poor  for the size of your company  and will be leaveing  when my contract is due,1
There is no phone number to contact. Online communication is helpful but not meet all needs. Some needs cannot express online and need someone to talk.,1
ID Mobile don't give the same deals to existing customers that they do to new customers. You have to phone and threaten to switch to another provider to get a good deal.,1
Like the price and the amount of data.Dislike how often I am unable to make or receive calls even when I have enough signal strength on 3/4/5 g.Sometimes I’m swapping SIM cards to make a call!😡,1
"Like the App when you can get into it. Using the App from my mobile keeps advising ""unable to connect to ID Mobile, Try again"". Tried deleting and reinstalling App but no changes.",1
No roaming in USA so had to buy another SIM card.Impossible to get any advise or talk to someone from ID mobileSignal strength and coverage is very good,1
"Overall it's a really good service. But I have been trying for ages to transfer an account I took out years ago for my daughter.She wants to stay with iD, keep her number and take over paying the account but I'm told this is not possible.",1
"Firstly, the current iD Mobile app, which replaced a perfectly good one about a year ago, is very poor. Owing to a technical fault, it deletes the record of the registration / biometric setup process when the app is closed, so I have to re-register every time I open it. Also, the data usage graph is confusing, there is no indication of how many minutes of calls I've got left, and the details of my plan aren't given (they only appear on the bills).Secondly, while on a Channel crossing to France, the phone logged on to a non-UK and non-EU network without warning and I was charged for roaming beyond the permitted areas: very poor indeed.",1
Coverage at home is 5G full signal but at work in Chelmsford it’s barely one bar of 4g and sometimes it’s just 3G which is annoying. Not sure why this is but on the whole the coverage is fine.,1
It would be nice to actually speak to a  person rather than just a automated service. On the very few occasion I have managed to get through it's been extremely difficult to actually navigate to the department you require and the call is ended simply saying try the app. I've experienced difficulty in  communicating due to  language barrier from some of the  staff at the call center. If this occurs it may nice to be transferred to another colleague who can help.On the question of Date of experience I unfortunately can not submit a date as I've give up trying to call I use the app which again does not give you a option to call should you need it. Very frustrating from the customer that you don't offer this as a service provider. As a customer the satisfaction is some what disappointing..,1
"I don't have very good connection for my area and where I work, across south and west Wales 😞Thankyou for quick response with suggestions, much appreciated idmobile",1
"After a system update,  my phone stopped working.  Apparently the update made changes that were not compatible with my phone.  No notification was given to me and I had to get a new phone.",1
MMS is very expensive but apart from that the contract price is very low.However... what's the point of unlimited mobile data if it's slower than a dial-up modem 🤨,1
I couldn’t get to my voicemail whilst on on holiday in Cyprus.Why does voicemail insist on reading out the long number instead of saying who the message is from?Why isn’t the first option on voicemail to delete the message?,1
"I don’t like that my monthly cost is more than advertised, I can’t send photos to friends or respond to certain text messages from for example my local council confirming no change on our electoral status without you charging me.  Wont be renewing my contract.",1
My phone calls to and from me are never very good..my contacts break up and I break up to them...when travelling in Europe I can never get or receive calls???My husband has his contract with you and never gets any problems 🤷‍♀️,1
My only concern about ID Mobile is that I lose reception on my phone quite a bit and need to go to specific places in the house to get a good reception,1
Phone keeps cutting out during call  and we had to practically talk twice plus the other caller couldn't hear us and these were mainly local calls. we thought it was something to do with the network,1
"Since you up dated the ID mobile app I havnt been able to log in keeps saying don't recognise my phone number very frustrating as I used the app alot to check thingsAlso not happy you can't talk to anyone on the phone about anything anymore when you need help to sort the app ,online support is again very frustrating don't understand what your asking I've been customer for many years and because of this thinking of changing as want an app on my phone that works to use and to be able to speak to a human on the phone if any problems",1
"Difficult to talk to a actual person if you have problems which I did, my phone keeps saying not registered on this network when I try to phone out this occasionally happens",1
"All of the family are with ID mobile and are all very pleased with the cost/service.  The only reason that I have given it 3 stars is due to the fact that you can't change your mind until after a set period of time.  I purchased a Samsung (always been happy with Samsung) but after my daughter had an iphone I realised how good the quality of their photos was and tried to change, unfortunately you can't until your 2 year contract is virtually up.  It's a shame, I didn't want to leave ID mobile so you wouldn't have been losing my custom but I still couldn't change.",1
"I have not been satisfied with your services lately. very often it is very slow, but sometimes there is no internet at all. I don't understand how it can be, because I see that there is a signal but no internet, this has happened many times before. So now I'm thinking of looking at a more serious company.",1
"I bought a prepay SIM for free roaming in Europe. It was easy to set up, and good value for money.However they ran a hard credit check against me which affected my credit score, even though it was for only around £5 a month.Also when I wanted to cancel they still charge another 30 days which is unreasonable. Furthermore the plan can't be paused so I could only use the SIM once.",1
The Internet speed is slow and every time I check the service status in my area it is saying working on some issues and currently some maintenance is being carried out in the area.  Well I don't believe that. Generally the speed is slow ant that is just an excuse.,1
"My SIM card suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls, which was very inconvenient. It was difficult to contact ID mobile and the chat bot was very annoying. Finally had a live chat with agent but very slow. Hopefully a new SIM will be delivered soon",1
"I'm not really happy, the signal is awful, whether it's at home or away. Never have I experienced this as much as I have with iD Mobile.Also when I go to make a call, it doesn't ring on my phone, as if it's not connecting. But when it's been my Mum I've phoned it rings her end.Never ever have I had this.I can be on a call then all of a sudden it disconnects, which is very annoying if it's a call that's took me ages to get through too!So really not happy with this.",1
I have been ID Mobile customer for some years and always found them value for money but since they updated their App I have been unable to access it or get access to my bills. Support and customer complaints have not been any help even though very apologetic and polite.Note. Recontacted today and somehow they have managed to fix the issue with the app that wasn't working yesterday. Pity it took over 6 months.,1
Every time I went out of the country to places that were supported I could not send messages on WhatsApp of I message which was what I was told that I would be able to do and I was continuosslt running out of data so I had payed my monthly bill and at the start of the month I lost all of my data this happened multiple times!!,1
id mobile are a well priced provider but signal coverage indoors is dreadfull so most of the time iam usung wifi calling that is included thankfully but the so called 5g coverage not so much good luck in your area 4g works out side ok,1
"The mobile reception around our home is terrible, no matter how much I complain it seems nothing is being done to sort this black spot we have.We also find your system of different email addresses for each mobile number we have with you very difficult to manage.You seem to have a very strict credit application criteria with little or no helpful comments to say why the mobile contract has been rejected.",1
Overall reasonably happy although there are still times when I can't access data without being connected to wifi. Usual trick of turning off wifi on mobile doesn't work in these occasions which is quite freustratijg,1
"Signal keeps randomly dropping out mid call. This is down to 3 mobile who are the carrier. It used to be fine when I had a 3 contract (same phone) and then as expected OK with idMobile (MVO) for a few years. Now drops the call occasionally.>Reply from iD Mobile>An hour ago>>Hey there, we're very sorry to hear you're having >issues with coverage.>>Please take a look at our coverage checker, which will >show you what your signal strength should be like in >your area, for all of 3G/4G/5G, for both indoors and >outdoors.>.idmobile.co.uk/ help-and-advice/coverage#coverage-info>>Furthermore, please take a look at our network >partner Three's network status checker, which will >show if there is any maintenance or performance >upgrades going on in your area.

Of course I do. I was a telecoms software engineer for many years including mobile. The reason why the calls now drop out is because in this area, 3 have removed a number of older transmitters replacing them with fewer 4G/5G transmitters resulting in more fringe areas (grey spots) until they start to backfill. I live in a small market town close to a major new city and not some rural back area. A similar and well documented situation existed when t-mobile merged with Orange to become EE and EE removed far more duplicate transmitters that they should have done basing this on computer modelling coverage rather than actual real world coverage. OFCOM became involved and EE had to fix it.  Going back to idmobile and 3 , I am expecting (and hope) this call drop out problem to substantially reduce once 5G covers this area. Or more to the point, 3 commission the currently idle masts. Having said all that, I was a direct customer of 3 for many, many years but moved to idmobile roughly for the same price. Idmobile have a far superior and easy to use website, data-rollover, and inclusive international roaming covering much of the world that 3 used to cover. I have no intention of cancelling my idmobile contract.",1
Poor 4G service in many places in UK but a much better signal in the places I've been to in Europe. ID mobile say they are working on improving 4G but they probably are not.,1
Right level of communication eg good customer care and no over selling. Unfortunately service cover can be patchy especially when im at home. I need to go to certain areas of my house to be sure of getting a good enough signal to make/recieve calls which is annoying. Good product range and price.,1
"Had a problem texting my wife who is also  an ID mobile customer for weeks, got fed up going to CarphoneWarehouse as they didi nothing to help. So, all our communications are being done on Whatsapp, BUT, occasionally I forget to Whatsapp, and text and they go through.",1
"Signal here in West Cornwall is not brilliant. Also texting is annoying, especially to my wife, or anyone else on an I phone, as the network seems confused as to how the message is sent. i.e keeps trying to send via Wi-Fi instead of ordinary SMS. iD Mobile is good at dealing with spam texts though which is good.",1
"Inability to have a family account.I have set up accounts for myself, my wife and two children with ID but cannot have one account to manage all of us. It makes it very difficult to have four separate email addresses to access their accounts and manage the spend/usage, especially for the children.",1
"Firstly your signal coverage and call quality is very good, including abroad. Also the ability to use my phone as at home whilst abroad is very useful. On a day to day basis I'm very pleased.Where I feel let down by you is twofold. If ever I need to contact you I'm unable to talk to anyone. I'm forced to use your chat system. This makes me feel somewhat disconnected from you and being kept at arms length. I'm sure it's vastly cheaper for you, but I question it's customer service.Also I recently changed my call package with you to a cheaper one. This suited my needs and my pocket. I was told that there was no way I could keep my existing number. One I had for over a decade. Being able to miraculously keep while swapping services providers, including yourselves! I've also noticed you can magically keep your original number if you upgrade or swap to your heavily promoted offers. Having to change my number has caused some amount of stress and I'm still not 100% sure everyone has my new number even now.",1
"Massive data allowance for a small price, but comes with issue where some major towns, e.g Keswick have phone coverage but no data which for a tourist spot isn’t good enough.In regards to the reply, I have already checked the websites mentioned for issues and none are reported. I have used the community board for help but I get the same response from there.",1
"Coverage. I’m having issues with coverage. I’m in Cornwall, coverage on the main roads seems ok but as soon as you move away from arterial roads the signal will just about disappear. I’d have thought that Three your provider would have been able to get a better network coverage. It doesn’t appear to have gotten better in the last eight years since I was last in Cornwall.",1
"ID Mobile gives fantastic offers, they would do much better with working on communication, training and admin staff.2 weeks ago I did but a sim only plan on line, easy and swift process. in 1-2 days I received the email with transaction number and instructions how to port the mobile. I followed the instruction and provided my PUK code for porting my number from previous provider to ID Mobile, what happened after was very disappointing.As per the emails Sim was sent, No tracking number, Sim was sent by “2nd Class Royal Mail”, Porting the mobile followed on the day specified while the Sim Card never arrived!!This did result in me loosing the mobile service completely. I am a surgeon and I do on-calls which mandate that the hospital reaches me via mobile. Was not very pleasant scenario.I tried to communicate with ID Mobile, they have this frustrating form of AI assistant that loops around itself and never gives you answers but provides you with links for forums. After 2 more days I managed to “Chat” to a customer service on line. The lady advised that I need to go to “Currys” as ID Mobile is a trade name for Currys, She advised to take a photographed ID so they can provide me with a Sim and activate the line with my old number. This looked too easy for me to believe, I had a copy of the chat emailed to me.As soon as I finished work, picked my passport and went to Currys, Exactly what I expected, David at Currys says: Sorry sir, this is very wrong information, I can only give you blank sim and you have to call them. Trying to explain that “There is no one to talk to and no number to help” did not add much to this waste of time conversation.Just to note, the chat service is only available until 18:00 then it gives you automated response.I went back home and fiddles online to find that I can simply do the porting on line via an authentication code that they will send to my mobile “That I do not have” !!Following some further search and frustration, I managed to get the code via my email I used to purchase the plan !During activation, it gave me at least 15 times message that “Something is wrong, try again”. Following 20 attempts, I got a different message that this sim card was previously activated !!Testing the sim card, It started working. HallelujahConclusion:ID Mobile has not trained its staff to know what are they managing or advisingID Mobile is sending important Sims after activation with untracked 2nd class Royal Mail! If someone gets hold of your mobile, may become able to get authentication codes for all your bank accounts..etc. Dangerous practice. Please use a safe tracked serviceID Mobile has a very poor customer service level as it is all on-line but very limited to probably one employee on the other side of the globe !For Customer:Do not port your number until you receive the Sim CardDo not try to communicate with ID Mobile, you will get frustrated and get no where.If you face my situation, Get a blank Sim from Currys, click, lost or damaged sim, for replacement, you will manage to do it online provided that you have registered with them your email.Conclusion:I will see how will the service go, I may buy again from them is phone and net service is satisfactory but I will be very careful to avoid similar situations and loosing my number for 10 days.",1
With id mobile being on the 3 network I expected great coverage but I experience network and call drop outs quite regularly!I left O2 for similar reasons and may try another provider in the future.,1
The data signal keeps dropping the data is also slow. It doesn't matter my location either. There is NO support regarding this problem. Which is frustratingly annoying.Please sort it out with the 3 network.,1
On a trip to France last week my SIM stopped working. Unable to access my ID account to resolve the problem as I could not receive code you were texting me.,1
"Not able to contact anybody who could help me ,keeps saying login details are wrong,just left in limbo ???Update,iD reached out and after explaining the issue it was quickly resolved via a discussion on X which is not ideal but at least it was resolved.",1
the contract price is fine.  but as for international roaming the prices are dreadful with yourselves. Good job I disabled my sim card and just used hotel wifi,1
Don't get internet in some areas and don't get free data roaming on holiday in turkey.. see better deals on website than I am on no customer service to call tried once to change to a different contract and ended up having 2 contracts going should be help for the elderly it's hard to try and change to better contract,1
The problem i have with  ID Mobile is you can't contact or speak to anyone  +the app is absolutely ridiculous to navigate i have been with you for a long time now +normally have to learn to solve any problems or anything that's wrong myself  or ask friends i am currently trying  to cancel  my last contract as I have already started  another one with you I will probably have to stop at the bank then you will contact  me you really need some customer service training in place,1
"I find it odd and very alarming in this day and age, that despite having service indicated on my phone 2,3,4 bars of 4g and unable to connect to the network for a simple phone call. Let alone data for sat nav or other connectivity. Very poor",1
"Having recently moved to ID Ive had no problems until today, when my service has dropped out and I am unable to make calls.  Ive checked and there are no service issues in my area and my phone is compatible. Ive turned flight mode of & on, turned the handset off & on and still no joy.Trying to get assistance is a total headache. The chatbot system is useless. Ive tried to speak to a person but thats not even loading! Very poor service levels, ID.** Updated review to 3* as issue now resolved. Useful for customers to know that messaging via facebook messenger illicits a human response. **",1
Reception was terrible while at Lindisfarne festival last weekend.Zero reception while friends had full 5gNetwork should be improved in rural areas.All good in towns and cities and good value.Thanks,1
Poor signal and unable to make calls or calls drop. Seems to be going worse. Recently been abroad and worked great both internet & mobile calls. Shame UK is not the same,1
"The basic package is ok the price is good,the big problem is the three network the signal keeps going off , I've been with ID almost a year and have lost almost seven weeks of phone use , twice it was off over two weeks solid and never a apology from ID bad very bad customer relations.",1
ID are a great mobile provider.The WiFi calling option which is included in their packages is invaluable. Also rolling over unused Data from one month to the next is helpful.Unfortunately the 3 network is patchy at best and occasionally hopeless in our area. It would be helpful if ID could press the 3 network to improve their coverage.,1
I find it very odd that in a few shops and buildings I get very limited service. I'm aware that sometimes it's down to the construction of these places but surely your service should be strong enough to still give a reasonable connection without cutting out? Perhaps I need to find a more reliable provider?,1
Decent phone and data service. Incredible value for money but customer service isn't great at all. Upgrading or switching to iD can be very painful. Billing/app also not good.,1
"When out of the uk the coverage is terrible, thought it was just my phone that was the issue but my wife is with ID also and we both had major trouble using our devices abroad but friends on other networks worked fine, major issue for us, seriously considering changing supplier",1
"One Issue. When I'm at home, the signal strength is so poor, It's almost impossible to carry out a voice call. I've tried connecting to the home network, but the signal is still ""dropping out"" all the time. All other solutions have also failed. I'm guessing the fault lies with the host network, which I believe to be Three, otherwise I would have given a much lower rating.No other issues.",1
The service is good except in BH6 4 area of Bournemouth. Cannot make receive calls unless you find hot spots.Also we cannot use ID aims in the United States when on holiday which is not good if we have Banking/cards issue as the Bank know our normal phone numbers if we are in trouble and need to call UK.,1
What I dislike is that you are unable to talk to someone over the phone.And could do more to help with traveling to non EU countries like USA and Canada.,1
"The first thing that appears in the app on home screen should be your current data and minutes plan with allowances remaining + Current monthly plan costs and Bill Capping  - not an advert to upgrade.Advert could be replaced by a question/ link buttons for Upgrade options eg ""Need more data?"" or ""Need more Minutes?"" or ""Need new phone?"" .Should also be a link to costs for non inclusive charges for roaming - it will win you customers if you're honest and up front.And why not also sell unlocked phones outright ie not just as part of a contracted bundle?",1
"The phone service & ease of changing contracts is fine, but I don't like the fact that it appears impossible to speak to someone in person if there is a slightly more complicated issue. Yes, there is the live chat function, but those features are not, in my experience, as satisfactory as being able to actually talk to someone.",1
Quite a cheap but poor coverage in my part of the UK and very expensive to use abroad. I purchased a second e-sim to use abroad to avoid ID’d high roaming charges.,1
"The coverage leaves a little to be desired...My wife and I both have the same iPhones - but with different carriers. We can be in the same location, but she gets reception while I, with ID, don't.Yes, they are cheaper - but the cost reduction has to be considered against having proper coverage.",1
Since the software upgrade I was unable to log on to my account for months.  It has been resolved now but so frustrating.  The s/w upgrade was ill thought thru which did a lot of damage.  Going forward if there are no further issues I shall upgrade my review.. Thx,1
"I can't use my phone to make calls from my own house. Neither can my wife (also an ID mobile customer). We have searched your website to try and find out how to report this, but we just get directed to your 'User Forum'. I'm not prepared to spend hours trawling through incorrect drivel to try and sort this - far more likely to change provider tbh...",1
The quality of coverage is not great. My phone is always the first to lose network. But the service is reliable in every other way. The app works and billing is fine,1
"The service is OK. However, it is unfair that customers have to pay more for a IDmobile plan directly when Mobiles.co.uk offers cashback for the same plan.Why not reward loyal customers!Ps: the IDmobile plan was compared on the same day, only a few minutes apart.",1
"ID are great for a low cost plan with rollover, WiFi calling and roaming. However, if you want to change your handset, they will not allow you to use 3rd party offers, they will only allow you to keep your number if you upgrade with them (usually at a higher price).",1
"I have had a constant battle with iD about why I can't send texts or Whatsapps to 4 or 5 digit numbers such as BBC Sport, TfL, Transport Police etc and I can't attach images to texts. When I complain iD ask me for streams of info about the messages that won't send, then either tell me it's been sorted (when it hasn't) or fail to reply. When I chase it up, they again ask me for stacks of info about the texts. I have given up, which I suspect was what they hoped I'd do. iD is cheap to use but you get what you pay for. I will return to EE. Oh, and reception on iD is awful, even in London. No signal (when my wife is connected to EE) or slow.iD have just replied to the above with the predictable reply they always send. ""Switch on premium setting"" - it is on! ""Change premium cap"" - it is already set to a high level.id's answers are scripted, not tailored for individual customer needs and lazy.",1
"The signal in the UK is hit and miss - just spent a week in the Malverns with minimal signal - so bad, I had to connect with local Wi-Fi or use my wife’s Tesco mobile to piggy-back just to check emails.  Similar issues when roaming in EU for 2 months - poor signal, no roaming in Switzerland.  Thankfully wife’s Tesco mobile saved the day yet again.",1
The lack of USA roaming is an issue they have 50 Countries but not USA. I rang to see if there was a bolt on package and there is not. The operator did offer my PAC code to switch providers...did not feel valued,1
Coverage for data services seems not to be as good as other monile operators. My wife is with vodafone and her data services usually work in locations when my ID phone doesn't work.,1
The prices are great but the coverage lets it down. I know it's supposed to work off a bigger network but many times I have poor signal. Rarely do I get 5G and it's a new Google pixel phone,1
Price is great. Amount of data great. But coverage seems to be getting worse. Sat in the same place I used to get 5g I occasionally get 4g or even H. When abroad it seems to always automatically connect to the worse option. Whilst the wife's O2 is regularly 5g abroad. You can then manually change it.,1
"I have no problem with my phone, samsung24 ultra when I'm out and about, however, when I'm in my home I have very little signal although my daughter who has an apple, and is on id, never has a problem wherever she is in the house",1
"As usual, new customers get what was promised. I mean, after some time your internet speeds go down to unbearable. And in this world of today, the internet speed is what matters most. I’m waiting for Black Friday offers from other providers. ID has proven untrustworthy to me. Cheap but sh____.[edit]My residence area is 5G and low speeds have been registered for months. OUTSIDE. Anyway, it doesn’t quite matter if it’s 3, 4 or 5G technology. Speeds are linked to one of those technologies but don’t automatically guarantee the speed. So sorry, Tyler, but the below reply is of little value to me.",1
"Great value for money EXCEPT that I find in busy places my data speed grinds to a halt, even with four or five bars of phone signal! This happens consistently in a few places but not others, so not being able to use my phone just because I've gone somewhere in particular gets a black mark from me, especially given that somewhere else for example, I can have no issues at all? Who knows.",1
Signal in my area is NOT as good as stated. If it wasn't for wifi calling I'd move contracts to be honest. This comment refers only to the signal. The price of the tariff and its rolling data is excellent value!,1
It might be my phone or some other reason but I find the signal coverage could be a lot better as there are quite a few places where my phone loses contact with the outside world,1
I have been with this provider for a long time. Its just gotten unbelievable terrible. You can't get into your account online anymore as keeps coming up errors. The customer support even though talking to real people have confusing answers. I talked to 4 different customer support on the same day and got different information for the same question by all 4 people. Never got my questions answered. I'm leaving this after about 6 years. It used to be good and reasonable now its just a frustrating joke! I'd definitely find a better provider that can actually help and not have to guess what the support is talking about. I've had to ask for a PAC code so I can use the same number.,1
I have been having problems making calls from my mobile and when abroad had no internet connection at all .Finding it really hard to contact anyone to resolve this,1
"Very good in UK and easy to change details, plan, etc., on the app. Marked down as having set up roaming and international well in advance, was not able to use service (send/receive texts, make calls), when overseas.",1
"There are a lot of areas where we don't have reception it is very bad as I can't make important phone calls, text or have access to data. I need this for work. you guys have to sort this out ASAP",1
"The network is great. I have no issues with coverage. The price is good.However, I recently had to try to contact you and although the chat can be useful, it didn't solve my issue. I actually needed to speak to someone.  That is my only criticism",1
ID mobile Signal quality has got progressively worse to the point of thinking about a change of provider.It was ok when I first joined Id mobile but now spend most of my time trying to get a signal. Which is a shame because id  mobile is a great company apart from that. Love the data rollovers and the price is amazing,1
"Well been happy until its time to actually speak about changing my contract to a sim only . I am out of contract . I have been speaking to someone for obver an hour for a simple request . It sounded like a robot as they asked the same questions over and over . I asked a simple question , After almost an hour they said i will put you through to sales team , Then waited over 20 minutes for no one to be there . SO Frustrating to do a simple task . And trying to find the correct way on the app is impossible",1
"Overall the service is good, only tjing can comment on as of late the reception has not been as good, not sure as to why? But it does start customers looking at other avenues, as this is the main service we require a 'reception anywhere' where possible!",1
"Have been a customer for over 6 years now on a rolling 31 day contract so that I can change level of data from month to month, as a when required, very useful as well as data rollover. Sadly, over the last year or so,  I've noticed that signal coverage in some areas isn't what it used to be, shame really as I'm very happy with ID Mobile overall.",1
"Existing customer upgrade offers not good compared to those offered to new customers, poor signal coverage especially out of town, main plus point is that it is cheap and offers EU roaming",1
"The service overall is pretty good. Sometimes though, the signal strength in my area is poor and I have to go upstairs to get a slightly stronger signal in order to make a call. Occasionally a call inexplicably drops out. Generally data availability is good but often slow.",1
"ID Mobile has a tremendous price advantage over its competitors. That comes with some downside however.....the reception is sometimes flaky (inconsistent) and in some areas within central London there is consistently no signal (in spite of trying at 'off peak' times as well as peak.) Right now I have problems using the internet and also the mobile phone...and service often drops out particularly in late-mornings. Also, don't expect realistic help, beyond the usual glossy patting-ourselves-on-the-back missives.....Since, sadly, the modern way is for companies to treat cutomers with little repect, at least ID Mobile is no worse than the rest.So if you want to pay very little, and have only basic needs, then they would be perfect!",1
"The plus points, the price & customer service, both are first class! Now the negatives, sadly the reception in certains areas is poor and the voicemail on an iPhone does not work so you have to call the voicemail number. I would advise checking on the coverage in your area before getting tied into a contract and if that is OK then it is well worth joining ID Mobile.",1
"I'm coming up to end of my current contract term and you keep sending me reminders on new phones,. As a senior citizen I'm looking to reduce my costs everywhere and will take on a SIM only contract next time. My point is that nowhere in the guff you send me does it say SIM only upgrades are only available 24 days before my contract ends. So I ordered SIM only only to find out these were extras not upgrades. They have been cancelled. At time of choosing I am now going to shop around.After seeing your reply, why, when I cancelled orders within 48 hours of placing them and been told by your chat line staff that they had been 'returned and cancelled', and that any payment instructions would also be automatically cancelled, are you still writing to me to tell me that the direct debit is due to start. I have already informed my bank to cancel. You need to teach your staff how to cancel properly. Please note this all relates to new orders placed in July, not my existing deal due to finish around October.",1
"Signup was easy and the sim turned up quickly. Uses the Three network in the UK so coverage is decent. App allows you to accurately track costs and data usage. Reason for 3 stars is due to terrible coverage overseas. Was not able to get any signal, even in big towns and cities in Europe",1
"Despite wanting to notify ID that I wanted to cancel my contract in order to ensure I didn't continue paying for my phone having paid the 24 monthly repayments this month, the person on 'chat' incorrectly insisted I had to wait until the day after the 2 year contract date. My contract reflected 24 days before the end date, but she argued that was incorrect!",1
"ID mobile used to be one of the best value SIM only deals on the market but they seemed to have now fallen behind a bit in the value for money stakes with a lot of newcomers to the market offering better deals.I also have not been overly impressed by the coverage, while it seems fine in larger cities out in the countryside the coverage is 'patchy' They use the three network. My partner who uses another network did not lose signal on their phone on any of these occasions. I've also had issues at some places where you wouldn't expect such as some of the areas in/around Heathrow airport with no signal.Finally although they include free roaming across the EU watch out for countries that are not in the EU (but still in Europe) as they are not included. A good example being Switzerland which many other companies include in their free roaming but ID mobile does not.",1
"impossible to get any info, any support, anything, from anyone at ID Mobile once the [VERY COST EFFECTIVE] contract is on. On the other hand, would you wish to purchase more / buy more / upgrade, they are very efficiently responding.",1
"I seem to be living in, and visiting far too many places where I either have a minimal signal or even none!This is not a date issue, it’s a lot of the time.Too rural in Lincolnshire I guess?",1
"Back in April we lost all service for 5 days. When I complained I was informed that work was being carried out as part of the 3G switch off. Since then we have never had ""full"" signal coverage within the Town that I live in. Very disappointed with the outcome. Prior to the work I  always had 4 bars on the phone signal strength, now it is often only 2. Hardly an improvement in service.",1
I live in Norfolk and I quite often do not get a very good signal and sometimes my calls keep breaking up which is very frustrating as I haven't got a land line,1
Confusing and difficult to get my revised package. You cannot have a quick conversation with a human to make sense of it.But...all in all happy with iD.,1
"On Saturday 13th July all day and early Sunday morning, 14th July, I had no signal so I could neither make or receive a phone call. This has happened before on a number of occasions.",1
"Recently switched from O2 to ID, had ended sim contract and ID offering great price- received my sim and it wouldn't work at all- customer service not helpful until the 3rd time when the agent sent me and ESIM and now it seems to be working alot better. Great app-able to monitor use and amazing price saving me 10 a month from my old provider! Would have given more stars if the switch over had of been straight forward",1
"It appears almost impossible to talk to a real person! Where has the customer service gone? I am a non tech person and find your service, to be polite, not very good.",1
"ID Mobile is very good. The problem lies in the network provider it uses, Three! I live in Wilmslow and use my mobile for work. I have never had a problem with the other network providers I have used in the past (O2 and Vodafone). However, the coverage/call quality on Three is little short of appalling and only 4G at most is available! Beware!!",1
"Id mobile is cheaper than most,offers very much the same as other networks,only draw back is it uses 3 network who claim a massive coverage but I find it a below average service,most days I only get 1 bar,but as they say you get what you pay for",1
I like the roaming charges.Some of extra charges eg certain numbers (033)do not agree with.Non internet help/service is poor. not suitable for someone like me (pensioner/non technology savvy)Hardly ever see written bills records of use/charges.,1
Have been with iD for 4 years now and not had an issue with them until just having purchased a new phone. At no time was I informed that there was no way I could keep my old number as it was deemed I had 2 accounts and you can't change a number from one account to another in the same company,1
"Virtually impossible to use my mobile abroad. I've had trouble in France, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cape Verde and Sri Lanka.I've coped by using whattsapp in ordercto make calls ( using the hotel wifi only) but banking is a major problem as I can't get One Time Passwords.",1
"Prices are brilliant, but the signal has gotten worse over the last year. I travel all over the UK and the signal isn't really good anywhere. All the family have ID via different mobile manufacturers and none of the signals are good.",1
"I would like to have kept my old plan, but bought a new phone.  But I was told this plan would be better.  Not really, my last plan had 100gb of data which I could roll over any unused allowance and add to the new monthly allowanceI which could be used in full when travelling in Europe.  My allowance now is capped at 30gb in Europe on the unlimited data plan. Very disappointed with advice.",1
I used to receive monthly statements. I haven’t for quite some time. The phone signal is weak (1 bar outside) and connection to many top sites including yours can only be accessed via WiFi. I feel phone/mobile data suppliers are not doing their job effectively in putting pressure on mast owners to keep their infrastructure efficient enough for consumers to use reliably. Bar these issues you would have had a higher star rating.,1
"First of all, I’ve had excellent coverage and service with ID mobile as my provider, so there’s nothing but praise for that, but the customer service is SO difficult. You get wildly inconsistent information from one person to the next and it can take hours to solve a simple problem! I’m trying to end my contract early and I’ve been given a range of different costs and different information from one person to the next. How can they all differ so much?? I wouldn’t mind but I’m not even leaving ID, I just want to move to a rolling contract and they make it stupidly difficult to do so!",1
"Was VERY happy with original deal,Until I got a second sim for my daughter who ported her number and now I cannot see, amend or add to my account for billing / maintenance.It works and they are taking the payment   BUT...Automated help system is NAFF,Unable to get real HELP..... FROM A PERSON !!!!*** finally sorted the issue after talking to a person (family member) but still took ages and few attempts, Other than the support being fully automated the sim service is good ****",1
Took a long time to sort out a problem I had with my phone. The agents in Curry’s where I was sent one of them was useless. Fault finally passed onto tech team who sorted it straight away. Why that couldn’t have been done initially is a mystery,1
"When I tried to contact you via telephone for an urgent matter, no human to speak to. This is a major downfall of this Company. Not very good customer service.",1
It's my personal opinion that the coverage is not wonderful and several interruptions are very annoying.Would definately have to consider a different provider when contract ends unless of course things improve,1
"I inadvertently changed the agreement on one of my mobiles and was unable to revert to its original agreement. I tried emailing iD Mobile but got no response. It was not a lot more money, but I was happy with the existing deal. I accept it was my error in making the change, but would have liked the opportunity to cancel. My email to iD Mobile which was not answered did request cancelling the order.",1
Good - price for low use phoneBad - was told I would be able to see both phones on my account when I got an additional sim but seems you have to access account by app now.  As neither phone is in my possession I am stumped.Very bad - sim doesn't work in old Doro phones.  This wasn't clear before I got it so useless for the elderly relatives phone I'd bought it for.,1
"Good competitive price with lots of useful regular information sent. However, roaming do not include all EU countries, like other mobile networks. Also, minimal reception in some towns just 20 miles from London.",1
A few days ago our phone stopped being to make or receive calls.  Nothing on the website covers this!  Luckily we have a local Carphone Warehouse.  There are telephone numbers online for there but they do not work.  We went there and member of staff seems to have fixed the problem.Your website and Chat are pathetic!,1
I was told to contact them to activate my replacement SIM.  They only provide online chat support and often don't understand your difficulty/question.  I was told I would need to go on their app to complete the activation but every time i entered info and clicked on 'continue' a box popped up 'oops something went wrong'.  Been trying now for over an hour.  Went back on live chat and they didn't understand my problem.  In the end I said 'I want to speak to someone'.  I'm in a 45 minute queue now.  When I did finally get to chat with someone and they were struggling to resolve the issue they cut me off. Very very frustrating so I will change providers when my contract ends.,1
I’m very disappointed that when I recently had a short break in Cornwall I had no signal whatsoever. Vodaphone is the only way in Cornwall. What happened to mast sharing??,1
"I’m afraid after twenty years with another companies network I chose to move because of an offer, it seems this was a mistake, the reception from I.d. is very poor in the area I’m in at the moment which is LA 6 1AD and I spend half of the year here, I have three contracts with I.d. and unless coverage improves I shall be moving on when the contracts end.",1
I have 2 different sim only deals with you one for myself and one for my dad. Sadly my father has passed away and I cannot contact you to cancel his plan.I can't just cancel the direct debit either as I don't know which one is linked to dad's and which is mine.It's totally impossible to contact you by live chat or any other way.This disappoints me. The plan us excellent and does everything I ask for but when there's a problem I just can't get it sorted,1
"Your ‘survey’ people are hopeless. Tried 3x different but valid email addresses to enter the prize draw. All were rejected. Had to choose ‘no’ to entering. You need to be more careful who you get to set these surveys. Very poor, ID. Very poor.",1
I needed to change my email addressIt proved to be almost impossible  very frustrating  i gave up so many times i i even went to a currys store to see if they could help but no they couldnt help!!! All new codes were sent to old emailBring back a person to talk too it would have been sorted in 5 minutes,1
I travel to North Yorkshire quite frequently to a caravan park-and my service is terrible. I can text or call first thing in morning and late at night and I have no reception in between them times. If I needed help I wouldn’t be able to reach anyone. We don’t have Wi-Fi but my mobile data can’t be used.when I was using a different network this didn’t happen. At home in the north east I have no issues with data,1
Took out the contract with a new phone and network reception has been good. Customer service good as well but only three stars because you have to record your own message you can’t use a pre recorded version like most networks. As a small business owner I prefer a pre recorded one,1
"Overall, it's a great price and saving me a fortune that O2 were taking feom me each month, just when I researched coverage, I was assured I'd have 100% coverage where I live, but very often I have nothing, which is quite frustrating as I rely on it for everything. But, that said they're a really good set up and easy to use",1
Lack of people contact. Inflation costs on  phones that have not been subject to cost increase for ID. Excuse to charge more than agreed priceCURE - leave ID at end of this contract,1
"I have been with ID Mobile for a number of years, very happy except for the very miserable experience using their live chat service to try and resolve an issue. Customer Service  is now 100% online , my chat wait time was tedious and difficult to engage with, the advice given was incomplete.",1
I canceled  my contract and paid my bills via direct debit today a received a final demand saying i owed£27.18  i went online thinking this was my final bill to pay it and an automated voice saying i owe nothinggoodbye and hung up.What's going on with them ?.,1
My signal is awful has been for a few weeks now. Can't Google anything as it times it's self out. It used to be good so don't know what's going on. But I love the cost of my plan. Any data I don't use gets carried on so you always get what you pay for,1
"Cannot get online abroad; it’s not my phone because I didn’t have this problem with EE, and have used your advice for phone settings, but it makes no difference. Otherwise, great service but sorry, because of the overseas issue, you’ll be losing my custom.",1
I would have given five stars except for the fact that the app doesn't seem to work.Thanks for your reply - sounds like I need to re-register for the new app. But the app won't let me re-register only option is to sign in and when I do that it says something went wrong....,1
"iD Mobile offers basically everything you'd want. EU Roaming, WiFi Calling and good Customer Support for great prices.The problem for me however is the Three network they're running on. When connected, 5G can easily reach speeds up to 500 or even 1000Mpbs, but in Central London there are many spots where there is no connection of the network is too congested. Your phone might show 4G+ of 5G, but you won't actually have any internet.For me it's more important to have a reliable connection than insane speeds, so for this reason alone I switched to O2",1
"Hello, I have a sim from you for over a year. I am no longer in contact, but I stayed  because you have a very low subscription price and because I have no problems in roaming. But the signal is weak most of the time, often if I don't have wifi I can't use the internet at all. That's why I have another phone on another network so I can use it when I don't have signal from you.",1
Was very satisfied until trying to register onto the new app. That’s why the 3stars. But for the hassle involved you’d have rated highly. Don’t understand why existing customers information wasn’t moved across by I’d.,1
"The price is good, but where I live LN11 7 the signal level is low and the Internet speed is low 1-2Mbps. My wife has Talk Talk service and get 20-24 Mbs.",1
"The set up of account, app and communication is good.  The most annoying and infuriating thing is billing.  If you DD is missed they cancel it - does that makes sense to me no.  Secondly your phone is cut off and blocked after 2 days..  So this is where it is so infuriating because you can't make a payment as a result!!  online because you can't authenticate it with your banking app because you're blocked, you can't pay with the app because you're blocked, and you can't pay by calling 7777 as you still need to approve the payment via the banking app which won't open! You then can't transfer banking funds as you are blocked! I mainly use apps for banking.  I spent literally a couple hours of my day sorting it out.  I get my payment was late hands up but what if you were sick or something two days is just too soon and for this reason I don't think I want to renew my contract again. Apart from that coverage etc is good.  Plan went up in price a few pounds too after one year in.",1
On a whole I find ID fine to use. My big problem is the new Website. Not easy to use to find information about account and contract details. It's just aw well that people working in their stores understand and are very helpful. No idea why they changed the old site which was easy to use. If it ain't broken don't fix it.,1
"International data does not work,  despite being online with a customer service agent for half an hour or more before going to Montenegro,  the data did not work- I was assured repeatedly it would - had to buy an International E sim while out there, very disappointed",1
"I gave 3 stars because I often have a problem getting a signal.This means that phone calls sometimes drop out, so whilst I like the phone, I cannot rely on the service.",1
"I've rated 3 stars for the simple reason of the terrible signal I'm receiving, it's not just where I live as it's the same everywhere I go, a few of my friends are on ID and they too are having the same issueI believe its down to 3 mobile services as ID use their signal, 3 have always been a dinosaur in the mobile connection world and probably nothing will ever changeAfter being with ID for a few years, I'm now considering switching over to another provider",1
"Signal very poor. Told I can't be heard at times or signal is breaking up, when I'm in my own house. Never had such issues when I was with Vodafone. Also get a message telling me I have reached my data limit when I have LOADS left. However, tied into iD contract. Couldn't really recommend iD due to the issues I have. Happy to have feedback or support from iD.",1
Cos it so hard to chat to real person without having to jump though task to get the chat to real person. Your webpage is tearing as you try to find support to chat to real person no great overall,1
It would be nice to actually see what you have used in your app ...if it's there I cannot see it ..ie if I've used 25gb of my data allowance I want to see it,1
Sometimes in London in Square Mile forced onto 3G network.No signal in London Bridge station.Roaming is very slow to connect and lose signal often.Very limited 5G,1
Cheap contracts. You cant speak to anyone on the phone though so be prepared to wait for absolutely ages for responses on their live chat (I'm currently speaking to someone on the live chat...there's a min of a 5min wait between each answer. Painfully slow).,1
"Some of the best prices tariffs available, haven’t seen anything as competitive although I do experience more dropped signal than my previous provider.",1
"Since upgrading I am unable to access my account, and unable to use the app.Also the signal has deteriorated, but that may be since G3 has been switched off? I don't know...Prior to the upgrade I would have given 5 stars.",1
"I hate the new ID app! The old one allowed me to add a ""just in case""  ""shock-proof"" £5 margin to my monthly bill.  Then If I made calls to abroad or to premium rate numbers  or used extra data  then it would be taken out of the 5 pound. Now I can only pre-pay for extra data ( which I may not use) or extra minutes ( which again I may not use). And I will get charged  even if I don't use the extra data/minutes.Badly done ID!And I hope your cover abroad has improved. Last time I was abroad even after calling ID I could not make any calls . I never had that problem with Vodafone.",1
I would like to contact you by telephone - not online - I recently tried to change my phone and I was unable to go further with it as curry’s said my mobile no didn’t match your records - I wanted to speak to a person not via online,1
"It works ok so far use in my IPad while roaming.Tried today to login  get to success, then it asks for phone number etc won’t accept it and goes back to square one.Tried help not very helpful! Given up",1
The value for money is great as well as the coverage. My one gripe however is with billing. It seems like they take the money for the billing whenever they like as long as it’s ‘around’ a certain date which isn’t helpful when people have other bills to pay and money going out. Also the live customer service chat is awful as you have to talk to a robot before you can get through to a person and the chatbot never seems to grasp the issue at hand.,1
I have been really pleased with ID mobile buy using the phone/Internet internationally could definitely be better. There isn't even an option to use the phone when we've been in the USA and Canada.  We'd be happy to buy US usage but they don't offer that.Also trying to get in touch with anyone is impossible. Given up many times.It's good value for money but there are downsidesWe would look to move when we have the time to investigate alternatives.,1
The actual product from ID Mobile is very good. They fell down on customer service when the only option was to ask an online forum of customers. I still believe after chasing 6 referral bonus payments that never turned up without extensive chasing  that they offer this dangled carrot and deliberately make it difficult to claim so you give up,1
I’m very pleased with how you handled things in the lock down situation bu I have just finished a holiday in Australia and needed to use my phone for medical purposes and couldn’t every time I did I had a text telling me the cost so I am can’t understand why you don’t do Roming,1
"Fantastic Price, but unfortunately the signal is not the best in a lot of areas. Hence my new mobile is slower on the internet than my friends and I don’t always get a reception too. That is the only downside of using ID mobile and I am looking at changing to a stronger more reliable signal for my area.",1
"iD Mobile piggybacks on the 3 network. When the services is good, it's very good. Too often, however, when it's poor, it's very poor. Poor signal and slow speeds are not uncommon.",1
Overall am happy with iD but when there is a problem it is frustrating that it’s so difficult to actually speak to anyone to resolve the issue. In fact it’s impossible.Also as a contract is about to end and it’s possible to upgrade it’s difficult to sort out when conflicting dates and information is given out. Annoying,1
Not a great signal but three to blame for this and need to improve.Don’t like charge for sending pictures via text. Meant to be unlimited and we are paying more for it. OK but could do better.,1
Great service really good internet only reason for 3 stars is that if you got any issues you can't actually speak to a human being I lost my ild number because of this,1
"Price attracted me, weird mix of very basic app, 90s looking web portal and community support. Queuing to register and login ????? Whats is that about, bill you before sin arrives, PAC transfer problem ( might be my fault ) and est of 5 days for PAC transfer ( Nah mate) seems ridiculous.",1
"If I was writing my review 6 months ago, I'd give them 6 stars if I could. Never an issue, got 5g service before a lot of my friends on other providers, and always got fantastic service. Unfortunately in the last 6 months or so we've had around 3 full day outages, with very little communication by the company on sites such as Twitter, other than a generic 'bear with us'. They've also recently updated their mobile app and customer web portal, which has been a farce to say the least. High wait queue times and very limited availability at the moment. I'm still a customer and hopeful they can turn it around. I also payed off my mobile phone, but they continued to charge me for both my phone and data plan... feel a bit robbed.",1
"The new app is not as good. Before their ""upgrade"" i could add a 5 pound buffer zone which was shock-proof, in case I called a premium number or called abroad. Then it would be taken out of the £5. Now you have to pre-buy a certain number of minutes which I may end up not using . Badly done ID mobile!Also mobile coverage abroad used to be terrible. I only hope it has improved. Even though you were supposed to be able to make calls, it never worked. Let's see if it works in 2024!",1
"Sign up, the phone, price and plan are great.. but god forbid you want to use their app, customer service or view a bill.I have been with ID for around 6 months now, Contacted support on 3 occasions and each time I have had a tragic experience and just cancel the chat without any result. I have had to ask agents if they are real as they are copy and pasting badly from a script that makes no sense.I can barely use the app or website for errors, every bill I have is in symbols and Wingdins font.. I have asked support about this "" we are doing mantinence at the moment thats the issue"" ... then "" it will be fixed at some point"" .The bill to leave them for another provider varys also, some days it is higher and lower than the last.If it works, great. If you need support.. then don't bother. I want to leave.",1
The  company service is excellent. Unfortunately the coverage in YO14 is patchy with message breakup and occasional cutout. Looks like I will need another provider but sorry that this is necessary.,1
"It seems that ID Mobile have recently implemented a queueing system to access their website where you are given an estimated time when you can enter the site. For customers who want to download their invoices each month and for other general use, what a ludicrous means of saving on bandwidth, hence cost, because this is it's purpose. Most customers don't want to have to wait and they deserve better ID Mobile!",1
"I waited six months before writing this review as I took out a great value contract with them on a Google pixel 8. On the plus side the amount of data I get is brilliant and the phone cost was exceptional when factoring the overall price for the duration of my contract.I did carefully check the coverage checker at both my home and work location before ordering the phone but I have been disappointed with the coverage and speed of the connection. In addition I regularly drive on business and the phone does not seem to connect to a 4g or 5g signal easily, instead regularly showing no signal or basic calls. It's not a phone issues as I downloaded a separate Vodafone e sim to test a few long journeys.In summary I guess you get what you pay for, I'm happy with my Google pixel and hope the network improves or they consolidate with another network. If not I will be moving to an alternative network once my contract expires.",1
"Just started with ID mobile DATA  Works ok my iPad Tried to set up account, not easy especially when I put phone  number they sent me in their long winded process doesn’t recognise it, tried twice , so if it continues to work ok re charges etc. Will leave as is",1
"Very good for data & wi-fi calls over i'net, not good for phone connection, Calls drop out and are difficult to hear. But low cost, so check your coverage for signal.",1
Recommend a friend. I needed to chase my voucher. My friend chased his but months later it still hasn’t been credited.Very disappointing and I won’t be recommending anyone else.,1
"Their website is horrendous, can't find anything. The chat bot is even worse.Their customer service when you eventually get to an agent is okay though, it is a redeeming feature",1
Really really really bad service. Requested phone number swap. Inputted all correct details online. Advised of day and time for switch. Still nothing. Rang to enquire when switch would occur. Advised it would be by 6pm guaranteed. Still nothing.,1
"The prices are very appealing but simply put you get what you pay for - I am in London and my signal is simply appalling, especially when in crowded areas. While my partner who is with Sky is getting full bars of 5G I am suffering with one or two bars of 3G. I managed, hence the 3 stars, but I make this as a warning to anyone thinking of signing up.",1
"I live in a small village where the signal can be a bit on and off, I, at times, have to go outside if I need to make a call. When I'm in or closer to the nearest big town it works a lot better thankfully.",1
"Have decided to give a review after 6 months . Firstly signal is ok most of the time with infrequent drop outs .App , used to work and now just sits there looking pretty . The customer service number on the app sends you to curry’s customer support in South Africa , lovely girl, Sadly wrong company.ID mobile customer service (finally caught up with them in somewhere in Africa ) advised me incorrectly that I had to pay roaming charges when it’s clearly written in my contract that I have 30gb within my available data available for Europe .Loose two stars for bad App and false information.Sadly they need to get their excrement together .",1
"I was getting charged £19 per month instead of the £15 plan I was on. This happened for most of the year. When I queried it and raised a complaint, I don't feel it was dealt with properly.I feel the plan I am on is very good value, but the extra charges apparently were from Sky, which I don't subscribe too.Also, I still, a couple of months on, haven't had a satisfactory response about my complaint. Disappointed!",1
"Poor signal where I live currently and my old address. It's not IDs fault its three, they used to be my fave network as I was a courier travelling the country and always had a signal, but this last 2 years almost has been annoying.  I'm going to give EE a go in September.",1
"I used to be really happy with the service that ID provided but just recently I've been facing lots of little annoyances. The app is no longer working (I'm unable to update to the new one as it won't let me. I either get a) we're too busy at the moment or b) we're having technical issues.Unfortunately, this means that I can't check my data or usage which is vital as I'm now working away from home and my usage has increased a lot (I switched plans only one month ago from 6GB to 50GB).This isn't really ID's fault but their signal in my new work area isn't great, so I looked around and can get better deals with other providers now so it's a no-brainer.Leaving was very simple though and the PAC code was sent almost immediately.",1
"I've been with ID mobile for a while, everything runs smoothly and there ha e been no issues. The reason I've only given 3 stars is that I know they now offer better deals than the one I'm on, but have never offered these to me.",1
"Unfortunately signal in my area was very poor. After dealing with customer service, they agreed to let me go to a different provider without having to pay the fee. I am changing my rate from 1 star to 3 stars due to the support received.",1
Normal have no issues. Great network and package but for the last week the App has been out of use. Need to re register on new app and can't. No way of finding my details only by phoning the hotline. Please sort it out!!!!,1
"I’ve been with ID for years and always been happy with service and price but a couple of months ago I lost signal at work, even outside the building, and it caused me no end of problems not being able to contact or be contacted.  It has not resolved so I have been forced to change to a different provider who uses a different network",1
"I had an account only 2 month and you have changed the login system. The stupid things is to log in, you have to reregister where you ask all the questions that a scammer asks, for example complete password, full name, mobile number etc. My bank only asks partial passwords when they update their system. Partial mobile number etc",1
"Haven't had an issue with my sim nor Internet connection. Obviously it wouldn't work in some areas but overall it's good, sim is affordable and three network too.I'm not happy about the new though. Doesn't tell when my contract is finished and the app wanted me to set up the again even when i regularly open it. Mad. The automated service hasn't got an option to listen to my contract expiry date.",1
"I think you should look after existing customers .I need a new phone but to upgrade is more expensive than if I was a new customer ,think I’ll have to change providers",1
"the Company is fine. the coverage I get in my area (Airedale / Wharfedale) leaves a lot to be desired, and seems to be getting worse over time. I need to use my phone for work, so this needs addressing, and if the Company can't do it, I'll have to move provider.",1
"I don't get a signal in a lot of places, or signal drops out and I have not network at all, need to rescan only to be told no network available for hours at a time.",1
"Generally, iD does what I need so long as I don't need to go onto the website. I never can get it to recognise my password, and when I tried to change my password yesterday I had to wait 2HOURS for the code to arrive so I never could change my password. This is the second time this has happened. I never can get online by logging in. It's very frustrating",1
Have had a number of connection issues since joining. Offered incentive to introduce friends but now only pay after 3 months. No way to speak to anybody. All in all quite disappointing,1
I have always had excellent experienceHowever I think the fees to cancel my contract are a little excessive as I need to do this due to financial issues,1
"I've been with ID mobile for many years now.  I am not an avid phone user so overall it meets my basic UK needs.  However, there are a few things that I would love to see fixed.  1),  The biggest problem for me is the extra charges price cap of £25.  This became a problem to me when my mother fell ill overseas.  I maxed out the extra charges while out of the country, and then didnt have any ability to use my phone when I needed it most.  Just to be clear I've always paid on time and as for the extra charges, I would have paid it up front, but there wasn't any way I could do this either.   2) Every time I make an international call I get a text warning me that it is an additional charge.  There doesn't seem to be any way to turn this automatic text message off.   I make an international call every two weeks so its just become an annoyance.   So I've given it 3 stars for these reasons above.  It could be 5 stars otherwise.1/4/24 Edit:  Have discussed with customer service and have been able to increase the price cap, so I'm grateful for that.  The live customer service agent (once i got past the chat bot) was very helpful.  On this note, it was unnecessarily complex.  I was unable to access live chat from the app, having to go out of the app to find the link. Then having to talk to a bot first.   Not ideal, so whilst one problem was solved, due to the barriers and time it took to get through them, I'm leaving the score at 3 stars.",1
Great value for money & not many network problems but very very difficult to communicate with.So all ok once you’ve set up but if you have any problems you cannot speak to anyone only online chats which keep cutting out!,1
"It's a nice package, but signal strength seriously limits its usefulness.  I cannot make calls from where I live; many places I go have very poor 4g signal.  If I force my phone to go with 3g, the signal improves for phone calls, but data rates fall significantly, and that is my primary reason for having an ID SIM card.",1
"+ Good network coverage, reasonable price- charged for emojis in texts, app is useless and won’t let me update, I keep asking for PAC and you keep telling me you ran into a problem even though it’s my correct DOB in the correct format",1
No feedback on request to block premium deal alert which are charging £1.50 each time. I did not knowingly apply for these text and impossible to stop so reduced capped to nil. Need to make calls to Jersey but can’t till sure not being charged.,1
"Updated app is poor upgrade. Slow to progress through pages the 'Oops something went wrong. try again"" message occurs multiple times. The old app was fine and the mobile service was good.",1
"Experience with IDI am more than happy with the app, is quite easy to use.I have just updated the ID app and now not able to bring up live chat.Being a pensioner I just wish that I could actually speak to somebody and not just message.  It would be nice to have human contact.I appreciate you asking for my feedback",1
It draws you in as seems cheap but doesn't include alot of things my previous provider did so I find I have to be careful how and what I use on my phone now as sometimes my bill is more expensive than my last provider and I'll be honest I'm not sure I'll continue with I'd.,1
"I have struggled when trying  to use my phone abroad .... can't make calls except via WhatsApp when Internet is availablepppp. The phone says it is ready to go, but I never receive a welcome text when I cross boarders.",1
"Generally very happy with the service but wanted to transfer my now older son's account to his own name but can't without losing his number, which he doesn't want to do. As a consequence, will probably have to leave at some point. What a shame.",1
When there is a problem there is no telephone number where you can speak to a member of staff. It is all online. It would be nice to have more person to person contact.,1
"The company offers competitive prices to start with, which is good. However, the price increases annually and I started off paying £23 a month and I am now paying £27.30 a month. As a student I would prefer to be with a network that will keep my price the same for the duration of my contract. Therefore, when my contract is up I will be switching to a provider such as VOXI or Asda Mobile who do not have mid-conract price rises.",1
Mobile coverage often not good.Europe free roaming good but difficult to detail the actual free coverage area when on holidayAdvance warning before charges would be good.,1
"They're customer service is amazing however the actual service, is stupid. When they have planned work in the area, they don't message to let you know (my son has cardiac conditions and on the day the network was down, I couldnt phone the cardiac department from the phone, thankfully we have the landline). Its took more than 4 days to apply a new contract that I still havent had applied to my sim so I'm not too impressed and there is never anyone to actually speak to, it's all via chat which isnt too bad sometimes but sometimes you just need to speak to an actual person, Hoping I get my contract sorted soon as I've been told 2 different dates now. This isn't the first time I've been told different dates either, I was told 2 different billing dates at the start of my first contract with them and had to chase it up.",1
"It’s ok.Positive: it’s a virtual operator.  Nice app to manage account.Negative: cost of extras, ie sending pictures in text messages.  Increase monthly payments every April to maximise their profits.  Hoping this is made illegal soon as its not a fair policy for customers who are on a fixed contract term.",1
I have 3 phone contracts but only one email address so I can only communicate about 1 phone. I have tried to solve this problem by using live chat which is absolutely useless. They really need a phone number so you can talk to someone,1
"Mithers the life out of you with emails most days. The 99° UK network coverage boasted by Three is great, unfortunately I seem to be always in the 1° area no matter where I am. Very dissapointed.",1
I live in West Cornwall but 3 coverage is I’m afraid poor.I am missing phone calls-my son in Sussex often cannot reach me. Internet is difficult to get in many areas where I would like it. No problem with the actual phone though.Had no issues with previous provider.,1
Dislike nothing about the service but very disappointed not to have received the voucher I and my husband were promised as he introduced me to id mobile months ago. Currently neither of us has received the promised Curry's vouchers,1
Unable to communicate with a human! You have docked my usage even though I have not used the monthly quota.Coverage is poor in comparison to other networks only plus is the plan is cheap,1
Normal use in UK is great with good coverage at a reasonable price. Do not appreciate being charged for texts to Europe and Roaming is prohibitive with Switzerland excluded from plan.,1
"I have been with ID for just over six months on a SIM only contract, I have no issue with this service and would recomend them for value and ease of use of their APP. My issue was when I decided to migrate to a 24mth phone contract, I contacted their online agents and after some security checks they confirmed that I could upgrade to the deal I had seen on line. I recieved a phone call directly from them to set the contract up, after all the usual passing over of details the end result was that I did not qualify for the deal because of a financial reason.This is very strange as my credit score is very excellent, they asked if I would consider a cheaper phone and then they might be able to help, this i declined. I went straight to the Apple UK site oredered my phone over 24mths interest free with no issue, very strange how they ID have lost a sale when I know I have no issue getting credit elsewhere.I will still be keeping my ID SIM but just annoying that I couldn't get the phone that I wanted from them.",1
Very reasonably priced but reception is shocking. Have moved from a larger more known provider and have seen a significant drop in coverage for both phone and data. So frustrating!,1
"I like the online app and the fact you can monitor your usage. The monthly spend is competitive and there are no roaming charges when visiting other countries … I love that! The only downside is the internet connection which is not always good … I’m often looking at 1 or 2 bars when I’m out and need my mobile. This could be improved as it’s non-existent, most of the time, in my area.",1
"I am not happy with 3 network, it goes down regular! We will be losing our landlines soon, so I will be relying on my mobiles network! I need a reliable network for people to contact me.",1
Good service and very cheap to use in the UK but no package to be able to use in Turkey or outside Europe. Would really appreciate economical package to be able to add on to use when away (out of Europe),1
"Reasonably priced, good value sim only contracts for my husband and I; but disappointing customer service.  My husband's contract included £45 worth of Amazon gift vouchers 3 months after taking out the contract.  We have not received these vouchers and have not received a reply to a form we completed saying we hadn't received them, nor to an email we followed this up with when we didn't get a response.  Still waiting to hear back.Update:  Following on from iD's response to this review, we have now received our vouchers.  Also, my contract came to an end and I have upgraded it to an even better deal - 100GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts, sim only, for the same price as the old contract, £10 per month.  Excellent value.",1
"Had a smooth transition from Three to iD Mobile, keeping my old number. No issues at all. Downloaded the app and that all worked fine. Logged on in web browser and downloaded a statement. Also easy and trouble-free. All good.August 2024 update:I took out an Id Mobile contract after following a link on their web site and receiving an email promising a £30 amazon gift card. After 90 days, no gift. After chasing it via their agent (Giftcloud) and providing copious evidence, I finally get told ""the ID mobile team has declined the issuance of the reward for your sign up"". No explanation or reason given. Basically I was scammed into taking out a contract.",1
I wish the coverage was better but apart from that I can't fault ID mobile so far as my bills represent good value for money and haven't been raised.  I haven't had to contact them so the rating doesn't reflect dealing with customer services.  I am now reducing by 1 star as their login process has changed - now a multi-click process instead of 1 which uses Google Recaptcha.  I have serious concerns for my privacy with sites that use this.,1
"The network used to be really good now all I get is poor reception, Internet slow, videos buffering. 3 bars at most for majority of the time but the mobile data is pretty dire!! Looking to switch.",1
Setting up took ages as I am a disabled user. The gentle at  the counter in curry’s was gracious and helpful.I struggled to get on live chat and searched unsuccessfully for a phone number to aid.  I took me four days before a relative could sort it out for me.,1
"I love ID usually. However was not happy when bought daughter phone and contract in Aug 22. Discussed cost of various phones at length with agent, because couldnt afford too much but was 18th birthday present. He never advised me that cost would go up with RPI in april so it went from £29 to £34 within7 months andno doubt will go up again this april. Next time i get phone with contract, im going to tesco mobile where price is same for length of CONTRACT because it is a CONTRACT so in my opinion should stay same price",1
"I did not realise I could not send emojis without incurring charges, this is a habit difficult to stop and I keep incurring charges. It seems rude you can't just send a heart for free!",1
"I've just moved from EE to iD. I'm really quite unsure. I went for them because they were recommended on Money Savings Expert. My new sim came through as expected and porting seemed to go fine. However, my phone insisted on retaining the original number of the sim rather than the new number.  That's when things got a bit flaky. Firstly, it's difficult to get through to a human being, they expect everything to be done by bot but their bot didn't understand my problem. The only solution is to go through ""cancel contract"" options. They said that they woudl send out a new sim. I checked that this would have my ported number and they confirmed so. It arrived, I put it in my phone; I switched the phone off and on. Nothing. No signal. I could now enter the correct number in the phone settings but then had to change back to the original sim to get any signal and make calls.Then I sent a web link to my wife and immediately received a text from iD to say that any MMS messages sent would be charged at 55p per message! So if you send someone a picture; a video; an audio message, iD will charge you 55p. Now I understand why the up front price is low...the gauge you elsewhere.I'll see what else the hit me with but I'm half way out the door with them.Then I've had a number of instances where I can hear the person's voice I was calling but they could not hear me.Finally, the reception is quite poor compared to my previous provider.",1
Not always a great reception. There have been occasions when an error alert came up which made no sense. The network also affects the s21 samsung mobile.,1
When you sign on and have to change your existing account you need to have the telephone number of the new telephone number with you up front and with you. You don't provide that immediacy.,1
"I THOUGHT I WAS UPGRADING MY SIM ONLY DEAL,IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WENT THROUGH AS A NEW DEAL, SO NOW I AM PAYING 2 LOTS OF D/D, AND I ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO MY OLD A/C, THESE PEOPLE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH, WHEN I FINALLY DID, THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR CANCELLING THE NEW CONTRACT, UNBELIEVABLE,",1
I was with IDmobile for a quite a while which I really  enjoyed their data roll over.  But recently they are having network issues with the connection which was dropping on daily basis so I decided to switch to a different network.,1
"In the short time I've had this contract after moving from EE the ID Mobile service has been lost, while you have no service or Internet on your phone your also unable to contact support via there App on someone else's phone on another network,The network needs to be improved, in 10 years I've been with Orange then EE I can remember only 1 time I had no service due to a network issueIn 3 months ID mobile has been down twice and its a day long issueWe need another way to contact ID Mobile support when the service goes offline even if its just a recorded message to say why its gone down yet againOther than that when it works its greatAll we ask if for better support",1
Great for paying cheaper prices for newer phones but the connection is shocking I never have connection I'm never able to ring out or anything despite having unlimited texts call and data,1
"Generally good.Would like to see an insurance option. I keep breaking phones, or phones let me down outside of the warranty conditions and I  have to complete the contract with another phone I've had to buy.Also I'm left high and dry with unlimited data that doesn't work in the USA.I'd like to see multiple phone number contract concessions for those with several dependants using phones and contracts I'm paying for.",1
I can't always connect to Internet with my data and sometimes i cant send messages especially to certain number (my granddaughter) very often it says no network connection I wouldn't recommend id mobile sorry,1
"The one thing every customer service department should have is a telephone contact number, using the only way to contact ID mobile is by chat ,which is not acceptable.",1
"I love the tariff. I love the communication about the bill's. I have given 3 stars as our signal is appalling when at home. My husband even bought a new phone in case that was the problem but still the sameI am not sure if it is ID mobile's fault, but there is no way of knowing.  People visiting with other networks have no problem.",1
"I have only gone on line to buy a mobile phone because of the closure of Carphone Warehouse, they were brilliant at sorting my phone deals out and any problems I had.  I cannot easily navigate the ID website and feel there is too much emphasis on information for new customers and not enough guidance for existing customers. I attempted to get a sim only deal as I liked my phone. I wanted to seamlessly carry on with my old number etc.  However somehow I got it wrong.  Eventually after a very anxious hour of trying to find out how to sort the mistake out as I had ended up with two contracts I found a way to get a telephone number to actually speak to someone and registered myself as a vulnerable customer.  Since then I feel so much happier using the service. They helped me with all the difficulties I was experiencing. I am over 70",1
"Coverage over quality.I've been using ID mobile for many years and I have always been on their SIM only monthly rolling contract deals - I have always found them very competitive throughout the years with really good upgrade opportunities.It's been so easy to change my deals, set limits and even order a new SIM - all trough the app. Great experience there, nothing to complain about.Data rollover was genuinely my favourite thing when I first got my SIM with ID. Amazing feature, love it, I would hate to lose it.For voice only I have rarely had issues even in rural Wales - I've had decent coverage & been able to make phone calls and have always thought that the network coverage was adequate. Good stuff.However the 4G and 5G infrastructure is seriously lacking in areas with high traffic, for example - Cardiff city centre - it takes me one minute to load a web page (5G, full signal). Cardiff Albany road, further out of the city centre in a less congested area (5G, full signal) - still the same, cannot even text in WhatsApp.For about a year or two I have been blaming my dated Samsung galaxy S10 plus (I was on 4G). However I just got a brand new Samsung galaxy s23 plus and I have already replaced my SIM card (just in case) and I am still facing the same problems... Getting stuck in the middle of town trying to get a taxi home, with full 5G signal and no internet was the straw that broke the camels back.What good is a high internet allowance with rollower if I can't even use it when it is most needed?It's time to switch, reluctantly...",1
I find that coming over from EE to ID has proven to be a mistake EE COVERAGE  I find is better but I will give it a couple of months then reacess the situation,1
"I’m disappointed on how long it takes the complaints team to answer the phone it’s like they only have a few people working and when it comes to network issues in the area they are very evasive and difficult to deal with when it comes to offering any form of credit without me mentioning it directly or them saying they will call me back the next day, only for nothing to happen for it to have to go to deadlock and then having to wait another 10 to 14 days for it to be decided despite their being evidence of an issue that’s clearly not going to be resolved in a timely manor the Complaints procedure needs to be modernised so each individual Complaints handlers has the Access and authority so the Complaint does not go from person to person and complaint to deadlock despite the resolution originally being agreed but not actioned on account",1
"I was recently told by BT that they offer a similar package for just under £8 per month - that is, almost £5 less a month than I pay ID Mobile.I wonder if I should be renewing my contract.",1
"Whilst the actual contract is fantastic value for money, unfortunately reception in my area - Woodley Reading - rarely jumps above 2 bars. Occasionally on my local travels, call drop off happens - (Samsung S21Ultra)",1
I am a 89 year old pensioner trying to take to a real person to dicuss my monthly bill. I have phoned on many occasions but unfortunately get referred to a computer. I don't have one and I have had no help. Please consider the older people.,1
"Signal not so great. Even though the coverage checker showed great coverage indoor and out, I'm lucky to get 2 bars but it's usually 1 or none with calls breaking up. Wifi calling is hit and miss also.",1
"I find the indoor reception is a bit hit and miss where I live and work and the coverage can be a bit sketchy at times. The flip side is when there is a good 5g connection, I have seen speeds up to 700Mbps.",1
The app constantly plays up. Can’t download bills again.Otherwise I’m really happy with the service.Gone on the desktop site and all I get is a blank screen!,1
The price is amazing and the fact that it is a one month rolling contract means I know I can cancel at anytime should I wish.I do find though that the coverage is not always as good on other networks.,1
I was on a Cruise from the 17th December 2023 to 29thDecember 2023...I was unable to use my phone 🤳.... but I have just been told that my next bill will be £97 ...... For What,1
"Using PayG system is very flakey.Every few days the network simply stops working. Can't text or call because I'm ""out of credit"" and the app won't let me login due to a technical error.Once it's working again, I can see that I am definitely not out of credit.Other than that, it's a good experience.Please fix",1
I dislike that I was mis sold a phone last year that I have never used and was not allowed to return. I can't wait for my contract to end somi can go elsewhere and get decent customer service.,1
"This review relates to the refer a friend scheme only, overall with the rest of the ID mobile,  I've had no problems.The refer a friend scheme seems designed to make sure you don't get the referral monies, unless you have the time and persistence. It starts well that you get a link to use to instigate the referral. Other companies then use this link to track and pay the bonus, but not ID mobile.The first step is the referred person needs to make contact to enter the  account number within 14 days. (Hurdle 1)Then you need to remember 90 days later that you referred someone as the money is not credited automatically. If you manage to remember then after a live chat your be told that the other person, either the referrer or referee needs to make contact first as well.  (Hurdle 2).The other person then makes contact and that seems to unlock some blocker on the referee account. (Hurdle 3).Then the referee has to make contact again to again request the bonus is paid (Hurdle 4).You are then told that for the other person to get their bonus they have to make contact again. (Hurdle 5).If you have read this review to this point - you are probably someone who might get the bonus, you have persistence!I queried the process and was sent terms and conditions of the scheme, it may say that you have to take all these steps (it just feels like they are there to thwart issuing the bonus), but in summary won't be referring anyone else - the process is just unnecessarily too time consuming and complicated.",1
"My phone is always cutting off, and my WYFY is rubbish.I could not find a number to ring only a live chat, which I phoned. That day my phone was cutting off every phone call.",1
"The transfer process was traumatic. I was never sure whether I had retained my mobile number.  I was not sure of where I was in the transfer process. Given a choice of transfer date, I chose the earliest date given. Perhaps obvious, my existing supplier stopped my mobile service at 5 pm on that day. But my new SIM card from ID had not arrived by that day. So I had no mobile connection. I contacted iD by chat, and was advised to go to Currys and they would provide a new SIM card and activate it. They installed it but said Currys is not enabled to activate it. I had to find the a way forward on getting home - not aware if where I was in the transfer process. But they were helpful and knowledgeable thankfully, and sorted it. The original new SIM card arrived a day later by post - two days after the transfer date.May I suggest:A road map of progress and actions required.Fewer unco-ordinated and confusing emails in the transfer process.Early reassurance that the original mobile number has definitely been retained.Longer allowance for SIM card delivery by post in regard to the transfer date.Less direction to the chat line and easier access to the helpline people.But there have been no problems with the service since.",1
"I have been with ID for a couple of years and the reception is good so I ordered an upgrade. This never turned up. DPD delivered the phone to the incorrect address and 4 weeks later I still don't have a phone because ID customer services are difficult to get hold of and non-productive. Once you do get through, just passing the blade to DPD I find a customer service process very poor.",1
"Don't know if this is an iD Mobile issue, but every so often (sometimes very often) 4G stops working and the only way to get it back is to restart my phone. Generally good coverage for where I go.",1
All was well until last night when I could not get the app to load up.On checking my bill it looks like both mine and my husbands have a computer malfunction just symbols all over the pages making the bill unreadable.Such a shame as I was very happy until this.,1
"Very reasonable pricing but not great coverage.I frequently seem to be unable to connect to a mobile signal, which is a nuisance. On the other hand, I really appreciate that at the moment at least it is possible to use my phone in Europe without extra changes.",1
"What I would like to see: Helpful people, cheerful people good thoughts from authorities for older people and then action. Politicians to be thinking of how to aid society and then do it, and not just about their income. Lowering of prices and expenses for older people.",1

"Nice to receive an email telling me my bill is available online. Would be even better if the link worked...do these coders EVER check their work? This follows on from iOS not being able to read their pdf files. OK - that was an Apple issue but, with the number of iPhones in circulation, I'd have liked to have been advised of the problem by iD Mobile proactively...",1
"When ever I am abroad, I can't send a photograph by messenger or by my e mails. It was ok on WhatsApp App but my son doesn't have that, so was unable to be in touch as much as I would have liked. Hard getting through on the fone to, so had to keep using my husbands fone. Very disappointed.",1
"Signal on both phone and Internet not great in my area, I have to rely on WiFi calling. We do live in a dip which doesn't help, however I am moving soon to a much better signal area 😊",1
Whilst I appreciate the tariff I pay is low I find it frustrating that very often I can't get a signal on my phone. I have missed many important calls and messages because of this.,1
I like the amount of texts and phone call times allowed.  I dont like the fact that i cant talk to someone in person for assistance.  I dont like doing everything online.  I dont understand how to talk to someone about whether i can pay a one off extra package while on holiday in south africa so that i am able to use my sim only account when away.,1
Unfortunately your network is not as good as it was before. Found that I'm not getting good reception from my home which never was an issue at the beginning.,1
"Certain phone numbers are not supported (which I didn't realise) and I got cut off whilst talking to my insurance company.Several texts say 'undelivered' but are actually delivered, so I'm never sure.It's very cheap.",1
Why 3 stars? Great value for money but... awful speed. Shows 4G/5G... 3-4 Mbps.Rollover data is meaningless as you just can't use the data because of low speed.,1
"The low cost of ID's SIM-only deals is great, as well as not being locked into a contract. These reasons would lead me to give ID 5 stars, but I've only given 3 stars because if you have a problem, you can never speak to a real person and for that reason I be would only give their customer 1 star.",1
"They do not keep bugging you with promotions, they are reasonably priced for the services they provide, but could do better with roaming charges and explanations. Overall a reasonable company to deal with.",1
"Purely online customer service is not ideal. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Thank you for your response to this review, giving me additional ways of contacting you, albeit online.",1
Good phone and network service. Very dissatisfied with customer service when device fault found at contract renewal. This will prompt me to look at alternative providers at next renewal.,1
We constantly have connection issues at home with poor signal quality and calls dropping in and out. We are equi distant from 2 masts and I think the issue is that we keep flipping between masts on where we are in the house,1
"The upside is brilliant priced packages which are very competitive. However, the downside is bad customer care, basically stemming from the fact that it is almost impossible to get through to you when you have an issue, having to queue endlessly on a chat box. If you can resolve that I would definitely give you 5 stars!",1
Loyalty is a thing of the past we get nothing for staying with the same company.Mobile from Curry's as you will know but the price advertised was only for new customers but not advertised as so. Had to get the lesser Mobile I went in for because of monthly payments.So this is surely under the trade description act. Other then that quite content.,1
"Instead of bombarding your customers with emails, you might like to invest in human customer service. A phone number that is quickly answered by a human.",1
I found it so difficult to change my plan & got so stressed you do not take into account the old & vunerable. I did evenually get to speak to someone. I would suggest that you arrange a better system,1
My signal has never been more than 2.5barsThis was much lower than when I checked what this would be prior to switching to id mobile from EE. I have tried to raise a complaint but this requires so many passwords and PIN numbers either by phone or onlineYou need to look into this for me,1
Have tried without success since November to change to sim only for 12 pound per month. Have received order number 130679568. But still no response. My wife is now on the plan I requested. Iam still being charged 37. 87. Which is not Good Enough.Please Sort this out ASAP.,1
"iD misspelt my name. I contacted iD chatline and asked the iD rep to change the first letter of my first name from a W to Y.  My first name begins with a Y.  I spent over 3hrs on the chatline - the iD rep requested a copy of my passport, bills with my name on it etc. Which I could not give because I was not at home.   iD had already taken a direct debit payment from my bank account which of course had my correct name.  After 3 hrs the iD rep said she/he had corrected my name but in fact she/he lied as it has not been corrected.",1
ID Mobile provides a great value package but this comes at a price... for any issues getting hold of a person via chat or phone is nearly impossible. Your only option for a result is using the group conversations and someone providing an answer.,1
When I want a query there is no one on ID side. You get some one to answer on the PC or the phone screen.I need to speak to some one in person.Very disappointed.,1
"I can't remember a recent experience??Good:However, im very happy with my and my daughters plan.Bad:Wish it was easier to talk or communicate with somebody.",1
Good contract deals available.New phone arrived promptly. No instructions at all on how to transfer data from old Samsung mobile to new. No chance of speaking to a live person about anything. They just leave you to it!,1
"There is no easy way to contact ID Mobile so I shall continue to share my experiences with this, wider audience. Having been invited to download a pdf version of my monthly bill I received 4 pages of complete gibberish....It might be easy to solve if only I could speak to a human being...",1
Changed from Three because cheaper and discovered network coverage not as good. V disappointing as I travel constantly in the Uk but you get what you pay for.,1
"I wasn't happy with my new contract,,I was promised unlimited tex ,calls but most of all unlimited data, the person I was dealing with said I would get it ,,cause at the time contract said just 10gigs data ,he said he could change it ,,I have now uped payments £23 a month to get the unlimited data .its a lot for me  ,I'm  74 no Internet in my flat",1
I’m going off the id mobile because the network is very bad I don’t get reception from my mobile phone in any big building I am looking for new network,1
"SIM seems to work fine, stuck in endless customer feedback loop attempting to set up app or account, which sucks massively...Lack of customer service is an issue.",1
"Can't fault the phone for service, no problems experianced but to be charged more per month than is available for a recent model is unacceptable and i will not be renewing my contract in May 2024",1

The Problem with your Company there’s not a Customer Service number I can phone up and speak directly to resolve any problems not chat lines or Iartificial intelligence.,1
The only problem I have is contacting someone.  I want to have a SIM only and not change my phone. It seemed my best option was to go to Curry's but there was such a queue of unhappy people I could not wait.,1
Ultimately a real person had to intervene to get the update I wanted to install correctly. On your auto system I ended up installing same deal twice. The help person who installed update about 10days ago didn't fully install as screens didn't appear on my phone to complete. So I thought it was fixed but it wasn't. I sent 3 emails asking for clarification of what was meant to be happening without response.,1
"loyalty penalised !transferred my wife's account from id mobile to O2 recently. while I'm happy with I'd mobile, I could not get an upgrade phone for the same price as a new customer. the phone I was going to get from id mobile was only available to new customers and was quite a bit more expensive for existing customers .... so my wife became a new customer to O2 and cancelled Id mobile contract.would have been happy to stay with I'd mobile had the upgrade deal been the same as new customer deal.when my own contract is up I will probably also change supplier, should Id mobile still be penalising existing customers!",1
I had issues when upgrading my new mobile.You tried to charge me for the new phone and the old one.It took 5 phone calls to sort it out and was only sorted after I went through the complaints procedure. I was told numerous times someone would phone me back but they never did,1
Actual signal strength is well below that was suggested on checks done before I chose ID network. Low or NO signal at many locations I am at regularly.,1
Our SIM only deal is great for price but it is hit and miss for phone and internet coverage in our area near Dumbarton.Works great in the cities but on the outskirts too many times unable to access the internet or even make a phone call.,1
It has a great easy to use app with all the features like WiFi calling VoLTE etc. Unfortunately it has no 5g signal in Northern Ireland  and I'm having low to zero signal in a lot of areas I frequent . I have my pac code,1
"My husband and I both switched to ID mobile and whilst signal service abroad is great and included in our packages, the signal coverage for both of us in North Staffordshire is very poor. Particularly Trentham area and from Junction 15 to 19 on the M6, especially around Junction 16",1
"I bought a new phone with a 24 month contract on iD Mobile on Black Friday. The SIM card doesn't work and when I try to register for an iD Mobile account online it says I have the incorrect details.  I spent several hours on the live chat trying to rectify the problem only to be told that my information does not match the details associated with the new number provided iD Mobile as part of the contract. Now iD refuse to help because they say I am not the account holder. Instead they told me to go back to Carphone Warehouse where I purchased the offer.My details on the Carphone Warehouse systems are correct but they claim they cannot do anything to help despite both iD Mobile and Carphone Warehouse being owned by Currys.After calling the complaints team at iD Mobile I was again told I wasn't the account holder and to email my account details and a copy of my ID to them.  I did this immediately and it took over 48 hours for them to reply that the details I gave them are incorrect or incomplete.  They asked for my iD Mobile customer PIN which I do not know because I cannot register for an online account and the name of my bank. I am still waiting for a response.I am concerned about my personal data and have reservations about using a company that can make such a big mistake without offering adequate customer service.  I'm now stuck paying for a SIM  card I cannot use on a contract that I cannot cancel! I  am also worried about how iD Mobile is handling my  personal data as this appears to be a pretty big breach.At this point I wouldn't recommend iD Mobile to anybody, from my experience the lower prices donot make up for the hassle and the stress.Update (15/12/2023): This issue has now finally been resolved by the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile. It has been a stressful couple of weeks and I feel that no customer should have to deal with the problems I have encountered, especially when the original issue was caused through no fault of my own.  I feel there is a lesson to be learned here for the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that communication between the two companies needs to be improved.Having said that, I would hope that the issue that I encountered was out of the ordinary and eventually I did manage to contact representatives from the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that were able to help me and provided a level of customer service that I would expect from a big company.  It's just a shame that this didn't happen in the first place.",1
"I feel that I got a very fair and good deal from iD mobile and I would have given 5 stars, but I've been waiting months for my promised £30 voucher, which was part of the deal, when I took out the contract. Having messaged the customer services twice, from the follow up emails, which I receive from them, I still haven't had a reply, or my £30 voucher. Their customer services is something which needs to be improved, even when trying to set up your phone as a new customer. If a company offers something as part of a special deal, they should honour it. There is nobody to talk to. Other than those problems, it all seems to work ok.",1
Currys assistants were very helpful and I think the deal I got on the Pixel 7 Pro was very good.My critism is the fact that the phone signal when at home is very poor. Usually no more than 1 bar and often no signal at all.,1
"The help chat is very painful to use. The prices are good and the coverage is great thoThank you for the reply, interesting that you assume I have had trouble connecting someone on live chat, that's not the case. I was able to contact someone, but they were not able to resolve my issue, only able to half answer my problem",1
"Signal not greatI struggle to get more than a single bar of 5G reception fairly frequently even though before signing up with ID, I checked coverage and it was supposed to be fine. If I had known then what I knew now, I may not have signed with ID.",1
"Good service and signal in most areas. Had quite a delay retrieving my original phone number, approximately 2 weeks and began to worry if I'd made the right decision. This finally got sorted and all is well now",1
"I cancelled my sim only contract to start another contract with a new phone.Unfortunately the sim only contract was never cancelled & I have been paying both for the last 3 months.I've had quite an ordeal to get my money back. It was an upsetting time as I am a pensioner & truly cannot afford to lose this money, through no fault of my own. They agreed finally to end the sim only contract & refund the money. But only after a long upsetting struggle. One that I didn't need at the moment",1
"Having written a 5* review 2 days ago, today the ID mobile network has been  unavailable, with no notification or information available unless I go hunting for it. At first I thought my phone was faulty and spent time trying to reset it!This is the first negative experience I've had with them. I accept that networks will at times experience technical problems, but this has been a full day now, and ID mobile should have attempted to notify customers - at the very least they could have emailed us. Even on their website updated information is sadly lacking.",1
"I recently needed to download a file,it took ages,the connection constantly dropped out and then reconnecting. I had 5 bars of signal strength and a 4g connection.",1
"Ordered an iPhone 13 24 month contract specifically because of the 3 month Apple Tv subscription they offer, yet nothing has been mentioned to me about this after my order was delivered. Live chat team member was unhelpful and didn't know anything about it. Very poor service from ID Mobile. Where is is my offer?",1
"So far, I am pleased with the internet connection.I am having a lot of problems with the messages that I try to send. Sometimes it says 'message failure' or 'not delivered'",1
"Good network for a low cost - if you need any customer service though go elsewhere!  No one will get back to you (it’s all auto response, no humans), there is no phone number and the ‘live-chat’ wanted to put me in a queue for an hour. Unfortunately will likely have to move elsewhere as there is no way to talk to anyone without going into store! Bit disappointed.",1
"ID mobile offer a great price and to be honest I haven’t used it yet.A cautious warning to those watching/ trying to build their credit score - they carry out a hard search and this dropped my score by nearly 100 points on clear score - not sure I would have bothered if I had known a 12 month pay monthly, £12, sim had this impact!!",1
"The Motorola Edge 40 has some glitches, it won't default to wifi calling sometimes.Outlook freezes on the calendar (never happened with my Samsung)Forgets email passwords and I need to reload the account to get it functioning.",1
"Please note the service is good, however the billing and PDF bills have switched to a foreign language in the app and cannot be changed. The app is a bit slow slow and clunky. However the network, service and support are good well worth it.",1
"Not long with iD and no issues in UK, so great value for money. Spent a couple of days in the Netherlands where almost all connections (using an iPhone SE) were very slow, hardly useable, and a small number lightening fast. Didn't seem matter which supplier. somewhat disappointing.",1
"Good package prices, easy to set up. Not helpful that customer service not available to contact.Signal is very poor too non existent in my area so often unable to use the phone which is a big issue and will be a real consideration come renewal.",1
"New to ID mobile after 4 business day of waiting for the sim card to arrive was offered £10.00 compensation which i accepted and then the chat person kept pushing saying the royal mail don't delivery on Saturdays and that l could travel to get a sim card from my local Currys which is 7 miles away. She would not confirm if l was indeed l was being charged for something l don't have yet, and then withdrew the offer of ten pounds as l requested to speak to her Manager and has now passed to the complaints team so l have to wait for a call back in the next three days. Totally dismissing my requests clearly totally disengaged from what she was supposed to be doing not reading my messages correctly  below is a snippet of our conversation :_ID Mobile 1st you say you accept the offer then you say you want the complaints team to contact you on ********* to speak to a real person.Me: I'm sorry who do you think you are talking tooMe: Maybe you should go back and read the conversation as you are clearly not ?Me: I accepted your offer and then you kept pushing and now we are here ?ID Mobile : To you since I'm not real enough for you I will be passing your complaint to our complaints team.Great customer service",1
"Your ordering process is very poor - it does not explain that you can only order one sim card at a time.  You get an order confirmation and then a day or so later, get an email advising that you have been declined due to credit referencing.There is no contact number which allows you to speak to a human - it is all done through webchat which is very slowThe package is great, delivery (when the order actually goes through) is great, the set up/number porting is fine.I would also like to be able to have one account with several numbers and control them all through one account.",1
The mobile data can be very slow at times.   The call quality is not as good as my old provider. Easy to understand app   Have used their customer service and it was good even though only online.  They do have calling customer service if you have special needs.,1
"The prices are great, especially compared with EE. However, iD Mobile uses Three's network and this seems very patchy and in certain places is unusable where other networks are ok.The most annoying feature though is the fact that you can only manage one SIM in the app. This makes no sense at all and just causes me problems. To check my spend etc on my family's 3 SIMs I have to log in to 3 separate accounts! This is a pointless irritation that could easily be fixed.Another plus is that even on my old-ish phone, Wifi Calling works! That's an excellent feature.",1
"Great price, patchy coverage (maybe it's where I live).. when out and about I'm often without a signal for an hour or so.I'm told ID piggybacks on Three.. wonder if their users report the same?",1
"Very poor signal coverage it seems most places I go especially anything outside of a major town. Whilst ID signal is 1 bar Vodafone on my work phone is 3 bars . It’s really frustrating even with 2 bars nothing loads up or takes forever whilst my work stuff is fine. Poor but cheap, take your pick.",1
"iD offer very affordable pay monthly contracts, £26 for an iPhone 13 with unlimited data. The service is ok, I travel around the UK and the signal isn’t great in Leeds centre (data doesn’t work at all) or York along with other cities. Vodafone which was my last phone network was £15 more but suppose you get a much better signal and service if you pay that little bit more. The signal or data isn’t great with iD but if you need an affordable option then iD will do the job but it can also be frustrating when 30% of the time your calls might drop or you can’t use the internet.",1
"The deal given by ID mobile (June 2023) - Iphone 14 pro and good data was the best i found in the market. However, the connectivity and its network across the UK (where there is no 5G) was average to poor. Its a new network so i guess it may improve in the next few years but for now its slow in many parts of the country.",1
                                           Been with 02 since 2012.Signal was great same with 5g roll out  very rarely have zero signal. Data tracking is very easy on the o2 app. Overall as a company not bad unless you need to speak to customer service. Long time loyalty not rewarded. A friend who's been with 3 5 years gets deals for loyalty a friend on Vodafone gets great loyalty deals for renewing too.  O2 have pushed prices up and up and with annual contract price rises over their new 4 year contracts the showed for black Friday deals was far more than the 36 month currently Overall factoring total price of phone etc. It's almost like o2 currently are actively trying to get customers to leave. Prices are more than other providers and longer. 12 months to go then will be free of 02. The customer service team in the last 18 months have been appalling at best. Contacted them to pay off a contract when was made redundant and got told I don't owe anything again affirmed why and what I wanted to do to be told same again. Was unsuccessful. Sure that's borderline illegal to refuse to allow someone to pay off a contract in full when they have been made redundant and want to pay full balance.,1
"The O2 hosted Ginuwine and Tyrese yesterday, and they were absolutely incredible. They truly owned the stage with their energy and fresh presence. Their performances were polished, and their voices sounded just as amazing as they did in the ’90s—professional, nostalgic, and unforgettable.SWV also delivered a great set, and their talent shone through. That said, a small note to the O2: £15 for chicken and chips was a bit steep for the portion size!Tyrese is still as handsome as ever, and Ginuwine remains the epitome of charm and sexiness. Thank you for such an amazing performance. Honestly, they should’ve headlined the show—it was packed, and the crowd clearly loved them.However, it’s clear that so many people came to see Jodeci. If Ginuwine and Tyrese had performed alongside Jodeci, it would’ve been an unforgettable comeback event. Jodeci, please bring your talent back to England—we’re all waiting for you! KC and JoJo, we’re ready to celebrate, drinks in hand, before the show. Make it happen!",1
"Overall good service getting my new phone, network etc. Though the netwrok and connection is much better than Three so I'm not mad.I did nearly get scammed and hacked with a couple of weeks of moving to them, so very scary.And the case that I bought with it (iPhone 16 Pro Iceland Ultra D3O MagSafe Kick Phone Case) which has a ring/stand that just fell off in my hands after having it for about a month and a bit scared me. When I tried to complain about it I was told it wasn't covered and there wan't anything they could do. Don't buy that phone case and good luck!",1
"I recently had an issue with a new phone I had ordered. I don’t believe it was o2 responsible delivery issues, more so DPD. That being said the customer care wasn’t the best. It was hard to communicate the issue and I had to rehash it every time I called.That was until I spoke to an advisor call Kamarl. He was fantastic I would give him  5*, he spoke sense, followed up and was incredibly helpful. Unfortunately not all the call handlers were as helpful as him.",1
You need to sort out your inflation.I'm having to leave and rejoin just so I can get a better deal.Other networks fix their rate no increases.After 3 years you eventually end up paying 20% more than market rates for being a loyal customer.,1
I was wished a wishmas magic by text. Are you a bunch of witches druids and warlocks now 02?  Sort it out it's Christ's mass Jesus Christ.  Happy Christmas on the birth of Jesus our saviour. 🙏🏼,1
"Advisors at 02 are very helpful, its only their tools with servicing calls and taking payments which let them down here.With text message, a receipt to confirm or summarize  the event which has happened through service may aid the customer with better experience.Also IVR needs to give customer time to select an option. Its a constant shambles for company that has good care with their customers.In waiting room, advise, caller what their position is and to offer a call-back.Also use emails to summarize call handling.GDPR Regulations followed with everyone.",1
"Ordering online is a nightmare from start to finish doing a Switch Up online.  Set the contact number on my order to the wrong number, and set the order up wrong with DPD, no one can help me get the PIN I need for delivery.  Not sure what I'm meant to do as I only get 14 days to return my old phone. No one will help on live chat or Phone keep blaming DPD when it is a known problem documented regularly on the 02 forum.However buying different item from in store the experience was totally different they couldn’t have been anymore helpful and kind.Don’t buy online go to a shop.",1
New customer here.So I ordered online the phone and airtime I wanted.Samsung s24 meh it'll do.Told delivery in 5 days. 5 days later still without a phone and no update.I ended up having a 1 hour phone call to see if I can get a different phone nope.I cancelled my entire order instead. No email stating out of stock. Could of saved me a lot of time.Operators tried to charge me £20 despite having £7 a month airtime on the previous order.Nope not happy.Giving 3 stars as the last person I spoke too was really nice.,1
I usually don't have any problems but I was a little concerned when I realised I couldn't activate my call waiting. I called O2 and they said prepaid customers don't get call waiting. Since when?! I'm pretty disappointed about this as call waiting shouldn't be an upgraded service and available to all. I will be looking to a new provider. There are some good deal out there at the moment,1
"over 2 weeks for customer service to get back to me .want an upgrade to a new phone , and want to stay with 02 , but 02 want £54 pound , another company can give me the phone i want with an 02 contract for £43 plus a £150 cash back .02 will not match , they are the same company .So thank you o2 for wanting to overcharge existing customers .i do have to say Laura at 02 customer service , wow great service , thank you , so now 3 stars instead of one , but if they helped in the first place we wouldnt of had to write a review",1
"I am, as I start to write, hanging on to the 02 customer service, having spent hours going around in circles through the menus on their website trying to cancel a Disney+ add-on that I've never been able to access and am now being charged for.However, eventually Rohit restored my faith by sorting the cancellation and giving me a better phone deal.I give 1 star to the frustrating website but 5 stars to Rohit.",1
"I was switched from Virgin Media to 02 some years ago on a monthly plan paid by Direct Debit. My experience has been fine but, today, out of the blue, I took a call from 02. The man apparently wanted to know if I had any complaints. My only complaint was that I did not want such uninvited calls at inconvenient moments. I did not understand why he was calling so I looked at Trustpilot. I am shocked at all the recent complaints. I have had no reason to call 02 but these complaints do make me concerned about the company and the difficulty sorting out an issue were it to arise.",1
"Calling 202 for assistance is pretty awful. Long waiting times that normally result in you just being cut off and having to start again. At one point I had been on the phone to an agent for 10 mins and was actually making progress, just to be hung up on unexpectedly with no call back. I later learned that Carlo the agent had not actioned anything we were discussing.The online chat service is considerably better, wait times are not as long as calling and the agents seem more willing and able to help. Thanks Rupali!",1
"The wait to be answered was over 16 minutes and the whole time I was waiting I was assaulted with hideous music, that actually hurt! Their were very high pitched notes that drilled into my brain, alongside loud static, which caused me to wince.Before the horrendous noise I had to explain myself multiple times to the automated system which kept interrupting me.Once I got through, the operator was helpful and able to help me with half of my problem. The other half will have to wait for my call back tomorrow by a different team. At least there won't be any so called music!",1
"It's been ok.When I was transferred to O2 from my previous mobile phone provider both the O2 website and app were down, this was really annoying.The high number of messages and emails about my billing is annoying, also the app keeps asking me for an additional pin whenever I open it.On the plus side, the network has proved fairly reliable and fast, and the price is good.",1
"My contract with O2 has just come to an end. They have been my provider for many years, even decades. My monthly payment has just increased approximately £2.00 to about £13.00 a month for 4GB of data so I will be moving provider very soon. If I renew my contract with O2 it is a minimum of 24 months for the same deal except you get an extra 2GB a month for approximately £11.00 per month. So an understanding why customers change providers.",1
"Thanks to the O2 customer service team and special thanks to Mr. Shadley who has resolved my device Samsung A 52 S . It was suddenly an unknown cause of a dark screen problem, and he gave the solution with an alternative backup, I had an old iPhone 6 plus. He has connected the O2 services to it. I have been trying to contact last two days, approximately 7 hours of trying, I became very upset with the O2 customer service team, however Once Mr Shadley gave person-centered care cordially and resolved the issues, I appreciated his help. My name is Mohammad Shahjahan My O2 contact is 07941366457. I was really impressed by his help.",1
"I can't say I am completely unhappy about this company, as going to Europe without having to worry about data is a good plus. Network coverage isn't bad too. However:1-Once you sign a 12 or 18 contract with them, be prepared to pay more for what they offer to new customers if you compare the rates2-They constantly increase the rates, more than other companies3-Customer service average chat: after the bot shuts your chat in your face several times ""because we are very busy"", if you manage to talk to someone be prepared for 20 minutes of security questions, agents handling maybe 20 cases at the same time, ignoring the request,  and giving you random answers - totally useless",1
"i responded to their ""amazing unrepeatable once in a lifetime"" offer. It includes a tradin, and u get £100 off on deal, but when you ACTUALLY push the buttons it's £14.40 on the telly, I did it twice before giving up and chatting to the helpful lady in South Ifrica who alleged that it's £100 from 02 added to my account, and £14 from the recycling shower. But they can't actually show that anywhere on their webshite. Nowhere do you get a screen showing the Whole Deal, BEFORE you actually place the order.But all software is same - written by spotty kids in dark rooms, never tested on real people in the real world.",1
To cut this saga short my number was 'transferred' from my previous mobile airtime supplier.only not all of the relevant files were transferred to O2.After my number was 'transferred' I found that I could only ring out to anyone but initially no one could call me.Eventually we established that only a person using an O2 sim could call me but  no one else.No one at O2 was able to help resolve the problem.I have updated this review as I received a call from O2 explaining what had happened.My old number is now working with my new telephone company.,1
"I have been with O2 for over 15 years. Never had a major issue.However, this network unfortunately took a very sentimental thing from me. In Dec 2021 my Grandad died and had left me a voicemail a few days prior. I know I did not delete this. Even though the message was SAVED, I have never been able to retrieve it - it was deleted. They have since changed their VM service to need a confirmation to cancel VMs. I had also noticed various other of my personal VMs deleted around the same time. I know this is subjective to me, but that VM is something I will never be able to get back. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",1
"I have been an O2 customer (through affiliates such as Carphone Warehouse or direct) since June 2004. There were two good things about this network provider, for my personal experiences: Customer Service and Signal Quality. Even though the CS hasn’t waned for me yet, the Signal Quality has been shocking compared to their recent speeds. In 2014, I first got 4G in my area @ 68Mbps. Now it’s 2023 and I’m averaging around 4Mbps if I’m lucky. Naturally, the jargon spewed will be about number of users in the area but that’s nonsense as the city centre has speeds of around 160Mbps for 4G. In a pandemic and post-pandemic era, this is absolutely below par for modern mobile network expectations and delivery. Please sort it out.",1
"Been with O2 for over 15 years, had good and bad, only grip is signal coverage, it’s rubbish drop out quite often and Data going from a rare 5G to 4G that just about works",1
I've been with o2 for many years and never had a single problem.On the other hand I've ordered a phone this morning for same day click and collect and still haven't got a single email that the collection is available.Might seem like a small gripe but you shouldn't have that on the website if the same day collection is not processed by the end of the day.If I didn't mind waiting I would've ordered the next day delivery.,1
"Tried to call O2 to expedite PAC code processing for number transfer to new O2 SIM to unlock Virgin Media + 02 Volt benefits. First few attempts to call 202 just failed or disconnected following a number of rings. Eventually got into a queue with a warning of 45 minute wait. Spent a long time listening to super low bitrate hold music.When I eventually spoke to someone, they confirmed the schedule for number migration + were able to associate my Virgin Media account with my O2 account to secure Volt benefits (double minutes + US roaming).",1
"OK, but not great. Query about changing pin code for sim card resulted in ‘please go to o2 shop’. Quite difficult (language problems) to have a meaningful conversation with o2 agent.",1
Service is normally decent but the overall performance of the network has declined so badly over the years. They do allow 25GB of roaming in EU so that helps. Prices aren’t as competitive as they used to be.,1
I joined o2 in June 2022 on a 12 month contract. In April 2023 the price of my contracted increased 17.25% from £8 to £9.38. A whopping £16.56 per annum.I called customer retentions on Fri 9th Jun and had to wait in a queue for about 14 mins.The analyst took my details but didn't sound enthusiastic about his job. The analyst placed me on hold for to look for a deal. After 12 minutes they hung up.I called back with similar wait times. The analyst initially only offered uncompetitive rates at a higher cost. I said I wanted the rate given to new customers. On directing him to the moneysavingexpert website he agreed to match the 30GB SIM for £8.Now upgraded my review from 1 to 3 stars.,1
After a stressful change with 02 from EEOver 10 calls to customer service and a visit to Wilmslow store Kersty Jones managed to sort out my husbands phone.  In my opinion this girl needs a pay rise or get her to train all your staff.  Thank you Kersty for helping us ♥️,1
I am waiting on them to fix something. Not too bad in general where I live but they are telling me a mast broken meaning I do not receive/ cannot make calls is not their problem. This may well become a 1 star review if they do not pull their socks up,1
"Wish I had read the reviews before starting a contract. Was very happy with GiffGaff for 10 years but they don’t offer Apple Watch mobile service so I switched. A disaster from the start, they set me up with two separate numbers for some reason and two months later still am unable to activate my watch after more than a dozen calls. The customer support is disheartening — they know next to nothing about the issue, tried to get me off the phone by saying they will call back and if they do, they hang up right away. Worst company I have ever encountered.EDIT: After several more attempts I was eventually contacted by Robert who gave a solution — I needed to update my phone number in iPhone settings (it won’t happen automatically with a SIM only plan) and do a SIM swap to try again. It worked. He also offered to follow up. The issue is a lack of knowledge across call centres but I eventually did get the help I needed and am updating my score to reflect that.",1
"Mixed experience where one customer advisor was either inexperienced or trying to dishonourable keep me in contract despite explaining as on refresh wanted to cancel the monthly rolling contract for one of my numbers with phoned returned in period. He said I can.choose to believe him or not but I knew he was wrong so ended call and rang back to get a really helpful adviser who came across as helpful, knowledgeable and listening to what I was wanting. I put it down to questionable training and development if two advisors could be poles apart. Just wish at end of call it asked you to rate your experience on keypad as one would get 0 out of 5 and the next 5 out of 5.",1
"Spoke to a wonderful women Laneez. She was extremely poilet, going above and beyond to help with my issue!! I’ve had an ongoing data issue which is why I’m rating low, however my experience with Laneez was great, she was very helpful and reassuring. Completely taking ownership of the problem.",1
Good deal when moving to O2 from Vodafone but signal cuts out quiet abit & very often sounds like we’re talking under water.I’ll see how it goes for the remainder of the contract,1
Disappointing data speeds (4G or 5G) and sometimes really poor signals when compared to my VF or EE numbers. I'm only keeping this contract as O2's roaming offer outside EU is better than the others and the offers in Priority app are usually decent.,1
"Good intentions and really friendly staff, but it just takes an absolute age to do anything.2 x 40 minute phone calls to change a small detail regarding my direct debit.Should be faster",1
Hannah from payments team was super helpful and went through a lot of solutions for my issue with me. 5 stars for Hannah but 1 star for o2 the money hungry company that actively makes it difficult to open complaints on purpose,1
"I have been moved over from Virgin to O2 on a sim only contract. Great coverage and a good price too but I am fed up of the constant messages from O2 about my usage, bills due to be paid, bills paid, DD requested etc. I get more messages from them than my best friend.",1
"I have mine and my husband's contacts on O2 with them getting £85 a month from us. I've always paid early and sometimes overpaid.I'm trying to cancel my husband's contract that has ended. He has a new phone and new network as there is no incentive to stay with O2 - less perks, most perks located in London, and it was more expensive to upgrade with O2 after being a loyal customer for many years than get a new contact elsewhere.I can't request a PAC code through SMS, I can't request one through My O2 account and I can't cancel the contract through My O2 either. I was waiting to talk to a chat agent for over 30 mins to then having to wait another 15 mins after my first message to then be sent to wait for another chat agent for no apparent reason. They told me to go through My O2 account then disconnected. I've heard about all the people being on hold for hours after calling 202, so I have no clue how I'm supposed to cancel our contracts!Edit - I can say there is at least one decent person at O2. My last resort was to send a message through Facebook and I was finally able to get my issue sorted. All the stars just for them!",1
"Appeared to have been overcharged, a lost mobile being replaced in an O2 shop and probably incorrectly set up by staff in the shop, to access an unneeded ""wifi"" signal ?.  O2 proved difficult to contact, both online & by mobile, but on contact, the operator was very helpful, arranging a probable refund and polite throughout.  Line was exceptionally poor, I presume due to the location I'd had to take the phone call in.  Apologies to operator for any annoyance on my part",1
"I have had good service and been a long time with O2 for years, even the few years I was with Giff gaff (also O2 network). I like the priority offers although I don't use them as much as I used to. Since they have had a mast down near Chester, the coverage has become atrocious. I'm not able to have proper voice calls in my flat. I have had to resort to my landline which thankfully I still have but costs me to use.",1
"O2 is just okay-ish. I have been with them, SIM Only customer, for 2 years but I decided to port away to another network after getting tired of not being able to properly use mobile data when I'm out and about.It's okay for general web-browsing but anything more data-heavy in most locations and it will struggle a lot compared to the other networks. 5G on O2 is often slower than 4G, or even 3G, elsewhere.Coverage is its strength and is on par with the leader EE and in some places will beat it. The service options available, like VoLTE, VoWifi, eSim, etc. are quite similar to the competition but the implementation can sometimes seem a bit shaky.O2 Priority is probably the best reward system alongside Vodafone Very Me but it's hardly a thing I can't live without.Offers good value for money, if comparison or cashback sites are used, and it's the only main network that has EU roaming included on all plans and with a generous 25GB limit. The Volt benefits, double data and free roaming in extra locations is a nice extra.My experience with Customer Service has been sporadic but has been between okay and good, apart from one time when I couldn't correctly contact them for a whole weekend about a billing issue.If you are looking for a network for calls, texts and basic data it can be a good choice. If you need something more on the data-side then look elsewhere.",1
"I had a highly disappointing experience with O2 as my network provider. They consistently overcharged me, billing me more than my selected tariff, even after I canceled my O2 account and informed them about it. Their customer service was abysmal, with excruciatingly long wait times on the phone. Overall, I found their billing system and customer service to be a nightmare. My experience with O2 left me thoroughly frustrated and disappointed.",1
After trying for 2 days I eventually got a real person to talk to and managed to sort my contract. Absolutely impossible to do on the app as kept saying my password was incorrect which it wasn't.,1
"I bought a Samsung Z Fold 5 on 7 Aug 2023 through O2 and they had an offer to buy ear buds worth £219 for £1. I have contacted 02 customer service to claim this offer and was told I should receive a code after 30days from date of purchase. I was told to contact them after 5th September if code had not been  received. I called on 6th September and was told a form had been completed and was to expect the code within 48hours.I still didn't get the code and after a few days I called again. This time I was referred to Samsung but Samsung advised that this was an O2 offer and the code was meant to come from O2. I called 02 again and was promised that the code would be send.Today it's 10th October, I still haven't heard from O2.",1
"No problem with service, however at end of my contract when I'd paid for my phone they thought they could still charge me for it. They are now my ex provider",1
The stars are for Ashley at O2 in Solihull who finally sorted our problem below!He was very professional while other colleagues in the shop kept being exasperated while saying customer services are rubbish and then saying we have a new system no one knows how to use and left it at that.Customer services on the phone were absolutely awful - has taken so many months to activate the virgin media O2 deal because our data was inputted incorrectly and created duplicate accounts! Customer service either had no clue virgin media was pairing with O2 or kept transferring you to people all equally as unhelpful.Ashley finally sorted it for us!,1
"Credit where credit is due 02 are actually doing something about the issues with the handset and all is getting sorted thanks you 02And yet another 5 hours and 20 minutes over two days of time to 02 customer service with no help. My problem is I have missed my bill this month but 02 cannot do anything about it ok it's my fault for missing the payment all I asked for was a extension of time in which I got refused.........I have been suffering with 02 no service for just over 6 months due to masts being down as they informed me there is nothing that they can do because it's in my small print in a contract I signed.It basically started that if 02 are down it's my problem because they don't actually have to provide a service lol but I pay for a service, that I'm not actually receiving. I asked for a extension of time (as I have bared with them) to make the payment but no they are unable to help.Anyone who is reading this please do research and go with a better network provider if you fall in the same category as me they won't help you with a service or help with payment.",1
"I have had the same mobile number since 1994, I have been an O2 customer since it was BT Cellnet (Yes, I am that old). They really need to do better at customer relations, they are abysmal, and now, 5G, what a joke that is, I have had to restrict my phone to 4G to ensure a signal, on 5G is is like using dial up modems again. I was once an engineer working on the O2 cell towers, they used to have a decent power output - they don't now, of all the cell providers in the UK, their towers have the lowest output of the lot - and that is purely to save money on electricity costs, certianly not provide an adequate service for customers - and I use the adjective Adequate advisadly...I cannot, in all conscience recommend them, and when my contract is up I will finally transfer to a new provider - I haven't until now through laziness on my part, but enough is enough.",1
"My phone was stolen on Monday and O2 immediately blocked my number which was amazing. Thank you O2 for working so quickly.I went into store to get a new sim but since I’m on my Dad’s plan for multi sim discount, I wasn’t allowed to do ANYTHING, despite my name being attached to my number and since my dad is in a different city, I travelled there to go into a store to get my sim. Unfortunately they didn’t check whether my number had been blocked in store and it turns out my number had been double barred (whatever that means) which meant I will not have had a connection to the O2 network for nearly 48 hours instead of the usual 24 hours. The customer service assistant did apologise for this, which I appreciate but it would have been so much easier if O2 would allow authorised contacts instead of only talking to the account holder because I would have been able to solve it much, much earlier and also get my sim earlier.Please O2, allow authorised contacts so that this doesn’t inconvenience people in the future.",1
"O2 the guys in your shops are fantastic but sadly I can’t get onto the shop when I’m working so sadly have to call customer services. Please please please O2 start employing some English speaking staff, the last three times I have had to call you guys I have had to repeat myself over and over again it’s sooooo frustrating and must be hard for the call centre guys too, I also don’t have time to spend half an hour on the phone for something that should be done in 5 minutes without the language barrier… honestly really thinking of getting rid of O2",1
"O2 can either be very good or very poor. For example they sent me a phone case I didn't order and charged me for it.It really depends on the advisor, some are very knowledgeable and helpful. While some are not.",1
Im not happy with the ssrvice 02 provides i never have any signal it doesnt matter where i am i have never got beyond a joke as my job consists of traveling alot and i live in a city!,1
"I upgraded to the z fold 3 don't get me wrong it came after being delivered to a different address. Quite disappointed that it didn't come with a plug since the charger isn't a USB end, no screen protectors, no headphones when you buy cheaper phones you get the lot so why not the same with the newer phones. It definitely should come with at least a plug for the charger.",1
"I’ve been saddled with O2 by Virgin. Out of the 3 mobile numbers registered on Virgin Family plan 1 number was transferred to O2 and is visible on MyO2 app and the other 2 numbers were transferred to O2 but are parked somewhere on the system. I have no access to them via O2 app and so can’t manage spend, allowances etc. but O2 are still dutifully charging me for them. After about 6 months of on-off chasing O2 unsuccessfully to merge 3 numbers on my account I got fed up and told them to stuff it. The customer service was 50/50, some tried to help but had no idea how, others were incompetent and rude. Then I discovered that Virgin tied me into O2 via their Volt package and if I ditch O2 then my Virgin broadband doubles in price. After another few hours of my life on the phone to Virgin and O2 that I’ll never get back Virgin told me they managed to remove O2 ‘benefit’ from my Volt package and keep my discount and I can now cancel O2. Virgin phoned O2 themselves and then transferred me through to get PAC codes for the 3 numbers I wanted to move out of O2. This time I finally got through to somebody with brains in the UK call center. They explained how to set up alternative account for my other 2 numbers and couldn’t have been more helpful and knowledgeable and managed to persuade me to stay with O2 for another 12 months by taking a third off my bill.  Maybe Virgin have access to better level of O2 customer service because whenever I phoned O2 directly I ended up speaking to somebody in overseas call centers with poor English and wrong attitude.Anyway, my overall rating is 3 stars: I did get what I wanted (access to other 2 numbers and reduced contract cost) but customer service is very poor and transfer from Virgin to O2 was crap.",1
"My overall experience with O2 has been mixed. There is no other way to describe it.Let's start off with the positives.I have what I would call an unbeatable deal from O2 thanks to the Virgin Mobile migration. My phone bill is £6.79/mo for completely unlimited data (on VM, it was for 2GB, plan price was originally 2GB for a 12 month contract in 08/2018), which no other network would ever be able to beat. I currently use around 40GB in a month, which is a stark contrast to never using over 4GB in a month for 5 years. Granted my usage habits have changed now that I'm free to burn my data.Through the Virgin Mobile migration, I also gained the ability to use 4G calling and WiFi calling (yes Virgin did have the ability for both, but it just would have been a pain to set up) from the moment I migrated. Unfortunately, these features did disappear for a long time (from about July to mid-December) which sucks. I don't make calls often but both options make calls crystal clear and reliable.A bit after mid-November, I decided to get a SIM swap with O2, since I was still using my old Virgin SIM (which was originally programmed to connect to the EE network, still have remnants of that even with my new O2 SIM with the T-Mobile MNC seemingly reporting ""Virgin Mobile"" when manually searching for networks). The SIM swap processed extremely quickly with being delivered within just 2 days (one day after my order confirmation), which was a stark contrast from the experience that I had with moving someone from Plusnet to EE (SIM took 4 days to deliver and EE didn't even send confirmation details).Priority is a cool plus to have and getting Volt features is nice too.Now the negatives.With the migration, I was promised the visual voicemail feature on my Android phone, but it has yet to work for me. I've had a tab for it appear once, but that's it.On Virgin, RCS always worked perfectly fine. Meanwhile on O2, I've had a few problems (particularly by the migration from O2's RCS to Jibe RCS) and it's left me unable to use RCS.I'd like to finally end this off with a concern I have for the future as an O2 customer. Due to the way that O2 migrated Virgin customers, my tariff price is £13.29 with a £6.50 discount bolt-on. I am concerned that the annual price increases will cost more on O2 than it would of on Virgin due to the way that the migration was handled.",1
"I don't really have any issues with O2, have been a customer for many years, I do however think they can improve by using another delivery company instead of DHL Parcels UK, I was offered next day delivery by O2 for my upgrade. Still no sign, should of been delivered 31/10/22. Seems I'm not the only one having problems. O2 needs to get a reliable delivery company not fraudsters.",1
"As of the time of writing this review, one of our contracts has been canceled, and we're hoping it stays that way. Prior to this, my family had three contracts: one for myself, one for my dad, and one for my little brother. My dad and I had a generally positive experience with our contracts, with only occasional internet signal issues, which were infrequent and didn't significantly affect our overall satisfaction.Now, let's delve into the canceled contract concerning my little brother. Approximately two months ago, he temporarily lost his phone, but he managed to retrieve it the following day. On the day the phone was lost, we promptly contacted the service provider to report it and have the number barred. We were informed that we'd need to wait for 24 hours for the bar to be lifted, which we accepted. However, for the following three days, my brother couldn't make calls or use data. We reached out to customer support, only to be advised that switching SIM cards would be quicker. We visited the first store in Wembley, but my brother failed to answer the security questions and lacked the required identification, which, understandably, the store couldn't overlook.We then tried another store in Edgware while I was taking care of my car. We brought two forms of ID and proof of billing, and requested a new SIM card. However, we faced the same issue with security questions and ID verification. The system seemed to have a glitch in specifying which security question to answer. We contacted the service provider, and it turned out that my brother had two security questions and answers, and the system wasn't clear on which one to use. Despite answering correctly, the issue persisted.After trying to resolve the problem for several days, including obtaining multiple SIM cards and switching to different phones, we realized the problem wasn't with the SIM but likely linked to my brother's account. The service provider promised to investigate, but after a week, they requested another week to continue their inquiry. Keep in mind that we made repeated calls during this process, and sometimes the support team didn't have the necessary information, forcing us to provide it repeatedly.After waiting for over a month and a half with no resolution in sight, we decided to cancel the contract. Fortunately, we were given credit, so we didn't have to pay, but it became apparent that having a contract was pointless if we couldn't use the SIM. Interestingly, we switched to Giffgaff, which operates on the same network as our previous provider (O2), using the PAC code for our number, and everything worked perfectly. As such, I don't expect a cancellation bill, as I left the contract due to the absence of service, which should be evident in their records. It appears that my account was disabled at the time of writing this review.",1
Transferred over from virgin to o2 definitely an improvement over virgin mobile network has a smoother experience coverage is great at my home very poor at my work but this service is very cheap compared to the competitors seems to be better than my experience with o2 two years ago,1
Good service all round. But I think advisors need to explain certain terms of deals such as O2 Switch Up. The problem is it’s being advertised as upgrade your phone whenever you want from the day you to take the contract. But actually it’s after 14 days of purchase. Falsely advertised.,1
"Customer for 5+ years and the experience goes down every time I roll off a contract. Coverage and features of the service, generally very good. Customer service and the transparency of billing and switching, terrible. Really struggle to get the best deal, and billing transparency is next to nothing when there's a change - email updates do tell you what it's going to be, but not why (or even if) there's a change.",1
Mobile phone providers are all pants lets face it however O2 have impressed me by now auto moving you to SIM only once handset is paid off not like the rest who just take the extra profit until you realise or pushing upgrade onto you - reception could be better!,1
"I have been a loyal 02 custome for over ten years. Yesterday I wanted an additional contract for my 14yrs old son. I spoke to a gentleman called Tom. He was very helpful and professional. As we were about to complete the deal the system went down and he could not proceed. He apologised and kindly asked me to call back today. I called back this morning. I was holding on for over 30 minutes just to speak to someone who was inpatient, not will to help and would not give consideration to the conversation I had with her colleague the previous day. So I had to choice but to contact another provider for a new contract for my son. I'm really disappointed and would not be renewing my contract with 02 when it expires",1
Download speed is mostly ok but upload speed is useless max I have seen is between a shocking 0.1mbps to Max of 10mbps sure this service is cheaper than Vodafone and EE but have to remember that you get what you pay for customer service not good either you will be waiting over 30 minutes to speak with someone and there is no function like Vodafone to receive your call back in turn I have just moved to this network it is cheaper but service is so so,1
"Website is awful. PAYG top up won't allow you to paste a credit card number in, then moans you have typed the number in wrong. Wouldn't be an issue if you would allow the number to be pasted in!Then there is no way of contacting them to provide feedback on this, even the complaints service is hidden behind some live chat thing, just want an email address at least. Not hard really.The irony of this review is the notification box at the bottom is the only place I have spotted an email address for O2!",1
"Been with O2 for about 10 years and honestly they're average as far as phone networks go, like I've never actually had much issue with the network itself but I will say if you go anywhere out of London your signal will defo suffer as oppose to being inside of London. I'm planning on leaving O2 soon not for the network coverage but the price of paying off a phone, my family have always been with O2 and me and my dad have always gotten our phones from O2 but as I've gotten older I've realised how much you overpay, and it stems mostly from paying your for your phone over a long period, I currently have an IPhone 12 and got it from O2 and honestly really regret it. The problem with paying off Phones is the fact that they go down in value from year to year, so I've now given O2 around 600+ pounds for a phone in present day it's worth about 200, used which is insane, obviously tech does do go down in value as it gets older but wow a 400 pound loss is very bad especially cause eventually I am planning on selling it and buying a newer phone, there's also the sim costs which are completely overpriced and stupid O2 seems to have a minimum that they want you to pay cause in some cases 8gb of mobile data will be the same as 4gb in price and will go down very little in value which isn't good if your attempting to save money by cutting off data that's not in use, there's also no incentive anymore for me to stay on the same network as my family or people I talk to as lowered pricing for texting and calling for people on the same network really don't exist anymore as most people are on unlimited contracts as it's literally cheaper. I'm mostly likely going to be switching to a lesser known network which picky backs off of the Three network like Smarty or Honest Mobile due to their less expensive and non contract nature and saying goodbye to O2 cause it's wayyy to expensive to justify using. Thanks.",1
I had £10 PAYG bundle and I think o2 a very good reliable network but have they still got that really silly voice message at the start of every call you make that says 'BUNDLE CALL' nobody's going to want to hear that when using phone. This has gone on for years and no other network payg make you go through this annoying garbage. Grow up o2. Unless they do it to force you to get sim only contract. Will be going vodafone with no silly messages before voice call.,1
Been with these guys for a third of my life and they have been top notch for years. I have had issues with them every so often but never like this one recently which has made them loose two stars. I had issues with my signal as a mast went down near by and it took them over a month to sort it out. My work was heavily affected by this and I never got any compensation from them. As a loyal customer I expected better service...,1
"I rarely feel motivated to review a company that is neither wonderful or dreadful, so my reviews tend to be all or nothing.  Here's is a company I really have no strong feelings about.  It's reasonably cheap, the calls work fine, and there are rarely outages, but the website is a pain in the behind.  I can't honestly recommend them, but nor can I be bothered to leave them.",1
"I suffered  a delay for the transfer of my previous phone number to the O2 SIM.   The online support was not at all useful but when I was eventually able to talk to an O2 human, she was polite, efficient and helpful.O2 owners and managers should not believe that their IT systems will ever be as good for their customers as  a human agent.   Only the simple queries can be properly dealt with via their support line.",1
"4G signal is terrible considering that they have low bands, 3G signal is great but when you're getting 1.4Mbps down and 0.6Mbps up its pretty useless and even when 4G signal is good the best I get is 5.7Mbps down and 0.1Mbps up. Avoid. I left Three for these and shouldn't have bothered.Now down to one star, numerous reports about the network issues, many texts saying work is happening in the area only to find no improvements what so ever.Offered a reduced package which I am happy with (less data), since now I've taken out broadband. Customer service on this occasion was actually spectacular!",1
"Overall Average, their contracts are sometimes a little expensive for what you get, live chat experts half the time can’t answer your question which slows things down, Connectivity is average not the fastest speeds slow at times. Just a very basic and average experience overall. Not sure if I’d recommend O2.",1
"I got lucky on 2nd attempt and the lady was very very professional. But the first person was an animal. As a NHS worker feeling the strain I understand why, but that doesn't make it acceptable. I have spent several years in NHS and also in the Financial sector prior to that and treat people as I wanted to be treated. So o2 either you working your staff to hard and need to sort your capacity or you need to give some vial people the boot",1
"My husband needed a new phone, so went to Worthing O2 shop. Service couldn’t have been better (5 stars for them!!) , in that they were really busy, so very nice guy in there took phone number and said that he would ring when an advisor was free, to save hanging around in the shop. We were then dealt with by Victoria, who could not have been nicer or more helpful. HOWEVER - I then tried to contact O2 Customer Services to compliment the Worthing shop. Ended up completely defeated by impenetrable system (NO stars for them!!) - maybe I won’t change my phone to O2 after all…..",1
"I've been a SIM-only customer for a year, which I got at a fairly good price (20GB for £21). It's a good price (considering it's O2), but the coverage is not what I remember of O2 to have before. It's been pretty disappointing, especially when commuting, and making me consider switching to other providers when my contract is up.",1
"Called up to cancel an airtime plan which I no longer had a use for. Initially I was advised that I could not pass security and therefore could not cancel this, I then spoke with someone else, went through security fine (my answers had not changed) and have managed to get the matter resolved. I really do wonder what nincompoops get employed here at times!",1
I’ve always been a bit of a fan of the O2 but when they tried to Renew my car insurance with a card which was obviously out of date and then charge me £20 to renew it I think this is less than business like they have charged me now the £20 saying it was my fault that I didn’t give them an update on the card,1
I have recently left O2 having been with them for a good few years.It has been noticeable that whilst away from the home the service has been poor with O2 having no connection whilst my family who use other providers have had a signal.Although the coverage was poor I have to say that customer service was excellent every time I contacted them.,1
"Moved from EE and had nothing but hassle from day one, luckily still within 14 day cancellation period and it's headed that way. Feels like they want to blame customers for issues and once signed up are no longer interested in you.i have given 2 stars as expecting a call today to get resolution but it should be one or less,doubt it will happen and if not I will be returning their phone and cancelling my contract...O2 came back and resolved the issue, was just a bad store experience.",1
Ordered a Samsung Gear VR from the o2 shop. The check out was very painful and i had to key details multiple times before it eventually went through. If another supplier had of had stock i would gone elsewhere. Pre sale experience 1 Star.Item however arrived next day with a fully tracked service and the after purchase experience was 5 star so overall 3 stars from me.,1
"I""ve found that  when I contact O2   via the phone usually good service, but go to a branch and you""re lucky to find someone who knows what they""re talking about.Had a terrible experience at Brentwood where the assistant suddenly ran off with my debit card and made a copy of it--I managed to get photocopy destroyed. All she kept asking me was I happy with the ""service""!!! she gave.  NO I WASN""T.",1
"Ok customer service used to be soo much better. Certainly better than the other competitors. I have had a contract with these guys for over 15 years now. They used to be so good in retaining customers, however lately I don't think they care anymore. They are definitely the most expensive network out there. I would recommend go via carphone warehouse if you want an O2 upgrade or contract. The same tariff at carphone for O2 will be cheaper than actually going direct with O2. I know you'd think it would be the opposite.",1
"I've been with O2 10+ years and have an iPhone with them, so far so good in most respects. Apart from one, and it's so bizarre I find it almost unforgiveable for a mobile company. They text you your bill and in the text is a web address to manage your account. Click on that link though, and you go through to a site optimised for desktop users only. Not mobile users. Um what does this company do again:)?",1
Been with O2 (and previously BT Cellnet) for over 10 years now. Signal is always very good but recently the cost of being with this network vs other is terrible. I have NEVER been rewarded for contract renewals and by renewing an iPhone contract with them as opposed to moving network I am actually WORSE off.When phoning problems I get transferred from here to there and spend hours holding. Disappointing.,1
"Even after the cost of the 'free phones' was covered, they kept taking those rentals for year after year, without ever once informing me that, maybe, just maybe, I was not getting a fair bill for the one or two calls that I made per month. Just kept on taking the money.That is, until I wised up. And I would probably slill be  paying, except that they got greedy!!!!!!",1
"Variable service, not the phones but the company.  Sme issues sorted out really quickly, some things can take months.  I have a £10/month contract with mins, free texts and a good phone, which is well cheap.  Broadband and webmail problems have taken a very long time to sort out in the past though.  In short a good value product as well as you dont get faults.",1
"It seems o2 are very good at training their staff to turn every inquiry or question into a sales opportunity. Instead of providing a real sense of concern about a question they pitch you. This has happened more than once, but not always. When it does happen and I hear the pitch about this or that I get quite cross. I can say I have found their prices competitive and would not be inclined to switch ...unless I loose it next time they start blabbing at me.",1
"Hit and miss. Staff in franchise stores are clearly less regulated than the company itselfs employees, having contacted O2 with many issues, their complaints team have handled them remarkably. I would love to see a little more loyalty to customers like me on upgrades, and also a few less issues in the first place.",1
I have stuck with o2 since it was btcellnet and my current contract is my last. I don't like them increasing my bill every year no matter how little they say it is and I don't like a £3 late payment charge. O2 used to be about me but now it's all about the money. Shame on you O2 you could be so much more!,1
"Fair contract prices, but website as a bit confusing(used u switch to review packages and prices for SIM only contracts) on line order was fairly easy, although my number port authorisation ws slightly delayed and only way to contact was live webchat, which wasn't easy with overseas workers and some parts of the communication were lost in translation, although they did try their best and got things back on track. Using the O2 app for billing, info etc.  All in all, I'm finding O2 okay as it stands and nothing particularly poor to report-long may this continue.",1
"This is a difficult one to write because I spent a couple of days not getting anywhere and was really annoyed , I read the bad reviews and that made me angrier and I felt they were giving me the runaround . I eventually managed to speak to a person ( 3 in all) and they were so helpful it made my bad robot experience fade and my problem is now sorted . Why do large companies insist on these awful press 1 - 6 choices and then after hours of trying not getting anyone . ..... Thankyou humans for being so helpful but decision makers get rid of the robot answer machines .",1
"I switched to o2 from Virgin Mobile after I noticed a new o2 mast on Lytton Way in Stevenage about 400 yards from me in autumn 2020.  Using only 4G at the moment I regularly get 150 meg down but only get 4 meg up and pings over 35 ms which is not ideal as my internet radio cuts out regularly but streaming HD video is fine.In June 2021 I noticed that 5G was available from Three in my area so I tried iD Mobile.  Wow, what a difference, 275 down, a whopping 60 up and pings of 16 ms.  Internet radio has never been better and streaming 4K video is faultless.  Sorry o2, I'm gone for good.",1
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years now and I am always on simplicity tariff as I cant have any good deals from o2 .Thinking many times to leave this provider .. I called the customer service centre to see if they have good deal for loyal customers .I found nothing worth buying new contract from them as they are more expensive than other providers,disappointed totally  .I hope they review their prices  policy especially  towards their loyal customers .Thank you",1
I haven’t had internet on my phone since getting my new sim. I called 3 weeks prior spoke two 2 people that hadn’t a clue and one that was very rude. Got told I she would call back that day she didn’t so I had to ring back up and was on hold for half an hour. I then was meant to have 24 hr call back 3 weeks later I get a pop up saying my 4g no longer working on my account and still no internet. I rang up this morning and spoke to a lady called Cheryl where she was 3 weeks ago I don’t Know the Only person to actually solve my problem and was so lovely. 5 star service to Cheryl for helping me.,1
HelloBeen with O2 in total 8 years and never had a problem untill 3g came into use its really bad and once again local masts are over crowded with too many ppl using there data ....Only reason i stayed was because of there customer services always have tried to help but untill there 3g network dont improve goodbye O2..Plus the rpi every year they raise ur monthly bill which is total nonsenseIf ur making money please also improve ur network....Thanks O2 for all them years but im off...,1
"I've had a bit of a bad experience with o2 recently. I use my text messages a lot and some of them have taken quite a long time to arrive.O2 said that, once you send a text, it can take up to 72h to arrive. I was surprised at that as most of the time, the text messages get there right away. Sorry o2 but only 3stars.",1
"I can't say I had good service from O2 but over 2 years I never had a problem and didn't spend hours on hold. IFar better than Vodafone who made mistakes every time I renewed.I've also trailed Three, Lyca and Talk Mobile for 1 month each just to try before I by and each one was really really bad.",1
"I was with O2 a little over a month, the service was fine day to day, but I live near a football pitch and every time a match was on the network would fall over.I had to call customer service a couple of times as there was a delay in porting my number over, every time I called they were really friendly and helpful and sorted me out.In the end, I'm a heavy user and I like streaming music/videos etc. and the network wasn't strong enough to handle this, so I've left. But for anyone else it would be a great network.",1
"Some good and bad things. This was the first network I used, and I used them for years. The price was definitely on the high end (bad) on the other hand, the signal reach was very strong and I rarely ran into deadzones in London. Ended up switching networks due to costs.",1
I ordered home mobile broadband with the 30day rolling contract but the process was far from smooth. It took multiple phone calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package. I had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim card which would save me some money - but I had to repeat that I did not want this and wanted the mobile broadband only. The actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least.,1
"I have never had a moment's problem with my O2 phone!  Mine is a simple one as I only want it for making and receiving phone calls and texts.  Being an only child, and having lived on my own at certain times of my life, I appreciate having knowing that I can now be connected easily to everyone else.  At the same time, I don't get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call.  Then there are the frequent competitions, which are fun, the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome.",1
Manchester Arndale store service is utterly awful. Too many bodies for very little work. The staff have a can't be bothered attitude. Majority of the staff are looking at their own phones.Online service was excellent. Omar was very helpful and managed to find us a good deal.,1
"I've had quite a few dealings with o2 in the last 12 months.  There have been some good experiences and some absolutely disgraceful ones. I find that if you get through to the overseas agents then you are in trouble, they don't seem to have had much training at all and it shows. It's something when I know my rights more than they do. Its really bad but I just usually keep trying until I get the UK based call centre. I find the live chat is the best option but even then you can be there a while if your query is out of the ordinary.",1
"I have been an o2 customer for 6 years now. Every year it gets worse...I wanted to upgrade my phone recently and it would appear that new customers get the deal I wanted @ £25 a month whilst an upgrade customers (myself) must pay £31! How unfair is this!Also, ringing their Customer Service is a nightmare! You keep waiting for about 40 minutes before someone actually decides to pick up the phone!I have been quite happy with call charges, data charges etc, just a pitty that I do not feel valued as a long term customer.",1
Been with O2 for a quite a few years now (mobile phone & broadband). Have had really good experience with broadband support when needed but recently have found their prices increasing making them the most expensive of the popular providers rather than the value provider they used to be.,1
"Been with o2 from 2016 and that time the service it was great but now the internet is very slow, (3 star only for the past experience)PS my partner has a budget provider which has better signal and internet at a lower cost.",1
"They changed my contract, said I can leave without penalties. I left. Then I have received a bill for 300£, called them they apologized said they gonna fix it. Today 300£ left my bank account.Update:Refunded.",1
"I've been with o2 since I was a child, I'm now 25. I had never had any problems with o2 until I recently tried to upgrade my phone.Without going into too much detail, they basically fudged up the upgrade and made me return the handset and said I had to go through the whole upgrade process again. All because of their own misleading sales team.I was left without a phone for almost 2 weeks as things were delayed etc. Made a complaint and they did actually resolve it well and to my satisfaction.Will continue to use o2... for now anyway...! :)",1
I have been with o2 for 12 years and originally had brilliant broadband with them too until they sold it to sky. The main thing that kept me with o2 was the original fantastic customer service. Unfortunately this has dwindled over the years…and especially since Telefonica.I have recently had two enquiries. One rep was abrupt abs made me feel stupid for not knowing the answer to my question already and closed the conversation by hanging up. The second was more helpful.I also looked for sim only upgrade options but none came near the one available on U switch- the fact they would they not offer loyal customers their best deals says it all about how the company has gone really.,1
"Lets get one thing straight.... I loved O2, the staff were fantastic but I was forced to change internet suppliers once my first year contract ran out and they had no unlimited internet package even tho I had been on one for 12 months - The old new customers only nonsense.",1
I recently upgraded my phone online and was happy that I got a good deal for the handset I wanted but it didn't arrive on the day it was expected and I had to really push for compensation for the wasted day.I also had to explain the problem to 3 different people on their 'chat' facility because you can't always get the same person and the 202  phone number on their website didn't work!The support felt very faceless to me and I didn't really feel like they cared about my custom given that I've been with them for over 10 years!,1
"I have been with O2 for sometime and the service is average for the amount I pay each month. They are not interested in helping when there is a problem and slow to fix any problems, even when it is there fault. The signal is very weak in many areas.",1
I have recently purchased a prepay phone from O2 however I had a difficult time finding their track your order button. I wish they could have listed in on their footer for easier access rather than digging deeper to how many pages I have been redirected,1
I always had a good service with O2 for 7 years on contract. However when it came to renewal this year I left as they no longer had customer loyalty discounts. So I immediately switched network (t-mobile) and it's just as good yet reasonably priced!,1
I've been with O2 since they were BT Cellnet and have always been happy with the service until recently.   O2 now default to 36 month contracts which are the same (or dearer) than other major network's 24 month contract.  At my last renewal I took out an O2 24 month contract on a P30 Pro with triple data (45GB) on a third party provider for £20 per month cheaper than I could get it from O2 themselves.  How does that work?? I even got a free Sonos speaker!!My wife has switched to Vodafone unlimited max for less than she was paying for 12gb with O2Sadly from O2 having 5 contracts in our house they will find themselves with none,1
"I switched to O2 when my old contract with Vodafone wasn't renewed as they couldn't provide a decent signal at home.The cost of the data O2 charge is crazy compared to some but the refresh contracts are a great idea! Being able to pay my handset off in smaller amounts and knowing I can 'buy out' of my contract is a great way to stay in control. However, their 4G service does need work as it can be really, really slow which isn't great when considering their data charges.Otherwise, not had a problem with their customer service team who are normally pretty good at providing advice in my experiences anyway!",1
"I have generally been happy with O2 service, no major issues, they have replaced faulty handsets without issue, but they are let down by their email/web support, which is outsourced to india and as usual they do not read your emails properly or do not understand  and you end up having to repeat yourself several times only to be told they cannot help you and you need to call support.You really need to call them from the start to avoid this issue as their phone support is email based.They are however better in every way than Orange or Vodafone.--sadly things went downhill since I posted this, so I have since posted a new one.",1
"The network can let you down sometimes - recently I had bought the O2 mobile broadband service but it never worked as well as I would have expected it to. Also, it promised free access to BT Openzone but that would never work.",1
"I  really don’t like o2, but first, credit where credit’s due:Good coverage,Good insurance,Good web UI,Good fraud reporting system.- BUT- very overpriced compared to eg Giffgaff (which is also owned by the same Spanish Telefónica company who own o2, and MoviStar- but you don’t get that in the UK)- totally inflexible plans - costs £10 for 1 extra gig if you run out!- Poor customer service; they’ve got very long waiting times. If you call ‘threatening’ to quit, they won’t sweet talk you, just try and get rid of you.- leaving ASAP for some flexible & affordable data.- Phones are pricey through them too.Addendum: you have to wonder what data leak on their end causes all the scammers to have o2 numbers. Probably using some archaic unprotected database",1
Cheap for what you get. Coverage is patchy at best in the countryside. Not for you if you live in the UK countryside or plan on travelling inside the UK. Great value for London + abroad.,1
"My phone works reasonably well with little problems. I think the value is average with little appreciation of its loyal customers, When renewal of contract is due. Its like they dont care which is to often the case.",1
"I have been loyal to o2 since owning a mobile phone. I love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where I live (in the sticks) however, the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly frustrating. They couldn't understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn't helped the problem at all. Next time, I think I will send it to HTC directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when I explained it to them. Apart from that, o2 are still a good company, but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors.",1
"It took them ages to activate my SIM card... Very annoying. Now everything is ok, but I wouldn't buy a new SIM from them again. And the online customer service team wasn't very helpful...",1
Had no issues for 12 - 14 months... started to experience network issues in my place of residence...at 1st very helpful but then the online gurus started to become increasingly uninterested ... for want of better words... I have  3 x O2 contract mobiles in my home ... when sitting them side by side ... 2 x have 3 to 4 bar reception whilst mine has 1 or none and when answering a call the phone dies.... I hasten to add that no call problems previously.... Was told not their problem you receive a signal out with your property so they have fulfilled their part of the contract... not acceptable I'm afraid .... have been loyal customer for 20+ years with O2 and BT mobile before that... another custo er lost as soon as contract up in July...,1
I just got a sim only contract with o2 under the assumption that I would be able to use volt with virgin media to double my data (as advertised).Unfortunately they do not tell you that if you receive any other perk from virgin media this means that you cannot use this volt feature without disabling the other.This makes zero sense considering it’s a different company.They really should make this known.As it is they actually say not to try and activate this feature until 14 days which seemed very suspicious to me (hence why I rang the moment I got the contract).The 3 stars is for the actual service which is very stable and is actually faster to respond and load media than my three sim but lacks 5g anywhere in my city or surrounding areas so I can’t give it full stars.Unfortunately I will be cancelling within my 14 day window due to these issues.,1
"I have been with 02 now for 2 weeks and my phone still isn't working !Every time I try and log on it just says ""there seems to be a problem try again in a couple of minutes.",1
"I was concerned about the lengthy and somewhat overbearing security my husband and myself experienced at Jeff Lynne's ELO  gig on 20.10.18.  I of course, understand the need for heightened security in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack..  However, my husband was submitted to a fairly intimate body check and my small bag was given an extensive search rather than the  quick glance I am used to.  There seemed to be no apparent cause for this other than perhaps our outward appearance.  We are both  obviously aged over 55 and have disabilities). Our only reason for attending this gig was for a fun nostalgic evening, for which we paid a good deal of money.  Your ""customer safety"" people rather spoilt the tone of the evening to start with.",1
Previous customer. On the plus side great coverage in the areas i live and work. Down side missing the mark on pricing. Saving at least 30% by switching,1
"Went abroad and added the O2 travel bolt on to my account in order to use minutes, texts and data. Returned home from abroad to find they have charged me for roaming charges (Data) although I had the O2 travel bolt on. Spoke to customer service and explained why I shouldn't have these charges which they agreed and rightly removed the roaming charges. The dishonest part is them telling me I used my phone for Data roaming before I activated my O2 travel bolt on even though I didn't switch my mobile data on until i received email confirmation the bolt on was active. When I made the point to customer service, that it didn't make sense they didn't seem to have an answer. Obvious they were trying to make out it was my mistake when in actual fact it was a mistake on their part in order to avoid me asking them to compensate for their mistake. Will definitely be looking to move from the network once my contract expires if this is how they treat their loyal customers.",1
I got an iphone 6 delivered and on a decent rate contract. However mid contract o2 decided to increase the price and I have no get out so just have to pay this. Not happy with this.,1
"Why is it long standing customers get the same deal as new customers,when they are due for a upgrade?This does not encourage loyalty when other companies offer better deals.",1
"So I have a two year contract with O2 and I specifically told them I wanted my service capped. Since then they have invented all sorts of reasons to charge more. They have the technology to adhere to this contract but shows no interest in it as they feel they must grow their income at customers expense. The long and short of it from a £27 monthly contract my bill has been raised to £41 on account of phoning a number which cost  no more on a land line than normal rate. Spoke to an agent and paid the $33 difference who decide to revoke the fee and resume my service only to find two days later the service cut off and a demand for the £8 pounds. Been a customer for nearly two years , contract due for renewal Jan, needless to say , I will not be renewing. Thats not the best way to treat people after paying up to date.",1
"Came time to renew and phoned up to ask for the contract to be terminated. Fair enough, they asked why and went through some options.  Gave me what seemed a good deal to stay with the network and . . . the confirmation they sent through quickly did not mention cost, nor did ANY contact with them.  I didn't get a confirmation by email either about what I had signed up to.I was rather naive I admit taking their word for it.  Came time for the bills and they didn't give me what I asked for - in fact instead of it being £24 per month it was £37.  And of course, despite the 'your call could be recorded' routine, they couldn't find a record of the conversation anywhere.  Morale. Reasonable coverage and service - just CHECK and ask for confirmation in writing of anything they say. They can't be trusted in that way",1
"i emailed the customer service team, they said it would take 2 days to come back to me but i was more like 5, when they did come back they resolved my issue though.",1
"This is an appeal to everyone who may have experienced the same problem!!!A recruitment agent managed to leave a message on my mobile without letting me take the telephone call. I was in the city centre where I had maximum signal. I was holding my O2 mobile phone in my hand because I was expecting a recruitment agent to give me a call.Suddenly my mobile phone vibrated once. I was getting ready to answer the call but the call never came. In a few second I received a message from O2 to say that I had a voice message. It puzzled me because my phone had no missed call, and the signal was at maximum, so there was no problem for me to take the call. I went to O2 boutique, a technician said that it may be a problem with my SIM card. When I asked whether O2 was selling a service that would allow agencies to leave messages at will, the guy refused to answer!!! Does anyone know anything like this?",1
"I had been with O2 for a number of years, and generally their service was above average.However, I moved house, and that was the beginning of a very sorry saga.  In a period of 15 months I had 6 routers.  Each one had a different problem, ranging from getting so hot, I did not need heating, random drop outs, disconnections, and the list goes on.Finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided, I contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act together.  In fairness the customer service were every helpful, waiving the early termination fees.  But, it is only since I have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has become increasingly apparent.  Since I have changed, I am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house.  Not just sat on top of the router.This review is now a little redundant as Sky is buying out O2s' customer base.",1
"Used O2 on a pay monthly contract for 3 years. They would always offer very good discounts when my contract was up for renewal, and the customer service is helpful and easy to get a hold of. However this year they couldn't offer a good enough discount so I changed provider. When I phoned to get the PAC code, I was told by the operator I could terminate my contract anytime 30 days before the contract termination date, as there was a 30 day notice anyway. However now I have received my last bill and they have charged me for a contract termination fee equivalent to 2 months of contract. When I phoned the customer service they were apologetic that the operator I talked to didn't make me aware of this at the time but I personally feel I have been tricked into paying these fees.All in all, O2 is just as good as any other provider and offer competitive rates, but make sure you thoroughly ask them about fees before you terminate your contract with them!",1
"The website was a nightmare to use for me after mix up with my details left me with 2 different online 'identities' attached to one phone number, causing problems every time I tried to log in.  This left me no option but to call the customer service line, who were unable to help me on the numerous occasions when I called to discuss the problem.  I am not so unreasonable as I don't understand that problems occur, however I found o2's response (or lack thereof) very disappointing, especially because I had previously been very happy with my o2 tariff.  However a good tariff isn't everything, the customer support needs to be good too. I have now moved my custom to Vodafone, who have been much easier to deal with (so far) - As an (almost comical) post-script to the entire business, o2 then erroneously deducted a further, dd payment after my last bill date; they have since apologised and refunded but it certainly didn't improve my opinion of them.",1
"PAYG mobile ... cannot log in and they cannot find my number even though I use it regularly, 3 weeks ago I needed a separate mobile broadband sim while changing broadband suppliers, set up account and log in a week later to check my usage not a problem, 3 weeks later tried to log in again and they cannot find my broadband number so I cannot access my account and they cannot find my e mail address yet they are sending me e mails quoting last 4 digits of my broadband number, absolute mess and pointless trying to phone as no one answering, should have stuck with EEOriginal review was 1 star however having failed get in touch with anyone on the phone I filled in a complaint form and the matter was sorted within 24 hours so fair is fair and I have upgraded the review to 3 stars as the matter was sorted, I haven’t made it 5 stars as the problem should never have happened in the first place and there was no explanation or apology for the problems caused. Perhaps they should also open up an e mail help line for non urgent matters and save people hanging on an unanswered phone line. Just a thought.",1
"I'm not sure there's much to choose between mobile phone businesses. For every bad experience, there's a good 'un, snuck away somewhere...or maybe people only moan these days. My phone deal was up and not gonna' lie, I hate when that happens. A morass of offers and sheer confusion, lies ahead. Got a phone deal from BuyMobiles (they were easy to deal with and the phone arrived next day). However, I needed to tidy up the old O2 deal and retain the number. Step up Kirsty Fairbrother! A voice on the phone, from sunny St Helens. Super efficient, super friendly and nothing a problem. Explained, sorted...bish, bash and most certainly, bosh. 5 stars for Kirsty. So why 3 stars overall? That's just for O2. Crap upgrade offer. Live chat only, as outside our 'normal hours', I'd be dealing with someone (nice as they are) in Manila, or some such and a website that seems to be unreachable, on more occasions than should be the case, for a tech business. Well, I have my phone, I have a great deal and I had a Kirsty on my side...everyone should have a Kirsty on their side...",1
"I was with O2 for almost five years, and I was very reluctant to leave. I wanted to upgrade my phone to the HTC Sensation at the end of my contract, but the offer online was much more expensive than offers I had found elsewhere so I gave them a ring.The lady who I spoke to was really unhelpful, and told me that they wouldn't be selling the sensation for long as it was an old model (which is rubbish), and offered me an even older model stating that this would match the price of the offers I had found!Eventually after speaking to about 4 different people, all of whom give me various rubbish answers and not one of them tried to keep me as a customer, I decided to leave. It then took me another 3 phone calls to get my MAC code....!Shame about the above because prior to that I'd always sung their praises! I'd also like to think that it was a one off, but my Mum left them about 3 weeks later and had exactly the same problems!!Get your act together o2 - repeat customers are the way forward!",1
"My review is neutral as there are some good and bad points.I find my O2 signal decent compared with other contracts with THREE and Vodafone. I usually get to chat to someone quite quickly (prior to this Covid19 emergency) and they can mainly solve my issue.I recently upgraded and noticed that a free amazon prime/Disney+ etc was available for free. I upgraded and didn't receive any correspondence. I contacted them to be told that the freebie wasn't available on the tariff I have purchased. As I have other contracts with other providers, I opted for the lowest tariff of unlimited calls and 1gb of data. The phones cost was broken down over the monthly duration then £19 is added for this 1gb tariff. I didn't think too much about it until a month later then have a big advertising campaign promoting SIM only with 50gb of data for £20.O2 claim you only pay the actual handset price but the tariffs are extortionate compared to a plan without a phone. To me, a plan should cost the same regardless of the phone element then the phone is added at the true cost O2 want to charge instead of hiding it behind inflated tarrifs.",1
"Update: 17/08/23, they put my line back in service during the pandemic when I had no phone line. It wasn't kind. They offer a good service, which seems to have improved gradually. 03/01/2021 Poor service; they cut my line during the lockdown, and I had no phone left in case of a life emergency",1
"Why can't it be set up that I get informed/warned if I am about to use a service that I will incur extra charges on my bill?I have just come back from Orlando and have been charged every day I was there. I knew I would be charged for some of the days as we were away from the hotel but I used the internet at the hotel on the days we were there. I had the UBER app so we could arrange for taxis wherever we were, but these have worked out more expensive than the I-RIDE now because of my charges from O2. If I had been paying for my 12 year old daughters phone I would have incurred the charges for this too and that wouldn't have been her fault.My children know when in the UK that if they say there will be a charge for something (I.E.Game or tune download) then they are not to continue. Surely if they can warn you of this then they can warn you if you are subject to be charched if you continue with a certain service abroad. Luckily my 18 year old son has juat put his phone in his own name as I had paid for it for the last 3 years.If any of my children were on my contract and had incurred these charges without being warned I would have refused to pay them and taken it to court. This needs to be addressed so that we can make the choice to continue with or avoid the charges...??I have been with O2 for approx 6 years or more and have always found them good but this recent experience will have me checking out their competitors on my next renewal unless they change it.Originally would have got 4 stars possibly even 5 until this recent rip off scam.!!",1
"This has to be the most frustrating, confusing, overcomplicated and inefficient website I have ever experienced. Every month it's a fight to actually view the bill. When you 'sign in' it constantly kicks you to generic pages about what they do or what you can buy or changing your details, it's a labyrinthine pot luck to view what 'your o2' is actually doing. Eg, viewing a bill or attempting to top up or even attempting to buy anything you've seen on the page before?..... I'm just going to say GOOD LUCK!! The very few times I have ever managed it is by clicking the link on the billing email the very first time I've opened it and that has still usually taken several attempts. Trying to contact them is pointless, I have done so via their 'contact us' link on several occasions and had generic 'click view my bill' etc instructions (like that's not what I'd done in the first place!???) for the first couple of times then absolutely NOTHING! And, before you wonder, I have never been rude or abusive I've just said I've tried that but it's not working can you help further? The people in the shop are lovely but they seem to struggle getting the site to do anything as well! Ironically, the poor site must confuse itself because if I see another 'sorry, we are dead busy, please try later' message I will scream. Luckily I'm ultimately not that fussed as long as I can text, call and receive calls. If I was a serious mobile phone user I would be straight onto switch sites! God knows who they employed to design their website but I would ask for my money back if it was me!!! Blimey!!!!!!......6th April 2023: they have obviously had a massive overhaul. My experience of direct customer service in 2019 was excellent and their access to bills etc is now not a problem so credit where credit is due! Hence 3 stars now instead of one",1
"New phone from O2 using old mobile number.There are are 3 phases to my last experience with O21) The sales transaction went through very smoothly and I received the phone on time as stated. One minor issue with not sending me the new format Micro Sim card, but sent me a free Pay-As-You-Go sim card.2) Upon receipt, called O2 and reported the missing sim card, and that I need my old number managed by O2 to work with the new phone etc. At the time I was still using my 4 year old mobile phone. The assistant took my details, phone details, details of the Pay-as you go sim card and even details of my old phone's sim card.The O2 assistant then went ahead and logged the details and made some changes. Note that my old number is purely used for business support and the account with O2 is also a business account.The following day by sheer coincidence one of the walked in customer informed me that my phone number seems to be cut off!!!!  Only then I realised what the O2's operator had done to my 23 year old business phone number. She changed my old number with the Pay-as-you-go number so my old phone now only works with the PAYG number!!!3) Furiously called O2, a very calm operator took the details investigated what was done and apologetically managed to undo what was done, it did take about an hour before I get my old phone number back and also he arranged for a new sim card to be sent, so the new phone with the new sim card and the old number eventually worked together.In terms of marking:1) Phase-1:       4*       would have been 5 if I had received the Sim card.2) Phase-2:       0*       I am being too generous here3) Phase-3        5*       For fixing the problem so promptly.",1
"Have bought new phone from 02 for my 02 service only contract. What a farce. Had to buy it via taking out other contract and then paying it off. Lad in shop was very precise about what I needed to do and even gave me script. I followed it to the letter luckily and noted down time, name of operative and transaction number. A month later they charged me £600 for not using the contract. I phoned twice to try and get them to repay the amount and eventually had to get my bank to take the money back. Then they took it out again the next month because nobody it seems had made a note of the repayment. I've just had a third call. No manager in the office to speak to. They acknowledge I don't owe them the money but just don't seem to be able to get it together to stop taking it. Have been with them years because their coverage is good but this side of the business is totally chaotic, very badly organised and frankly leaves you feeling they couldn't give a damn.Update: On my bill for December it appears this problem is finally sorted. It took four telephone calls, an email and a visit back to the O2 shop where I bought the phone. One of the problems seems to be their billing service is automated and carries on sending out bills even when they adjust the amount in the account. A second problem is the telephone operatives are not authorised to adjust bills above a certain amount so they have to contact another department to authorise that and a third problem is that the supervisors are not numerous enough to deal with the volume of complaints so are not available to deal with you at the point of contact. To be fair, the humans I came in contact with were uniformly courteous. It appears to be the systems which require a radical rethink.",1
"New contract with slow 4G and 3G speeds.I took out a new contract with the OnePlus 5T handset and had come from the EE network. The O2 network was very slow for 4G and 3G speeds. After I had contacted their customer services, they were unable to tell me why I was receiving slow speeds (2-10mbps) on 4G. I couldn't even load the Google Homepage, I might as well have had an old Nokia as the only thing my handset could do was make and receive phone calls.They allowed me to do one of the following;Send the handset back to them and pay for one months' airtime, ending my contractorPay the handset value off, which then can be unlocked for free and used on another network.I opted for the latter, paid £438, and they unlocked my handset and ended my contract without penalty. I have switched back to EE, and back to the normal 50-60mbps 4G speeds.Their customer service team, particularly the technical support team aren't very good they told me that their phone masts were working correctly and that the network might be ""busy"" and when I complained regarding the slow speeds they made no effort to retain me as a customer and the retentions team processed my cancelation within minutes. Maybe they are aware of the slow speeds?To me, 4G speeds should be at a minimum of 30mbps, and just like home broadband packages now they should be regulated with a minimum guaranteed speed at your home address. I was lucky in this instance that O2 allow you to pay off your device and leave, but if it was over the 14 day cooling off period and I was with another provider then I would have been stuck in a 24 month contract with slow speeds. Hats off to O2 for resolving my issue and allowing me to leave my contract, I would return as a customer if they sort out the speed of their 4G services.",1
"I don't know where to start. We've seen the worst possible customer service with over 8 hours on the phone to O2 in more than 30 calls. Please read this is you ever have problems reactivating your phone after reporting lost temporarily to O2.  They couldn't reverse the blocks they put on our phones.  It ended well in the end with 2 new phones provided free of charge - which is why the 3 star rating.- Loss of phone for a few hours result in device blacklisted.- Phone found shortly after. After 8 days and 8 hours of calls O2 still couldn't reverse what they had done to the phone even after removing the blacklist. As a result no signal, calls, imessage etc... the phone could only be used on WIFI.- To make worse O2 asked the sim to be put in someone else's phone to see if it worked. Doing this blacklisted their phone too and again when O2 reversed the process their Iphone was left unusable except via WIFI. Their phone was not on O2.- After much wrangling and refusals, O2 replaced the O2 contract handset with a new one via next day delivery but denied any responsibility for the £1,100 + non O2 Iphone 12 Pro they had made unusable. Attempts were made to blame Apple and the carrier the phone was actually on.- We logged all calls (time, date, content etc..) ready to go to small claims court or ombudsman. The formal complaint process was initiated via email. An email was sent to the CEO (and a response from his team received within 24 hours), social media used and info sent a newspaper consumer champion.- Finally on the evening of 31st Jan we received a call from someone senior, professional and clued-up who wanted to help. After sending screen shots directly whilst on the call via email to them, a new un-locked Iphone 12 Pro at zero cost was promised via next day delivery.  The old phone will be returned in due course as part of the process.This non-O2 new replacement phone has just arrived as promised and with my old sim card I finally have a signal and working phone back. Thank you to who eventually sorted it out.",1
"I decided to move from SIM-ONLY to o2 Refresh, because o2 was doing a buy 30GB for the price of 10GB deal.Speaking to the agent was great. She was very helpful, polite and sorted out my package quickly.Rather than have it sent via post, I decided to collect from my local store in WEMBLEY CENTRAL.After carefully reading the instructions on the email, I went to the shop with Order number and the Debit card used to make the transaction.Once I got there, I showed my Order number, then was asked for my Debit card. I was asked a few security questions, then I was asked to supply photo ID.At this point I informed them that the email from o2 said NOTHING about photo ID. I brought what I was asked to bring in the EMAIL. The AGENT who sold me the phone also told me to bring these things and nothing else.I was then told there was nothing they could do and I would have to go get photo ID.I had a friendly back and forth with them, informing them that their shop and o2 need to get on the same page. o2 is telling me one thing...... You guys are telling me something else.I also informed the GUY that I was dealing with there, that I also have experience dealing in Customer Service, and this isnt the correct way to handle this situation.HIS response was, ""Well if you have experience in Customer Service, YOU should know better""......... LOL ........At this moment, I fully understood why O2 has such Low ratings.I went home, got my ID and brought up my email on the phone. Showed it to the staff and asked them to read it out to me. They quickly realised they were wrong and apologised....... BUT... damage was already done.They explained that their store is a Franchise etc etc etc, thats why they are more strict with security...... not sure why a customer needs to know thisIn the end, I dont fault them to much. O2 need to train their staff.But they also need to recognise that these kids represent their company and brand",1
"A mixed customer experience made at last satisfactory.A few years back, I took out a dongle mobile broadband account with O2 which I used infrequently to use during outside broadcasts for a Gospel Radio Station.Last November 2017, I asked O2 to discontinue this as I was personally paying for as a gift to the charity and use had dwindled down to 0 use.I was assured by helpful phone staff that this would go through in the next few days and to ignore any bills.  The account was to have been put on a PAYG basis.  A bill came in December then January.  I followed this up.  The helpful staff assured me there had been an issue and applied credit to cover the bill. Good...Then a bill for £.00 came in February.  My THought - What are O2 doing wasting money of course the account is cleared and PAYG.A bill of disconnection came in March for £19.08.  What?  How can you have £0.00 one month then £19.08 the next?  What are O2 playing at? A call to the friendly apologetic Samantha reulted in no answers as she could not get into the system with the info I had given.  She suggested I try an 02 store with the device.I did so today but the staff there were unable to directly help short of giving me a phone to call. The helpful Jen offered to sit with me while I called and she did until I was able to speak to someone.   38min and 6 seconds later - I think a result.Most of the time was spent waiting while David and his colleague did their best to clarify the situation then arrange to apply a credit to cover the full cost of charges up to 10 March.It is a mark of a very good company to admit when they are wrong.  This David and his colleagues have done and have tried to make good.  Hats off to the individuals in O2 who try to make good. They should be appauded.It is a mark of a very poor company when the accounting system lets its employees down and does not apply the changes customers ask for and are promised and sends wasteful, spurious bills.  If I am annoyed and inconvenienced think of the effect on those less able to pay their bills and those vulnerable.If O2 truly have made good and short of the final statement, I do not receive another bill, all well and good.  If not, watch this space.  I won't hold my breath.",1
Been with O2 for 7-8 years and I can say they have fallen from grace there signal quality is very poor cant get reception in my own home now when once they where the only company that could and the prices of contracts compared to what you get is terrible my girlfriend changed hers when she got an iPhone and they told her she want this contract then cos her old one was to much she then run up a £60 just a scam to get her of her old decent contract.,1
"I walked out of my local O2 shop when they said quote ""yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like (4S)""....so I went to Vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones..so went back to 02. No joy, no price match not even for a long term customer with 4 phones in the family...so went back to Vodaphone. They suggested I called O2 retention !!!!!! I did - they did a great deal...BUT. When the new 4S stops working the customer service refer you to an O2 shop - who will have nothing to do with you. As neither will Apple. Buying from 'retention' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with O2 retail shops.  Poor service, wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone. Only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 3 hrs and 5 calls waiting on piped music landlines.",1
"Edit: Dropped to three stars as I dropped O2 when their signal in my town went through the floor after some 'consolidation' of masts.O2 aren't perfect, no telecoms provider is, but after dealing with all of the 'big 4' top tier mobile telecoms companies at one time or another O2 comes out on top by a long chalk in terms of the coverage they provide (both 2G and 3G), the value of their products and contracts, and the customer service they provide when needed.They could certainly improve in all three areas, and particularly in customer service, but I would rate them as 'acceptable' or higher in all three areas, something I couldn't say for Vodafone, Orange / T-Mobile, or 3 and certainly wouldn't say for ANY of the 'virtual' providers such as Virgin / Tesco etc.",1
"have been an o2 customer for the last 4 years before that I was T-Mobile, changed whe I was assured that the reception would be much better than with T-Mobile, when?",1
Caravanning round the UK I was looking for a network that supported iPhone & gave good service. O2 has done this though I am surprised with the various 'blackspots' in coverage in Scotland & middle England compared to my wife who's phone is Orange. Quality/depth of service is certainly better than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than I,1
"always good service from customer service department, website really hard to use when trying to add/remove contact details on family bolt on - so would say website needs looking at by IT department. only let down is when someone at customer services say they'll call you back then don't",1
"I have been an O2 client since the first iPhone was released in the UK. The staff have always been particularly helpful (both in stores and on the phone) but a few things are lacking and haven't been improved during the time I have been a client with them:1. Mobile coverage is very poor in the outskirts of city centres, especially in the North.2. Very little offers for long-term customers, nothing exciting from keeping me on changing provider (in fact I will do so by the end of July).3. Some shops do not display real handsets! Is this a joke? How do I know if I like a particular phone when the only thing you see is a cheap plastic replica? **unfortunately this is a problem with other providers as well.",1
"Currently have personal 02 phone, which drops the 3g signal and makes it difficult to surf on the move. Work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week",1
"Due to some market strategy, O2 have decided to push the new HTC HD7. At my last upgrade I had wanted an HTC Desire HD but, as usual, in their wisdom they decided not to stock it. Unfortunately I'm at the mercy of poor signal coverage so I'm stuck with them. Hopefully the other providers will have my area coverage sorted by the time my next upgrade is due because I'm definitely jumping ship. I've already got a rather expensive plan but for some reason I have never actually paid that amount on my bill. It is, without exception, always more expensive even though my phone usage is quite low!",1
"Good signal coverage, calls rarely dropout. Tariffs are competitive too.Like many services, all is well until you need to actually speak to someone. The ""hold"" time for customer services is generally 5-10 mins and the individual at the other end of the phone can be hit or miss.I queued for 1hr 22mins last month to get through to the complaints dept only to be greeted immediately with ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"" - not ""Hello"", not ""Sorry to the delay"".When i asked if there was no way i could have been informed (i.e. recorded message or similar) without having to hold for almost an hour and a half she merely repeated ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"". Possibly the rudest anyone has ever been to me over the phone.I am still with o2 - only because I cant be bothered to ring back to cancel my contract.",1
I was a O2 customer for years but have just changed to Vodaphone. O2 do have excellent customer service and a easy to use website but the iphone coverage is very poor.I was also disappointed with the deals on offer compared to rivals.,1
I do not know what it is that you are gold or silver customer but they think they can con and trick on that talk. Want to upgrade now and they will have to do it if they have some system issues.Apart from that I am satisfied customer.,1
"I was with o2 for some years, but the network seems to have become really unreliable for me. The 3G coverage is patchy and inconsistent, and dropped calls became the norm. A pity because if they could just sort the infrastructure I would still be with them today. I get the feeling they didn't invest in the backbone of the network quite as much as they ought. Customer services are excellent though and couldn't be more helpful. Maybe I'll return in the future when the network issues have been addressed.",1
An average service. Had a major complaint when they made a mistake with a contract renewal date but it was handled well and the compensation given was fair.Customer service is average.,1
"Good choice of business phones, though tends to be pricey.  Initial marketing suggested that I would be contacted if service was an over-provision: no such contact occurred.  When my phone needed repair, it was astonishingly expensive, and my queries about why were ignored.I won't be going back to O2 at the end of my contract.",1
"o2 fine, i'm not happy that i cant sign up for 12 months,it seem's to be the same with most server's these day's which i thing is wrong,we should have more choice with these contracts,R C",1
Generally good coverage which is what really matters to me.  However this seems to have deteriorated since I first started on this network a few years back,1
"the only problem ive had with o2 , isnt really an issue with service , my problem was the choice of so called upgrade after i renewed my contract , i gave up my N958gb which was a fantastic phone , and upgraded? to the nokia 5800 xpressmusic which isnt a great phone but was the only remotely decent phone that i could get for free, i did take 18month contract at £30 a month and im really disapointed because i could have got a much better phone for that level of tarrif from any of the other network providors ,so as much as i like the service provided , i will be lookin at the other providers first then maybe try nokia",1
"They always manage to replace damaged phones quickly. Would get 5 stars if they could change my tariff without screwing up every time.Update - dropped my rating by 1 star to 3 stars. They've always allowed me to upgrade cheaply 1 year into a 2 year contract provided I agreed to another 2 years. Option gone now - £100+ per phone. Guess I'll sit out the next 12 months, then look at my options elsewhere.Edit - June 2012Another 2 stars dropped - their 3G service is just too poor. I've bought a PAYG dongle from Three - 5 bars at home of 3G, even worked while on holiday in Orkney. My contract is up later this year, so I'll be switching to Three.Update October 2013 - OK, I'll put them back up to 3 stars! We're on O2 Business,  and the customer service is excellent. Just wish the network coverage was as good!After upgrading our email server, we've had problems with the Blackberry server. No problem for them to change the tariff. New phone (Nokia 520)  for just £59+VAT.Assuming they finally get TUGO working on Business tariffs, we might even stay with them when the contract expires!",1
I only use the phone for work. if i use the phone more than once a week i'am on a good thing.I can't see why you have to top up by £10.00 all the time. Nothing worse than lossing a phone with lots of money on it.,1
"I have been with o2 for a number of years, around about 10 I would say. I am on a very low monthly tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone. They offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets. When, and usually before the contract expires, a free upgrade is offered. Both the o2 store and o2 online have very good deals with extremely competitive prices.Their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price, with the cheapest line installation around. However, one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing customers, they no longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no longer benefiting their existing customers, who may now decide to leave.",1
"I thought the way that o2 handled the whole upgrade for this latest iPhone was pathetic. They kept me waiting for over 3 1/2 hrs in the rain with no updates about stock etc. It then turned out there was none left and no one in any of the shops in Glasgow, in particular theo r I q at the fort were the worst. They treated the customers like a piece of sh&t, treating them with utter contempt. The amount of custom o2 lost out to that day should be noted, around 40 plus people walked away disgusted. It's the first and the last time l ever q for a phone. Current iphone customers who have fed o2's profits for 18mths at over £50 a month should have had the priority of first refusal on the new phone, that would have been the decent thing to do. Everyone who was an o2 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon, now that they want an iphone. It was just a cheap marketing ploy to feed o2's pathetic ego, keeping ppl hanging about with false hopes.",1
"Overall the o2 experience is good, billing and customer helpwise I have no complaints, the 3G network needs improvement and further enhancement.In addition I think the 3G Network growth has come to a standstill as o2 applied for planning permission to upgrade their transmitter not 100 yards from my house over 12 months ago and they were granted permission but still have to do the upgrade, let just hope they do it within the life of the planning permission.",1
"I was and am extremely happy at the extra care o2 put into customer services. However its disappointing that the good customer service is funded by my roaming charges. 4 days in Majorca, £230 phone bill? I even switched data off when i wasn't checking my 2kb emails. Not sure where I went wrong. What upset me more was the fact that the network i was using was 'Movistar'.. a Telefonica company (o2's owners). Disappointing o2!",1
The handsets avaliable to those that have had contracts with O2 are not that good you have better deals if you leave your contract and then get a new one.... No incentitive to stay with o2,1
"I have been with O2 since they were Cellnet. I recently wanted to downgrade my tarrif as I was paying far too much for for the minutes and texts that I actually use. They stated that I could not reduce my taffif until my contract was up. They did however say that I could increse my tarrif... They are quite happy to get more money, but won't give any back. I think it's time for a fresh network come December!",1
brilliant service. The staff always happy to help. The customer contact center is better than the instore service ant day. The service in the Blackpool store is not as good as Preston - St georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped.,1
"Overall, I don't have a problem with T-Mobile. I've been with them since their beginnings. What I have a problem with is to be insulted and lectured to by the AI. I needed to change a setting on the phone, (Which I finally figured out on my own. Not going to write what the technical support said to correct it). Thank God my Do Not Disturb turned on as she was trying to tell me some convoluted thing to do. My problem was I had changed the settings from Google to Samsung for the keyboardand voice texting. But could't change it back. Hence both were fighting for dominance. And I was stuck with repeat text messages. At least this phone wasn't sending them out like the s23 was. This time calling T-Mobile was a complete waste of my time. However, in all the years I have had them.I really can't complain. But get rid of The person who programmed the AI!!!",1
I’ve used T-Mobile military Business for twenty-five years. A few problems. One was never fixed. Our son went overseas. Now when people call my number a message says “Put these numbers into your phone to complete the call” I gave up on the fix WHAT HAS MADE ME ANGERY IS GIANT DOWN PAYMENTS. I have perfect credit. I’m disappointed in T-Mobile.,1
"Once we got our month T Mobile SIM installed it worked well, no problem there.  However, the SIM was sold as a month of use in the USA, when in fact service was terminated before midday on the 30th day, so effectively we only got 29 days use.  This was even more annoying as it meant we had no means of communicating on our day of departure.  Since when was a month only 29 days???",1
I wish I could give T-mobile a better score because they were great until I had to deal with their affiliate company Assurant for a broken phone. Assurant totally fell through in replacing my phone. So I went through 3 calls to T-mobile to get help. They did a lot of lip service how I was a valued customer but did NOT help me in any way other than offering a full price phone replacement.,1
"I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile around 8 years ago because Verizon customer service was horrid.I've never had a problem with them until recently, they refused our jump status which we pay for because we didn't want to pay more for the new plan. So therefore what I'm paying for is bull!!!!Then I got the Internet tower and they stated that price would not go up from $40 month.  I recently saw my bill and Internet was $45 a month.🤬",1
"We started with T-Mobile in 2018. Back then the service was amazing. Customer service was prompt and the CEO back then seemed right on top of things. However, after the CEO moved on, it seems like things have kind of fallen a bit… Customer service became hit or miss, home internet was offered to me, but then rescinded without me even being contacted, and the local stores in my area became not as competent as before. We recently moved service to Verizon.",1
"Experience the unbeatable power of T-Mobile! With a wide range of services, T-Mobile will help you stay connected, no matter where you are. From reliable 4G LTE data to unlimited talk and text, T-Mobile is the perfect choice for all your wireless needs. So don't wait - take advantage of T-Mobile, today!",1
"This is difficult, because I had a wonderful experience with the Bellingham WA call center. But I started in the Shoreline Midvale and Aurora physical store and have never been treated more rudely. So I would review the call center in WA 5+ and the physical store 0.  I am not sure why the sales rep was so rude but she needs to find a new job is she is that unhappy. Also she flat out lied when she said that I had to call customer service to resolve my problem. As the call center apologized and said they could have easily resolved your issue in the store.",1
"i've been using T-Mobile for past few month, it is the best network so far for me, am satisfied with the fast internet services lately. They have shown great empathy towards customer problems, strongly recommend it.",1
"I went into the T Mobile store in Fayetteville, Ga. today to get assistance with transferring information in my Samsung phone. I am 71 years old and not as savvy as the young people with computers but I do fairly well with my phone. the tech on duty did not listen to me when I told her my problem and I was told that older people "" need to start learning how to do this stuff themselves"" in a rude tone of voice. I told her sorry that I didn't want to bother her any longer. I drove to Riverdale ,Ga to the T Mobile store  where I was helped and treated with professionalism and courtesy. The later experience made up somewhat for the first experience but will not be returning to the Fayetteville location again",1
"Up until the past couple months we were always extremely pleased with T-Mobile, especially the Internet service.  Over the past couple months since we moved to SW Florida we have had several notifications about tower maintenance to ""ensure a great network experience"".  I beg to differ.  Last week there was a tower maintenance issue that completely disrupted and slowed our Internet service from 450 down to 12.  While their Internet customer service reps were very friendly, they tried to tell us it was our 5G device while all the while it was due to their tower issues.  We just got another notice about tower maintenance today.  All that seems to do is interrupt and slow down our service for days until it stabilizes. This is not acceptable when one works from home.",1
"I'm upset.  I'm a veteran of 8 + years. The veterans administration had me free phone service through t-mobile for a long time. The funding for the free phones stopped, t-mobile let me keep my number, but now I have to pay 60 a month! No problem with that,  but now I have to go prove I'm a veteran. Just goes to show, that T-MOBILE never really cared enough about veterans in the beginning! They don't even know we been in their system!",1
First I'd like to say their customer service is good.  We dealt with Drew in the Walnut Street store in Philadelphia.  He was great.  As far as the switching over from another carrier...READ THE FINE PRINT.  They say if you switch you get a free IPhone 14.  Not true if you want a Pro or better.  ASK QUESTIONS!!!,1
"I have had T-Mobile 5G Home Internet for 11 months. It was traumatic to install and took many hours. The Gateway is a small corded box controlled by a mobile based app, just plug the box in and turn on. My T-Mobile tower is 1/2 mile from my house, my Gateway sits next to a window about 10-30 feet from my devices, a MacAir book, 3 ipads, 2 iphones, an Epson printer USB connected to the Air book, and an LG smart tv. The advertised download speed is true, between 100-400 bps.The app, once the complicated passwords are renamed, is easy to use.My connection shows 'Excellent' about 95% of the time. I assume that means the connection between the box and the tower. The connection between the devices and the gateway are sporadic. Two of the ipads, uncorded, disconnect at least five times during the day, the worst is the lost connection to the 'Air Printer' several times a week. What is strange the one ipad and the tv are 100% corded and never lose connection. I suspect sharing the tower with the T-Mobile cellphone users may be part of the problem. My few calls to customer service were helpful and quick. I have paperless auto pay and is no problem. I have not disconnected the gateway and moved it to another location in the town, so can't say how that would work out. I recommend the service, which has limited locations, for the convenience, price, and listed speed, Maybe you would not experience the disconnect problems I have, a nuisance, but easily fixed by 'forgetting the network' and reconnecting with the password, There is no contract so a tryout will be easy to give up if not satisfied.",1
"I was with sprint and I didn’t have a choice of changing to T-Mobile when I was with Sprint they had a contract and I wanted to pay off my phone but by the time in the end of the contract they told me I couldn’t so I had at least my phone so many years I paid on the phone and they would not let me buy it now with T-Mobile They say they don’t have a so-called contract but if I pay off my phone early which I should be able to you still have to pay till the end of your billing so I can pay off my phone but I still have to pay for 18 more months that’s ridiculous. I would never go with T-mobile again ever if you’re smart by your phone outright, and do not get a contract. Do not sign anything with T-Mobile or Sprint  these totally take advantage of a person that doesn’t know they’re being taken advantage of !",1
"It's been great until lately.  I have an issue with the trade-in value that I got for a phone that I had that worked perfectly fine.  I just wanted to upgrade.The tech sent me back an email informing me that I would only get a 10% discount because of a display issue.  That meant that there was something wrong with the display on the phone.  There was nothing wrong with the display when I sent it.  I wanted to SEE what the problem was. When I called the agent, I was told that they didn't have that information.  That agent said that he understood my situation and could give me a 20% discount because I was such a good customer and had been and was a long-time customer.  The next billing period the discount that the agent promised was there.  Then the month after, it was gone, so I again called and that agent again understood the issue and he promised the 20%discount.  Again the next billing period the discount was there but only for a month.    The following month the discount was gone completely.  I called this time and the agent was completely rude but he did talk to the supervisor and said that they could put on the original discount but then said smugly, you should feel blessed that they put on the discount because usually when the tech said something is wrong, they don't give any discounts.  I said, Wow,REALLY?!  He also said that the 2 prior agents do not have permission in giving the 20% discount. So that was 2 separate agents that applied the discounts but shouldn't have?   I just wanted them to show me proof of the display issue.  That maybe the Tech made a mistake.    So I am really thinking about changing  Carriers because this was a total headache.",1
"As far as the cell service and internet service, they are good.  It's the supports they have in place that fail at both the stores and tech support.  When I added lines, the tech at the store told me one thing and it ended up being the opposite causing me money, stress, anxiety and frustration.  Eventually it was corrected, but geez.  He also never told me about the requirement to register my liquid screen for my phone for the warranty coverage.  He is no longer at that store.  I decided to get T-Mobile Inet, tried to order the service online, and had issues, so I went to the store and the tech told me that he could do it for me.  He cancelled my order and setup up my equipment.  However, he did not tell me by doing this my $200 rebate went to $100, which I just found out while returning to the store.  He instructed me to call tech support for any additional items needed for the Inet.  Well, the mesh needed it. I was also told that the 2.4g and 5g could be separated and certain devices will not work on the 5g.  I was on the phone with tech support and after 2+ hours, they could not figure out how to do that.  Then I went in for a warranty and was texted and emailed the product was there and they could not find it.  The tech handed it to me and said set it up like before.  I told him I did not set it up the store did.  There were issues with his capability to do that.  Then when I asked both of them about the internet and the 2.4g vs 5 it was deer with the headlights look and neither of them could help, nor did they offer to.  So back to the drawing board and figuring it out.  They are car salesmen and will tell you what they need to for the order and that is very disappointing.  At least with Spectrum they come to you and set things up.  Overpriced Inet, but they help.  I am frustrated as I can link all of my home devices to this Inet because of this issue which in turn impacts my home security.  The product the provide is worthless if the customers can't use it and/or don't understand how.  Then lets not forget the issue with the phone service (land line) if you want it.  That is a 3rd party and not explained until after you get the product.  Again, it's the techs who are not properly trained to understand and help the customer understand.  BTW, the store was dead and still no offer to help.  The playlist provided by corporate was vulgar.  I'm done now.  Get it together T-Mobile.",1
I just signed up with them a wk ago they will rush you into signing up that they for get to fully explain how much data the home internet has mines is about to run out soon but no one took out the time to explain how much was available it’s working good to be in a rural area but watch all the nice talking they’ll overlook some things in the process,1
"Mr. Carmelo thank you for your time and excellent service to help us, to solve our problem. Your Legend to help our frustration regarding the charges that we even doesn't know. We are so glad and very thankful that you can able to end up this ghost in our account. I can give 5 stars to this people that help us from the beggining until now Carmelo, John, Trey. They are smart people that we can assured help from customer service representative.",1
Being a 5g subscriber  I have been only on LTE service for 5 straight days in my area in Northern Virginia. Normally the service s satisfactory. The issue I have that  Prompts me to only give 3 stars to T-Mobile is the fact that I had to call customer service to find that they are making an upgrade to the 5G tower in my area. They never reached out to me to explain that I would be out of 5G coverage and apparently there is no time frame that I can be given on when my 5G service will be restored .  So now I am supposed to just continue paying for service that I don't know when I will be receiving? This is poor customer relations because they could have easily sent a text message to customers in this area that will be affected explaining that we will not have 5G service for a specified amount of time.,1
"Short and sweet: T Mobile coverage in my area is not the greatest. For beinging on the internet, talking on the phone and texting. I have had to hit send up to 5 times sometimes to get a text to go through.Customer service is awesome!!! Best I've ever experienced with any provider. So there it is.",1
I tried T-Mobile years ago and service was horrible.. now in 2022 it’s actually Improved quite a bit but the reason for my review is customer service.. with such a big company expanding more and more fhe customer service is horrible.. no when you call you always get someone who speaks broken English in another country and in the background it sounds like there are hundreds speaking another language.. to me this is not professional at all.. T-Mobile claims top tier service and top tier customer service.. hate to say the customer service is way below sub par.. it’s horrible,1
"Went to T -Mobile. Several displays stating I phone on us. Talked to lady and got the 55.00 a month package. First statement, 103 dollars. I go back and I didn’t say I was trading in my old phone. Well!!!! They didn’t say to get the I phone 13 on them I had to say I was trading in my old phone. After 4 , 30 mile round trips I did get the 55.00 dollar a month deal but I have to pay 33 dollars a month for 24 months.",1
"I purchased mobile hotspot with them.  Even though I canceled it they kept charging me.  I finally had to get the credit card company to investigate and they reversed the charges.  I had the email confirmation from when I canceled.  The service itself wasn't terrible, but there was times when the coverage wasn't nearly what they claim on their maps.  The 5G service is fast though so if you need that and they have coverage you won't be disappointed.",1
Service was excellent until they screwed me out of my trade in money. Was promised $300 trade in. They retroactively removed the trade in and never notified me. I just noticed the higher bill. Then they told me it was too late to do anything about it and kept my phone and money. Then two different CS told me they'd change my plan to a lower bill and didn't. Last straw... Vax mandates and firing employees. I'm out.,1
The 3stars go to our rep! He was fantastic! T mobile deserves a big zero! We have the phones for 2 days. Most calls dropped or no service. We are in a large city. We had Verizon for over 12+ years. Never dropped calls or no bars even outside standing in our street! Headed back to T mobile to return the phones and then to Verizon to get reliable phone service.,1
Canceled service 7 months ago. Called today t Mobil keeps charging me. Spoke with Jonathan who left me on hold for over 1 hour. He did tell me account was cancelled. I ask why t Mobil keeps billing me. He could not answer. Save yourself the trouble use any other providerHorrible customer service and any service.Should be ashamed how dishonest they are,1
"I dud call customer service tonight , and expend time to ask about new promotions, it was fine , but the service representative was no nice , because I did ask different questions and he star to getting nasty and unpolite and I was trying to purchase two phones on line and suddenly, he hang up the phone conversation on me , that is the problem with some representatives from tmobil overseas , they are not patience and they don't care abd this give a bad name to your company !!, they should hire better people and more educated ones and more professionals !!!!!!",1
"The service is fine, customer service is fine too. What pisses me off is they say when you order a new phone it will he 2 days maybe 3 days until you get it. I ordered it Monday and it literally just shipped today so wi won't be getting it until this Monday.. thats my only issue, if you state something your going to do, I expect you to do what you said...even more so with a company such as T-Mobile.",1
"Thanks for all the reviews. I was just about to accept their promotional offer of paying off my current phones to my provider, ATT. My wife suggested I look at the reviews first. Glad I did. I will not be switching over to T-Mobile based on all these negative reviews. They were very helpful.",1
I have been a t mobile customer for 7 years. I am happy with customer service and there prices. What I am not happy with is that someone was able to add a iphone to my account on 3/6/2021. And again on 5/4/2021 because the person that the store did not follow the added instruction for my account because i am a victim of identity theft. I am supposed to be the only one who can make changes to my account. As much as i like them i will be leaving them if this happens one more time.,1
The 4G service has really declined over the last few months after they focused more on setting up 5G in my area. I have an old iphone 7 and don't have 5G. My 4G LTE data is sooooo sloooooooow it's rediculous. Now I have to get a new $1000 phone in order to get decent data.,1
"T-mobile is an upgrade from the pre-paids like boost and straight-talk (I've used both).  Phone coverage is much improved.  But the data rates are lacking, even off-peak.  If you want to game you will need to do it when most people are at work or asleep in your area, otherwise you are getting powned by the zitty kid with the strong wifi connect.",1
"I read reviews about their dishonest warehouse & YES I CAN RELATE. I gave them a 3 star because they at least fixed my monthly rate for 2 months now after i called this in 8 months ago. Soo for 8 times, ive had to call, explain MY SITUATION, & stay on the phone for about 20 minutes OR MORE with DIFFERENT ASSOCIATES before the last one literally had managed it for 2 months now. BUT, the previous phone is STILL not off my line. They should send it back to me since i paid it for so many months before they adjusted the prices.",1
Wednesday I was here 3:00 and half hours had to come back today and they still got me and other people waiting.Here I am again. Just don’t make no since. When are these companies going to ever learn. Pay your employees more money and stop trying to work the ones you have to death. SMH. 🙁,1
"I had to send back the tablet that wasn’t right for me and since I paid initial payment for this iPad I need my money back.Looks like the Refund process in TMobile is terrible. I am waiting already 2 months...So I was charged in 1 min, but refund will take 2 month or more, still not sure when I will get it back . 😐 So my advice Think Twice if you’re not sure you Really want  that or other type device or you will wait to get your money back  money long time and spend time on calls.Definitely needs improvement.",1
"I refer a friend to get $50. But when I claimed the $50 they refused to give it to me. Another incident, I went to a T-Mobile store to make a payment. That young lady, one of the staff took a picture of my account with her personal cell phone. I asked her why she said because this computer is not working and I wanted to go to the other computer. I asked why did you take a picture of my account using your personal cell phone. She answered me in a non professional way. I put in a complaint with T-Mobile but they never got back to me and the staff is still working in the same location.",1
"I am annoyed with T-Mobile right now, they recently expanded international plans so it's great when you travel buy they got rid of a lot of calling discounts for different countries... I wound up with $60 of overages on my last bill because they failed to inform me. they did credit it but I'm still annoyed cause now I need to use Skype to call my family back home.",1
"Just started w/T-Mobile about 3/ 4 month. Been w/ US cellular for years, always having to watch for extra charges / changes on monthly bill, never the same.  T-Mobile- great friendly customer service, wish we could get better phone service, may have to change to another carrier due to running two businesses from cell phones.  Need more / better service from phones, I hope they can pull it together, I love my new phone, seems better set up.  PLEASE pass this info to the top to get some changes made fast....highly depend on phone service!  Thank you",1
I will never go into this store again.  They had little knowledge of the plan I wanted and one lady said it did not exist. They were the most belligerent employees I have ever had to deal with. I wanted to discuss a problem with the manager and he would not come out of his back room. Definitely not an asset to T-Mobile.  I went to the T-Mobile store in Deland and what a difference. Two ladies were extremely knowledgeable of the plan and very helpful in explaining what I had to do.  They spent a great deal of time setting up my WIFI Hotspot device in which the other store said it was not compatible with their system.  I cannot say enough about how well I was treated.  There names are Olivia and Stephanie.  Don't waste your time at the Saxon store and go to the Deland store,1
"I have been a loyal customer for 15 years. The service is decent, but, support sucks. you finally got 1 thing right. Praises for the ScamShield feature. I had been getting daily scam/robocalls. I am no longer getting them. It's about time you got something right.",1
"T Mobile needs to re-design the web site because it is difficult to use. I use the same password each time and it never works. Even after I get it to work, the system is not easy to navigate. The customer service is not any better either. The bill pay will take you all the way through with a response for the many questions and near the end, it will say...I will get you a representative but do not provide the representative. Other companies, you can pay by phone without the hassle.  T-mobile, I do not want to spend 30 minutes to one hour trying to pay a bill. Please make it simple.",1
"We've been with TMO for 4years. It's a matter of which poison do you take? All mobile carriers are suspect. However, we have 13 lines with TMO. Has been peachy, rosy and awesome? Heck NO. But we learn to work with our account manager and make the best of the situation.",1
Big shout out to T Mobiles Facebook agents. I left Verizon for enticement of cheaper more straight forward plans and coverage where I needed it with 5G. Well while prices were straight forward promised coverage was less then friendly and not there at all. I use my phone for work and personal including school and hotspot so it's not optional not to have service where needed. I reached out through the app via chat and to the local store and got the run around. The Facebook team resolved my issue which ended in a no charge to me end of my service enabling me to go back to my previous carrier. The Facebook team resolved my issue and made sure I was satisfied and are still checking in. The rest of the team should take lessons from them.,1
I was trying to get my phone unlocked and switch to Verizon. I got the phone from my boyfriends dad and there wound up being some kind of a charge issue on the account. I wound up calling and talking to two or three of the customer service people and went into the store even to try to figure out what was going on. It wasn't until I went into the store to get it unlocked that we discovered the charge. All the worker did was temporarily unlock it. So when I got back home I called again and talked to Matt in the KC store. He was so helpful and very patient. He's the best one I talked to.,1
"I signed up with T-Mobile 5 years ago and we thought they were the best company to work with as their customer service was the best I had ever experienced and i am 70 yrs old. Seems that since they were joined to Sprint the internet service has gotten more unreliable and the excellent level of T-Mobile customer service no longer exists.  You can't contact a phone rep unless you decide to give up an hour or two just on hold.  Don't even think of sending them an e-mail now, you just get an error message. I had always heard people in my area complain about Sprint and it seems as if Sprint's effect on T-Mobile has been a disaster for T-Mobile customers.",1
"UPDATE  THEY RESET MY DATA AND  DATA IS RUNINING AT 28MPS  NOW  > sold me unlimited hot spot plan  that moved at 2 MPS at times and others was 1MPS ! when i said cancel it they upped my bill $10 just to have same service  had  before and down graded data streaming i had grandfathered in,  my wifes phone only use 2 gigs a month  but her data is 3MPS most times some much for unlimited,They are a joke Unlimited is oversold it going back to ATT enterprise Hot spot and using phone App . Customer service LOL calll 3 times trying to unlock phones  and they cant get it done  will just root em  as its easier than dealing with these morons",1
I've been a customer for over twenty years. My complaint is they are constantly shoving the homosexual lifestyle down our throat in all there ads. While hoping to gain customers .,1
Our family was with T- Mobile for 4 years and things were fine and customer service reps were nice but when I tried to cancel our service I did not understand that I had some lines on the account that were open that were not in use that I was still being charged for. Each month I continued to be charged and would call and try to cancel but I kept being charged. I ended up having to pay an extra $369. I tried disputing the charge but T- Mobile sent me to a law firm. You think after four years of perfect payments they would have given the customer the benefit of the doubt. I just wanted to cancel. I will not be recommending T- Mobile to anyone I know which is unfortunate because I have six children and lots of siblings and friends.,1
Yeah. There's only a 14 day grace period if you don't want their service anymore. Thats with all cellphone services. Don't by anybody's word. I usually read the bylaws. Just FYI,1
"i would give 5 stars if danielle was the only one to help me - and 2 others whom i recommended to TMobile - move over to tmobile. i went to the 30 ave astoria tmobile and got speedy service. so i naturally recommended my brother who took out 2 lines also. however we discovered that Adam messed up IMEIs and colors so returning 2 lines had major issues. were it not for danielle we'd be leaving more reviews. bad reviews. it is not recommended to go to this tmobile unless you have danielle as the take charge person. the one thing you need is honesty, not luring customers in and misleading them. we felt adam did this. with free Netflix plus the mega mix up which tmobile took many days to sort out and only at Danielle's vouching for us.",1
"3 stars for offering service. Consumers listen...After i read online that tmobile got fined for hiding dropped calls. I had my own discovery. I called customer service several times because sometimes i had 3-4 bars of LTE service, yet no to limited data. It wasn't until my last call when a rep let it slip that there was no LTE towers within 15 miles of where i was. I believe they rig there phones with false representation and I left Tmobile. Also right off the bat i was offered a deal; buy a V20 get a free phone and with multiple lines we got a LG pad. After months i realized i was still charged. At 1st i called & a rep told me it would come off, then months later i called and rep said the deal ended. After pushing a lot, finally they upheld the deal.",1
"Been with them for 23 years. In all that time they have been great, horrible, problem solvers and lately, they are a mess! Im not gong to rehash my latest issues that have been finally resolved. This complaint is about the app. Two things. First, No way to email them. The one issue that really kills me is if I call customer service and there is a wait time, 75% of the time I will be offered a call back option. But try to find that on the web site or the app. I just spent from 6:38pm until 7:22pm trying to find where that feature is? I have been told many times to go to the app and schedule that call back. Yeah OK where? I am so angry right now. The only good thing is I don't have to be asked by the customer service representative if I would tell my friends and family how great they are and recommend them? It is better not to say what my response has been to that statement.",1
"I do not understand how I can pay for unlimited data and still get overage notices. I just got another one this morning. I do not understand why the billing practices are this way. Last time this happened I got a ""oh wow you were not on the right plan"" when I thought I was. So I changed everything and spent yet more money with them. Now here we are again almost a few years later with them telling me I'm going to run out of data.I really don't have anything more to say about them, the billing practices really do have a scummy vibe to them.Both my wife and I are starting to feel taken advantage of and it's getting to the point where we are starting to look at alternatives.T-Mob, you can do better then this. If $$$ is going to get the customer unlimited then just tell them that. If unlimited doesn't really exist on your network then stop calling it that.  This isn't right.",1
"UPDATE : T-Mobile has fixed the problem in a timely manner. Not sure if this posting had anything to do with the fix, but it has been resolved.I am no longer a ""fan"". I recently had to cancel my postpaid account due to money issues. My bill was finalized on the 18th but received a call from a collection agency today the 21st before I even received my final bill. It has already shown up on my credit report and dropped my score by 67 points. What did T-Mobile customer service say? We have no idea how your information was already sent out to a collection agency. I was planning on coming back as a prepaid account since I spend most of my data on wifi, but that has changed. Goodbye T-Mobile. And corporate was no help either. Same excuse. A loyal 20 year customer and that is what I get for doing my best to defend them... Horrible.",1
"T-mobile has a lot of fun perks that make it seem like your getting something really fun and exciting... but their network is quite terrible! No service at all in rural areas, on back roads, even in some suburban areas. We have an entire neighborhood paying for service but not getting any mobile internet or having it very limited or super slow for over a week now. I had to buy an internet pass from xfinitywifi. At least with Verizon I had a VERY reliable network, sure...it cost me an arm, a leg, and a kidney (j/k)  but I didn’t need the extra perks of netflix, T-Mobile Tuesday’s give aways , etc... I had reliable mobile internet without question. I have truly enjoyed T-Mobile’s affordable pricing, and their customer service is always super friendly but if their mobile internet issues and network issues are not fixed soon, we may be going back to Verizon.",1
Ever since they merged with Metro PCS the cell service has gone down hill significantly. I never have service anywhere and I’m not even in rural areas.,1
"Have been with them for over 3 yrs and everything was great until after paying my phones off with them last fall. Right  after that my account had an “authorized” charge in Houston for 2 newest model iPhone with all extras. I notified their fraud department and charges were taken off of my acct. Then again this week a female walked into a store here in my city by my house, and again bought 2 newest model iPhones with all extras. Both cases these woman acted and even signed documents as if it was me! And after the first theft there was a high alert added to my account which clearly didn’t work... Apparently I don’t even have the right to see the video recording of their faces - due to security reasons - even though both these crooks know who I am and even my address but my security just doesn’t concern anyone!  Lots of people telling me that it was an ‘inside’ job and I am done with this headache!",1
"I have been a T-mobile customer for MANY years...close to 20. Things have always been acceptable to me, a bit pricey, but everything always worked pretty well. I recently upgraded, and joined a 55+ program. That gives you a $20.00 break for being 55+, with a few strings attached. I already was doing what I needed to do to get the discount. Here's my complaint...They were able to fit my new equipment ($21.25 a month) into the billing cycle, but not my discount. Therefore they got $20.00 from me instead of $1.95. I don't know how corporate America sleeps at night. You can have the $20.00, but instead of a ""great"" review you get an ""average"" review. Sooner or later Karma will get you. Look at Sears with their predatory credit cards as an example. You should reward loyalty. I'm not somebody that lives and dies with my phone. I rate them as average. Nothing to rave about, and not much to complain about.",1
"T-Mobile used to have the best service before they merged with Sprint. Maybe they want to only work with brand new 5G phones. Phones that only do H+ ( HSPA ) and 4G LTE no longer get signal in many parts of the country. I will probably switch carriers so I have a usable phone. I plan to upgrade my 2-year-old phone to the Pixel 6 when it comes out later this year but I am not confident that it will work with T-Mobile either. I've always used Google phones because they have the least extra added software.There area where I have problems is in St Augustine Florida, Atlanta Georgia and l-75 going from St Augustine to Atlanta. Most of my issues are data issues. My phone is supposed to provide data for Android Auto and I also use Android Auto for my in car music. My phone issues are mostly in St Augustine where I would not be able to make a phone call from my home if my phone did not use my home internet service to make the phone call. They said there was supposed to be a new tower for southern St Augustine on July 4th but I saw no improvement.",1
"Hello, I work as an independant contractor in tech support and customer service for a high and spa company. I have been a loyal t-mobie customer for 4 years and have been referred T-mobile to many others. 4 days ago I received my new Galaxy S9. Today a client fell and knocked my phone on to a concrete surface craking the back of my phone in a spiderweb pattern. when I called about the insurance ths wanted a $99 deductable to replace it and would not cover my $1000 4 day old phone under warranty. I even offered to pay for the shipping. Lessoned learned! T-mobile does not warranty $1000 phones that are 4 days old and requires a $99 deductable after paying $1000 4 days prior. I will not refer anyone else and am now thinking about switching to xfinity mobile. I use my phone for business. My years of loyalty and $1000's spent means nothing to this company! Now off to the BBB for the legalities... Thanks a bunch for taking advantage of a sole proprinter and a fluke accident",1
"T-mobile, after the BBB got involved, you finally attempted to make it right, the check got lost in the mail one more time, and you tried to short me again (you clearly don't have enough money, just ask Sprint) but all in all you finally corrected the mistake. So I'm changing you to a 3 star.I went to get my son's phone repaired at a independent service, and they could  not do it that day, right next door was T-Mobile. So we went in and we looked in to 2 new phones on 3 or 4 lines. I chose two phones that were both approx. $250. After hours like 3 hours and a card swipe of over $700 the clerk asks me if I wanted to put the 2nd phone on the leasing program. I was blown away, I said what did the $700 pay for and he mumbled some things with a heavy Spanish accent. I asked for the receipt and was told it would be emailed later. So I just left. Now we are signed up for service have only one phone, and have no idea what is going on. In order to see the receipt, you have to create an online account. I see there are employee assist charges, activation charges, deposits. I'm all the way out. I return under the 14 day policy and they give me all the money except the $180 deposit. That will come in the mail. well its been almost two months, no refund. So I call and they finally find the documents (which I can no longer access) and do a little math, apparently on one phone that was active we had to pay $70 for service, and the visa card has been mailed out. I never received it, ok, here's a number to Citibank to report it lost and go through that whole process. I literally give up, keep it T-Mobile. you are terrible",1
"TMobile vs Straight talkSo not to long ago I switched from straight talk to TMobile. I expected to have a better overall plan, reasonably priced, and to have faster LTE speeds. About a month into using TMobile I have really not noticed a change, in fact the speeds were anything but fast. I have lost service all together many times,it has reverted back to 3G a few times, more often then straight ever did. Their 4G must not have much coverage or something and lacks the performance I would expect from a higher end phone company. I compared it to my straight talk account (it's still active because the plan was paid for when I switched)  and I did a speed test for mps. Straight talk speeds were significantly higher compared to TMobile. In fact they were double the speed. I wanted to compare playing a 1080p video running on just mobile data. TMobile had a hard time loading the video as it buffered several time throughout the video. While straight talk on the other hand had no problems playing the high frame rated video,it didn't buffer or cut out once. Now as far as plans go, I  am on TMobile one plus, Supposedly I get 2x higher speed LTE over the other plans. Now it is a great deal or all it offers,10mps in flight LTE, I can text and what not in other countries, and and if I add another line they pay for Netflix.  But the plan is only $75 and I pay $90. What are the $15 in fees for? What are the fees? Straight talk offers unlimited high speed LTE, talk and text for only $55 and only has about $5 in fees. Ithink it's safe to say (for me anyway) TMobile still has a ways to go before their service is better. I think I'll stick with straight talk for the moment.",1
"Honestly, T-Mobile has been a great service ever since I switched over to them from Sprint but their ""360 Protection"" plan is an absolute scam and complete waste of money. I was paying $13 a month for a year a half after after I broke my previous phone and figured why not get insurance so the process is simpler and I can avoid having to pay full price again for a new phone. My current phone finally breaks and I find out that my $350 phone (now not even worth $120 brand new) won't be replaced without paying a $100 deductible. I could understand $100 maybe if I had a flagship phone but this was just insane considering I found my phone refurbished and like new selling online for around the same price.Long story short, do NOT get the phone insurance unless maybe you have a really expensive phone, and even still, I can see them still charging a ridiculous deductible that almost negates having the insurance to begin with. I mean, even with my middle range phone the deductible was more than it cost to just get another phone online. So yeah, do the math, $13 x 18 months = $234 that could have bought me the brand new version of my current phone where T-Mobile is simply giving me a pre-owned refurbished phone and STILL charging me $100 for the replacement, so really, it's costing me $324 to get a crumby replacement when I could easily buy an even better phone than my current one, brand new.So yeah, I give T-Mobile 3 stars because I love everything else about them but their insurance is just an awful scam. Too many hoops to jump through and then they'll still charge you through the nose just to get an even worse version (refurbished) of your current phone. Assurant is the company they use for their phone insurance. I know my rage should be focused solely on Assurant, but T-Mobile did decide to use them, so they still get a lot of the blame.",1
"Hmm, some of the experiences I have read here are what I experienced with Verizon! Verizon is the reason I switched to T-Mobile! I was with Verizon for 22 years with a perfect account (no lates or anything) and since 2017 it has been an absolute nightmare. Customer service is literally impossible to reach!I switched to T-Mobile about one month ago and the experience from day one has been the exact opposite of Verizon. I started calling T-Mobile a month before I switched peppering them with questions and concerns and being very skeptical. I heard promises that I also heard from Verizon which made me hesitate, but there has been one difference: T-Mobile has made good on every one of them! Customer service is dead easy to reach and every rep before sale and after sale has been personable and professional with the juice to get things done!I just got off the phone with them again telling them of my experiences with them and strongly stating that I hope this is not just a honeymoon! So far, everything they have promised and done has been backed up in writing as well!As for coverage, I was reluctant to leave Verizon coverage, but so far T-Mobile has proven to be at least a close second if not equal! On top of that, my monthly bill is $8 less than Verizon and I have unlimited minutes. With Verizon I had 700 minutes (although I never came close to using even 100 minutes in a month).So far, T-mobile has been a pleasure.UPDATE:Well, I need to lower my star rating by at least one. I have now been with T-Mobile for 1.5 months and the writing is on the wall now. I’m afraid it may be the beginning of the end for T-Mobile. I have recently started receiving ads via phone and email for “T-Mobile medical alert alarms” and “T-Mobile Banking Services”.Neither of these have anything to do with mobile phone service and represent a desperate money grab attempt. Too many pots on the burners and a few will boil over. I have seen this happen over a hundred times with other companies, both similar and different. They start offering unrelated services and get overwhelmed with negative experiences because they lose focus on the core business. Eventually, customer service suffers to the point of disappearing all together and employee moral goes in the toilet as all the service reps and technicians are fired. Customers can’t get help and eventually the company goes under. Sometimes it takes a few years and sometimes a few months.I left Verizon after 22 years due to this exact thing. They no longer have any customer service and tell you flat out that they don’t care. They don’t even have a customer retention team anymore!Next, I expect to see T-Mobile offering car insurance, life insurance and other scams.If T-Mobile keeps going down this path, they will fold. I’ll be leaving them before that happens.",1
"Update:  hurray!!!  T-Mobile credited our mobile account $784.94!I posted a story on the company’s FB page with hashtag TMobile and their customer service page and my FB page.  This detailed the facts on our reward and how we did not receive what was promised on the Bring Your Own Device promotion this last Fall (which is a current program too).After waiting over the requisite month for the reward payment and reaching out to Tmobile multiple times I was repeatedly and firmly denied by customer service at all levels in all departments.Having had enough frustration with “customer service” I reached out to the BBB and the FCC and was at the point of contacting our State’s Attorney General.I might note too that I did get an immediate response from the Tmobile T-force team when I hashtagged TMobile on their Facebook page, my FB page and the Tmobile customer feedback page. After lengthy messaging (don’t give up on that thread of communication) the T-force folks promised to try another claim and offer a full credit as a last resort in 2 weeks (which was today).I highly encourage anyone who gets shut down by Tmobile when you file your claim for reward to not give up. Hit them from the social media side and/or the offical complaint side with BBB.I was thrilled to get what was promised and look forward to a better relationship with TMobile.Don’t give up!  And let me know if you need encouragement in your attempt.Here’s the original story:We have been customers with another cellular service for nearly 20 years.  There are 4 phone users in my family.  We made the bold move to “bring your phone” to #T-Mobile and paid off 2 of our remaining contracts and were promised we would receive up to $800 for the move to T-Mobile.  Before crossing over to the new network we sent in our screenshots to T-Mobile and filled out the paperwork.  We were advised we would need to wait 6-8 weeks for the credit from T-Mobile.  After waiting for 3 months we called customer service and were told our paperwork was never filed and that we were past the one month deadline to re file our paperwork to receive our promotional amount.  When we were transferred to the promotional dept they said the same and that customer service would “escalate” this case and contact us.  No contact.  We called customer service in another week or two and were now told that the 2 month deadline had elapsed 5 days before our follow up call and that nothing could be done since we missed the deadline.  All this to say that we filed everything the day T-Mobile got 4 new customers to sign up with them.  They did not send us any of what we were promised, denied receiving our paperwork, told us we only had one month to file the paperwork, then told us they had extended that deadline to 3 months, and then told us that we did not meet any of their deadlines even with repeated calls to their reward dept and their customer service department.  I spent over a 6 hours speaking with representatives at T-Mobile feeling like I had when I was with AT&T.  I had hoped we were not dealing with another corporate company who just shuffled us around, but I soon learned T-Mobile was treating us the same way: with little regard for us as long term customers paying monthly.  We did nothing wrong on our end.  Is this the way a phone service treats its newest LONG term customers?  I will tell everyone our story when they say that T-Mobile is making promises to get new customers!  This might help you consider too what phone company you would like to pay monthly for multiple years.",1
"I have been a Sprint customer for 16 years and recently became notified via text message that I had to acquire a T-Mobile SIM card as they have merged. The options were to have the card shipped to me for $10 or to go to a store. I chose to go to a store to avoid the shipping costs and reduce the possibility of error. The closest store is about 30-40 miles from my home. I went to the store and was given the SIM to take home. The woman in the store told me how to do it and told me where to go to watch a video on the process. I asked her to do it for me, she would not, so I went home and watched the video to do it myself. **In small writing on one insert in the SIM card box, it states that you need to back up your voicemails or you will lose them. It does not say this in the video, and the woman in the store did not tell me. I did not notice and I lost all of my voicemails. That is not the purpose of my review though.** I put the SIM in my phone exactly as instructed, and my phone no longer worked. It would not connect to wifi. It would not connect to service. It was a locked and useless piece of technology. I used my landline phone to call customer service. I remained calm and tried to work with the agents to restore the use of my iPhone. The first agent attempted to assist me for 6 minutes before disconnecting me. I called back and got another agent that was especially kind. She attempted to help me for about 25 minutes before determining that she would not be able to assist me because I did not have a way to receive the one time code that she needed to send me in order to verify my account, and apparently my SIM card was faulty/did not exist. Because my phone didn't work, there was no way to receive the code to dive further in to this issue. We eventually found a way for me to receive the code, which was done by me emailing my mom from my laptop to ask her to receive the code and send it to me via email. She put me on hold to discuss with her team and then transferred me to another agent without telling me she was doing so. The new agent was not briefed on the situation so I got him caught up to speed and he attempted to help me for about 55 minutes, in the process, he guided me through phone resets that were unsuccessful in restoring the use of my phone, but they were successful in removing every setting, password, and face ID that were in my phone. He did not tell me that that would happen. At the time, I was just wanting to restore the use of my phone and wasn't even focused on the extent of what I had just lost. He disconnected me without warning. I called back and was connected with an agent that simply informed me that there was no way to help me and that I needed to travel back to a T-Mobile store and then disconnected me. I called back and was connected to an agent that assisted me for 47 minutes, ultimately resolving the initial problem and getting my phone activated to T-Mobile service. He also offered to send me a booster at no cost to increase service in my home. He discovered that there is only one T-Mobile tower in my area (there were 7 Spring towers) and that my service would be poorly effected by this switch. I was grateful for his help and his willingness to go above and beyond to help me with issues beyond what I was calling for. He was not able to help me restore my voicemails or my lost passwords/other information, but that is certainly not his fault. Every agent was pleasant, I had no personal issues with any of them, but they were not able/willing to help me and didn't seem to really care about the situation I was in. He thanked me for staying calm and kind and acknowledged how frustrated I must have felt. I would like to rate my last agent, Christian, every star in the world, because without him, T-Mobile would have lost a 16 year customer yesterday. I spent many hours of my day trying to do what they asked of me - not something I ever wanted - and it was a major inconvenience that caused a lot of stress. As far as I can tell, the only thing T-Mobile has done right is hire Christian. He deserves a lot of praise, and a raise. Christian, if you see this - please know how grateful I am. That is all, thanks.",1
"I've had TMobile for 14 years and have seen them improve greatly in the last 6 of those. I've always lived in an urban/suburban area and have had solid signal with very good coverage and data speeds. The LTE speeds in the 3-4 years have been excellent. Their customer service approach (teams with regional focus and follow-up to resolution) is far better than the past, and I had no reason to believe that would change according to inner reports from friends who are employees.In September of 2017 I noticed a drastic change in customer service policy/procedure - more calls to 611 than in the past were routed to overseas call centers who 1) had little ability/authority to resolve matters 2) struggled with the English language in their communication 3) couldn't relate to social and practical issues like addresses that directly affect US customers - all of which became more of a 'reading off a script' experience and endless cyclical talking that went nowhere.   In addition, any Twitter support through DirectMessaging was focused on hyper positivity, lofty rhetoric, exaggerated claims of expertise, and writing too much about themselves in an attempt to sympathize and empathize in obvious relatability - all which would be fine if accompanied with competence, accuracy, attention to detail, follow through, and a timely resolution. Because of these changes in customer service approach/policy, issues that formerly took days to a week to resolve now become lingering problems that last weeks to a month or more.I moved to a suburban/rural area that is still within a couple miles of a larger city, and according to antenna search/locator sites and an app called Network Cell Info Lite, there are several T-Mobile towers in my area, from 1/2 to 4 miles away with only one obstructed by geography (foothill). I never connect to the closest 4G tower, leading me to believe it's inactive or non-functioning. Doing drive tests with the diagnostic app reveal a very weak signal being br oadcast by most of the towers in the area, and even with full signal reception on phone (bars) the latency is very bad and data speeds are horrible and subpar - more akin to that of 3G or less.All of this information has been passed and communicated to TMobile over the past 4 weeks with little more than 'there are geographical difficulties' being reported from the engineers in the field.  This is only true of 1 out of the 6+ towers in the area.  I understand business decisions of cost vs benefit, and that unless/until a large customer base was complaining of problems they would delay or refrain from addressing such issues, but it seems there exists a lack of maintenance and ongoing upgrade concern/competence.  All the happy-talk virtue signaling in the world from customer service reps doesn't alter that.So I'm now experiencing what many others in 'less than adequate' coverage areas have experienced and the apparent changes in customer support have only exacerbated the frustration and unacceptable conditions.  This is my 2Cents.You can't trust their coverage map claims which are misleading, false, and blatantly full of errors.However, if you live in an area where towers are maintained and the signal is strong, their service is one of the best.  They really need to think through and work on their customer service approach - once again.**UPDATE 11/07/2017**After multiple attempts to contact a customer care or technical support person within the US by phone, I got lucky and reached a first level tech support person who transferred me to the 2nd level support. They took extensive notes and then created a ticket to be sent to engineers - meanwhile I created such an uproar on public Twitter messages that I was contacted by DirectMessage and they requested to call me directly to resolve the problem.During all of this, I continued to search for answers/solutions online. None of the support personnel directed or linked me to any T-Mobile online support documentation - but in my searches I found what I thought might be the problem. There was a detailed T-Mobile support document that did indeed provide some helpful information and could've been forwarded or linked or sent to me within the first day or two.Solution? The Personal Cellspot 4G LTE mini tower needed a complete 'reset', which can be accomplished by holding down the reset button on the back of the mini tower for 20+ seconds.  Up to this point, I had only tried 10 and 15 seconds as well as unplugging it for 30 minutes.  Once I did the 20+ second reset, the data speeds returned to a normal level (80-90mbits down, 30-45mbits up) and all was well.  I relayed all of this information - including the support documentation URL to T-Mobile support teams on Twitter and phone support and hopefully they will begin a process of searching for 'known issues' and FAQ's while assisting customers in order to actually resolve issues and to learn themselves in the process.",1
"4 calls with Customer Services - maybe 90 mins in total - to fix a router VOIP problem following an upgrade in our Fibre contract. 16 days with garbled incoming calls.The third Customer Services agent was the first to properly listen to my narrative, check what had been tried previously, seek more expert input, and do what she promised to do.Would Vodafone please consider a small gesture of compensation for the time, inconvenience, and inability to provide a proper landline service for 16 days?Edit 19 Jan:With reference to Vodafone's generic reply, the landline issue was resolved after 16 days. I can't pursue a rebate of charges, since I don't use fB, X or Instagram. What do you propose?",1
"I purchased an 8 day euroroaming bundle recently on a trip to Italy. Data and texts worked fine, but calls…..no. I could call the uk but could not call any Italian numbers without incurring extra charges. Calls from Italian numbers to my phone didn’t connect. This made life difficult with Italian friends and family and ordering pizza etc etc.",1
"Mobile broadband service (Gigacube). Well, the good thing is I now sometimes have Wi-Fi as being in the countryside makes it difficult to good Wi-Fi, hence the 3 stars. Overall, the signal is patchy. But, during one of the windy days a pylon that gave us signal got damage and our Wi-Fi stopped working. We were without Wi-Fi for 3 weeks! My partner works from home you can imagine the inconvenience this caused having to balance the 1 car between us to drive to and from a library or cafe every day to get Wi-Fi and just about be able to work and at the same time drive to my office as I work there 5 days a week. After 4 phone calls and hours on the phone, I got a refund for some of the days we had no Wi-Fi (10 out of the 21 days). This came to £16.67. What. A. Joke. So stingy it's unreal. To be clear, I pay £50 per month for my Gigacube contract. The people on the phone were nice don't get me wrong. But damn, their slimy policies and inability to fairly treat customers will kill this company. I'll be switching at the first opportunity.",1
"I generally don't have an issue with Vodafone..calls are generally answered quickly and efficiently with politeness..which is fine..HOWEVER...Call handler put me on hold but didn't turn his mic off..to quote what he said..""We have online another complaining White trash Mother Fu**er""...THAT call has been recorded....",1
I ordered a new phone and used the click and collect service... I had a email to say my phone would be ready for me to collect 4th January 2025 - however I had no notification that the phone I had ordered wasn't in stock in the store.. I've tried to find out how long it would be for you to have the phone delivered to the store and how long it would be until my order is ready to collect and haven't been successful... Could anyone help please??,1
"First two visits were generally very positive.  In general, I get good support and service when I go in with any issues.  Today's visit was, sadly, far from satisfactory.  The person I dealt with seemed very uneasy.  The system was down, so I couldn't process or confirm what I had found online.  My salesperson used his own phone and gave me a quote which was around £10 more than my cheapest online quote.  So I did the same process on my phone and came up with my original price.....This visit certainly didn't come up to the standard I'm used to from this store.  I know it can't be helped if the systems are down, but to get quotes that conflict by such a significant amount doesn't exactly encourage a spirit of optimism.....",1
"Vodafone UK's Eltham branch has some friendly and helpful staff, like Mike and Montana. They assist well with data transfers and explaining broadband options, ensuring I felt informed rather than confused. Demi also provided great advice and support for account setup and cancellations. Overall, while the staff is commendable for their service, there's room for improvement in overall experiences.",1
"After a disappointing installation and little help in setting up, via the App and instruction sheet, it's now performing well, with good, consistent speeds.If it carries on like this for a few weeks it'll be up to 4*",1
"Appalling customer service tools. Phone line cuts me off when trying to connect to an advisor; they did call back to be fair but they couldn't provide any help as it was an 'external' call.Online chat they don't answer or it automatically times you out; times out very quickly so you need to keep typing something very frequently (they actually advise you to do that - mad). Utterly useless.Finally got my issue (regarding PAC) thanks to a very helpful advisor called Christine, so that's one positive point to feedback.",1
"The telephone Internet get worse. I am at my home in York City centre and I have no Internet every afternoon and now on a Saturday Sunday very little in the morning  and evening always unstable,  the quality and reliability has drastically reduced in Poole  Dorset too.All the local shop can say is it when the network is very busy.  I have had a new sim card and my phone is a new samsung galaxy...I know many others are commenting too ...the service provided is not fit for purpose.I had no stable Internet until 21.00hrs on saturday all checks have been done just too busy on the network your shop tells me.",1
Ok but constant issue with phone calls dropping and 4/5g connectivity problems. Was with EE before and never had any problems at all. Certainly needs some improvement to make me sign another contract,1
"If you have the benefit of speaking to a UK support team the experience is personable and professional.However the website/app experience is dreadful.The painful experience of attempting to log onto your account is a real put off. Codes, usernames, one off passwords, PIN numbers and I could go on.As for the on line chat Bot, Tobi, it must be the most useless experience and waste of time. Don’t even bother trying to communicate with it, ring the call centre direct.",1
"They are expensive, do not reward long customers, deal with problems badly.After 22 years I am ending my association with Vodafone. I have been charged an inflationary price for sim only and mobile internet which I can save 30 pounds a month by switching. When someone hacked my phone and ran up excessive 0800 calls over my monthly contract, Vodafone dealt with it clumsily, restricting my phone access until they received payment on two separate occasions.No apologies were offered when I complained.",1
"Update!Having posted on Trustpilot about being charged for a phone contract that had been cut off, I had a call the very next day from Vodaphone saying that they would refund my money as clearly there had been a misunderstanding and I shouldn't have been charged. A great result.",1
"I've been with Vodafone since around 2011 when i got my first iphone and my experience with them has genuinely been good altough data signal has been bad this last year, my contract came up for renewal and i wanted to go to a pay as you go, they told me on the phone i couldn't switch and keep my phone number and offered me deals that were too expensive with either too much data or too little so i switched to O2, i now am paying less and i also get 5G ! i never got 5G with Vodafone even though i was paying for it for 2 years, i would only get it if i was in my town or a city. Happy i swicthed after all these years and disappointed Vodafone couldn't help out a loyal customer.",1
"The service I received in store was very direct and didn't have to wait to be seen.The shop assistant that served me seemed initially very uninterested and condensing towards my questioning. I felt almost patronised against because  of asking whwt he odvsiously deemed as silly questions made clear from his eye rolling and huffing. He even kept dropping my bank card on the table instead of handing it back to me as well as the receipt being folded and casually thrown across to me.He clearly picked up on my mood changed in reaction to this and clutched at some sort of small talk which frankly I had lost interest in. I just wanted to get the upgrade sorted and leave the store by this point.I will have to go back to the store in a few months for a device upgrade, but really do not want to be served by this staff member.He did do what was asked of him but I felt rather belittled by him.",1
"After one month of confusion in which I spent hours on the phone trying to prevent Vodafone from cutting me off, I give credit to their staff for trying to resolve the issue and offering me a generous compensation payment. I won't know till next month whether the issue has finally been sorted out but am keeping my fingers crossed. No problem with the technical side but the administration has been chaotic.",1
"Vodafone Blackburn Town Centre, nice and helpful guys but the system is rubbish. I waited a lot because the system was not processing the info correctly",1

"Most of the time it works ok, I got a good deal on my top internet speed which is stable most of the time, however can't say much about their app. I put it on a new phone yesterday got it working fine then today I try to sign in again and it wants all my details again like a lost password procedure, I know am retired but I still don't have all the time in the world to be faffing around with sign-in procedures. I've taken the app off its useless. I wanted to chat with someone as my landline is not working, the phone works at my daughter's but not here. The issue is obviously with Vodaphone. Update: Thanks vodaphone I did try that but it still wants me to go through all the sign up procedure again. My landline is now working now anyway.",1
"Let's be clear, the operator in the shop was extremely attentive, several years of experience of the software, knowledgeable & helpful. Clearly the computer systems they are working with are old, cumbersome & slow, which hampers shop staff in handling enquiries & making sales efficiently & speedily.",1
"Well, I'm rather disappointed. I wanted to join Vodafone, but after less than 24 hours, I've canceled my SIM card. The coverage checker and my signal don't match up, and it's the same as my current provider, only twice the price. If they had reduced the price by 5 pounds a month, I would have continued with my 24-month contract, but I'm not paying double the price for a marginally better service! It is great that you offer the 14-day cancellation period, though.",1
"37 minutes to renew broadband contract, like for like.  How inefficient for both Vodafone to have a chat agent tied up for that time, but also poor customers who have to go through the painful process.If I can renew contracts elsewhere with just the click of a few buttons, why does it have to be so onerous with Vodafone ?",1
"Couple of weeks in and unable to make outgoing calls on landline at the moment ? In fairness, complaints are very quickly acted upon but having tried on several occasions to see what the problems is. I changed to Vodafone as they were offering a much cheaper service and faster internet, although I've since found out that the figures quoted are based on cable connection rather than wifi ? who connects with a cable these days ? very misleading but presume other providers do the same ?",1
"I bought a sim only contract. My worst ever experience with any mobile network. It’s 4g network. When I bought it I wasn’t aware that it is 4g.

Thousands customer like me just paying these companies for nothing.",1
"I did not apply for £150 gift card in time because I received a no fault eviction notice and so I was worried about becoming homeless.  So I had to put all my time and attention for months on to finding somewhere to live and moving.  After several calls and speaking to a manager and they did nothing.  Even though I explained this is a lot of money for me as I’m not able to work due to health reasons.Also, I moved home and had a new line put in.  I had to stay with Vodafone because I had a contract.  I was without internet for about 5 days.  The engineer burst my heating water pipe.  After the pipe had been fixed, all the water had to be drained from my heating and then the heating had to go on maximum for an hour.  Then it had to dry out for weeks before the wall was plasterboarded and painted.  It took so much of my time up and took months to be resolved.  I received £3.90 of compensation from Vodafone!  AVOID VODAFONE BROADBAND PLEASE!Update it has since been half resolved.",1
"Decided to change our broadband to full fibre with Vodafone for a ""seamless transfer."". Two lads turned up on the day, on time, layed the cable, drilled the necessary holes and tested it - didn't work. An obstruction in the cabling down the road was diagnosed. We were told a man would arrive the next morning to sort it.Nobody arrived, nobody contacted us. Eventually I rang Vodafone (not easy!) and got through to the installations team. I was told that there was a problem in the cabling (we knew that!) and that someone would call to resolve it on 12 November (13 days later). That we didn't know! No amount of arguing could persuade them to do it earlier; they just blamed City Fibre. I ended the call very frustrated and not a little angry. No contact from them since, no confirmation of the 12 November, no faith in Vodafone. That is a ""seamless transfer"".  MORE - I have added a star as the Trustpilot review galvanized Vodafone into action - we now have broadband up and running. BUT the phone line doesn't work! I have phoned twice, received assurances, even called in a Vodafone shop, but still no telephone. Will contact them again later in the week but very frustrating.",1
"Spent hours trying to cancel my upgraded broadband.Passed from dept to dept and still no further in after hours.To renew or take out the contract was perfect but customer services seem non existent when you need to cancel! very disappointed with Vodafone.  Used to be amazing customer service.Updated, managed to get through to a really helpful advisor who understood and fixed the problem.  Need more guys like this!",1
"This review would have been no stars out of five if it wasn't for Jack and his manager at the Vodafone store in the Grand Arcade, Cambridge. Thank you to them my problem was fixed. Was left feeling frustrated by making a number of calls to 191 after i lost reception in mid December and numerous advisers trying to resolve the issue. Now waiting to learn what kind of compensation Vodafone will offer for being without a service for the best part of half a month.",1
"There seem to be plenty of areas where improvement would definitely help ratings!I recently waited 3 or 4 days for my new SIM to become operational,  due, it seems, to online customer service incompetence. However I would like to thank Sophie at the Basingstoke shop who sorted the problem in minutes :)One major point to address  I feel is the reliance of the customer having access to a 2nd phone to which verification codes can be sent! When you've lost your phone you don't HAVE a phone!!..........  Think about it Vodafone.",1
I have contacted Vodafone through the chat. During the 2h chatting to the Vodafone team about an hour and. Half was about security questions and connecting me to the right team. The other 30 min was just resetting the router and raising a ticket to the appropriate team. 2 weeks without internet and 2 hours lost. If you need to contact them do not use the chat.Update: I called the Vodafone team and my issue was resolved quickly and efficiently.,1
"Generally fine. Vodafone in general are a very difficult company to deal with. Spent four hours today trying to do a very simple task, so had to go into my local store to resolve. Got my issue sorted without too much fuss.",1
"Vodafone took over an hour instore with very helpful staff trying to change a sim only monthly contract to a different level.  I was told there is a problem with Vodafone's online system when a  phone number has previously been pay as you go and it's been a problem for several years.  I left the store without the issue being sorted with the promise of an email follow up when it's done. SORT IT OUT, VODAFONE, YOU'RE A TECH COMPANY.  STOP WASTING CUSTOMERS' TIME.",1
"Chloe who i dealt with was polite and efficient.However her assumed manager ( older male ?) Was less so. My phone screen was faulty and he insisted it was because I had damaged it although he agreed there was not any evidence of damage or any impact mark on the phone ( because there had been none). Seemed more bothered about been sat on his phone at the back of the store then supporting his co workers. Chloe, an asset to your store, him however not",1
"Good mobile coverage, fast, and mobile over WiFi are great, but website and app are dismal - it's like they've never been tested.  Both are confusing to use when managing your account, unintuitive, slow, and regularly crash or throw error messages.  Both are really poor - even trying to renew my contract today, both the app and website are hanging/throwing error messages.  Such a bad impression having these failures in a sales process!",1
"Efficient, helpful and friendly is how I would describe Dan, the guy who served me in Darlington. I requested that he add £10 credit on PAYGO 1 to my phone. He confirmed that I understood how PAYGO 1 works and then credited it to my phone.Later that day I discovered that Vodafone had actually added a bundle which would expire in a months’ time.I contacted Live-chat and the error was corrected by Erik.All's well the ends well.",1
"I moved my house back in November, had many conversations assuring that the old address is disconnected and contract was going to be cancelled. But they continued to charge me for several months, lost chat history. Just unbelievable.._Update_: After almost 3h in a chat, I happened to talk to a person who was able to find the disconnection request for 4th of December. Hopefully this will be sorted out now.",1
Broadband connection ‘engineer’ expected today between 8am and 1pm. No show by 1pm so called Vodafone to be told ‘engineer’ running late but will attend before 6pm. No show by 6pm so further call to Vodafone. Apologetic but offering unsuitable appointments a week hence. Finally offered and accepted a new appointment 2 weeks hence. The point is we had to make all the running with zero communication from Vodafone during the day. Not a good start to our new broadband relationship with Vodafone. On the plus side the Vodafone customer person did their best.,1
"I received great service from Vodafone throughout my 2 years, until my contract came to the end. Vodafone continued to take money from my bank account even though my contract had been cancelled and I had successfully transferred my number to my new provider.What a shame it had to end on such a bad note. And not even an apology from Vodafone when I asked for my money back.I did expect better service from such a reputable company.",1
"I would have given Vodafone more stars had I not moved to Spain, where I found their roaming charges ridiculously expensive. It’s cheaper to pay the basic monthly contract charge, to which I’m tied for two years for no service at all and use a Spanish Sim for my telephone and 4g/5g needs.",1
Been a customer for 2 yrs - broadband and landline. Connection was easy enough to set up and received router promptly. Speeds very consistent and got what I paid for 37mbp/s.However disappointed by mid-contract price rises above inflation. Also upon termination mandatory 30day termination notice despite coming to the end of the contract. For this reason Im unlikely to return - there are better value providers.,1
"Purchased a new Samsung Galaxy mobile on the 7th Dec from Vodafone store in Sunderland , travelled back & forth numerous times to get mobile working without any success . even the Store manager tried but no luck, Finally decided to return the mobile on Fri 29th Dec for a refund , Sales Advisor DONNA asked if she could sort out the problem & HEY PRESTO she did , so DONNA well done , the rest must try harder , Cheers Ann",1
Had Vodafone WiFi provider since 2020 and it was bad at first. Connection is absolutely amazing for a 4 bedroom. Before you get onto me… yes I’ve seen the reviews with customer service.. but when is customer service these days any good? Anyway back to the point. The WiFi signal was outstanding and is quite good for playing stuff online and can have multiple devices using it at once. Had things like PCs PlayStations alexas etc and never had a problem with laggy or slow WiFi with a lot of devices connected to it.Overall if you’re looking for some good WiFi I’d go to Vodafone but I wouldn’t rely on customer service.👍🏻,1
"I have no issue with the home broadband service provided by Vodafone UK. It is pretty reliable and offers the speed advertised. Their broadband hub isn’t good, but I use my own WiFi router & APs behind it.However, if you do need it, their customer service is as bad as it gets. The people you can chat to are perfectly pleasant. But they are under-trained and clearly have minimal system support. The result is that they can achieve nothing to help their customers. It is almost like they are being paid to waste both their time and the customer’s time. I also note that their TOBi pre-chat system is a prize example of ‘Artificial Stupidity’ – carefully designed to waste customer’s time. Even when you manage to connect to a person, TOBI is still waiting to get you. So, for another account security check, it will ask you for the same information again and again, because it only looks at your last reply.",1
"Do your research as vodafone mobile sim only tariff for £10 with 100GB data. It isn't  that good as it don't include ""roam like home."" So you have to pay a minimum of £7 to use your phone in Europe.I will stick with my £8 tariff with o2  with 50GB and 25GB data in Europe include at no extra cost.You would only need 100GB if you want to also use it at home as your broadband.Vodafone need to check what other mobile companies are before coming with something that isn't that good.So make sure you check what is included with your tariff.still Vodafone don't bother looking into it and come with lame excuses as usual, so be careful with Vodafone mobile tariffs as they probably are not a good deal.",1
"Why is it ( I am sure not just Vidafone) difficult to leave these companies.They make it diificult to leave. Threaten of charges which can be heavy.No one contact or tell you to contact during the day , which never have time.I have been with Vodafone for many years . Now paying far too much for the service reception has become bad on mobile data which I know it is noty phone causing this.I am considering Voxi which I believe is part of Vodafone. Nothing so simple.Vodafone - why dont you help your customers.I expect thix womt get to Vodafone but feel better writing this",1
"Bruno was great upgrading my phone to the Iphone 14 + and transferring my information, thank youBruno did do a great job at updating my phone BUT he wrote this review NOT me ! Presumably while he had access to my phone. I am not pleased that while Bruno had access he chose to write his own review without informing me. I would have happily given him a good review but this has somewhat annoyed me and I find it disrespectful.",1
"Jamie bent over backwards to help with my broadband issue.  Although not resolved in store he walked me through instructions to rectify this at home. Very impressed!However, things did not go so well at home. The online chat was tortuous and crashed after an hour - I then started another chat for another half hour only to be told to call a number.  I spoke to a lady in Egypt who was helpful but it took around 3 hours to resolve. I spent a total of 7 hrs trying to get this sorted - not acceptable!",1
"Difficult to ""score"" my experience as the individual who dealt with my query was good, BUT the Vodafone terms and conditions not so good. My contract expired a couple of months ago and I confess I was late in getting new one sorted. As a result I overpaid by 2 months. Not a huge sum, only £28, but they do not refund any overpayments until you cancel the contract. I am happy with the network coverage so wanted to stay and negotiated a sim only deal. Vodafone will hang onto my £28 until I leave them and if I don't, I guess they will keep it? I wonder how many £m's of overpayments they are keeping??",1
I have been a broadband and mobile phone customer for 4 years. Received email clearly showing offer you might like and all information of Broadband upgrade to Vodafone ProII. I clicked the link and followed the instructions. Later I received the confirmation email which surprised me as it's just a renewal of my original Fiber 2 plan at a higher price and discount. I think that email and that way of promotion lacked the transparency and honesty. You don't mislead your customers this way and it would be better to send clear information saying the renewal of your same plan is that. I spoke with the customers service and the acknowledge it but can't do much. They advised to go to the store they might help ?!,1
"Seven+ years with Vodafone and I think I need to move providers ...........I've reached out to fix an issue with logging into MyVodafone app 5 times and not one agent has the technical knowledge to help.Once you [eventually] reach a human they log a ticket with their own backroom staff to reset account which is meant to happen in 2/3 business days but is just lost. No follow up on their behalf. They pass the buck of responsibility from team to team and your left in queues whilst they decide who's responsibility it is to fix the issue.TOBi is the most frustrating and glitchy chatbot everService is getting very expensive again too, annual CPI increases have me looking to giffgaff and lebara for exact same services",1
"Chris the manager was brilliant couldnt fault him at all. However, he was let down by the horrific computer software. For a simple upgrade it took nearly 3 hours. 3 hours i wont be getting back. 3 hours sat in a shop on god awful chairs and no toilets. Couldnt leave or else i would have lost where we were upto. Good staff typically let down by higher management.",1
"Checked before I came to Fort William for signal which said good outdoors, utter rubbish as I haven't had a signal since we arrived. I'm having to use the wife's hot spot on EE . Worst thing I have ever done is to join Vodafone again, so behind the curve with speed and signal. Stay well clear as even at home in the North East it's only average. Home broadband is C#&p as well.",1
"Vodafone customer for 30 years, went to Halifax store today to upgrade / renew.Eventually found a phone / data combo but I have a separate Vodafone data plan they couldn’t cancel in store so I needed to call 191.I now understand why the store wanted me to do this later, but not wanting to sign a new package until I knew the redundant one was definitely cancelled I called 191 while in store.The 191 handler then offered to beat the in-store deal I was offered by 10%, ~£100. As the store didn’t actually have the phone in stock it made no sense not to take up his offer to get the same thing at the same time but for less.I was then asked to leave the Vodafone store… leaving me and my 10 year old son in the cold outside the Vodafone store to have a 15 minute call with the Vodafone call centre to complete my new three year commitment to Vodafone.Is it just me that sees something wrong in the overall Vodafone model there??Also worth noting that during the call the handler believed the shop logged in and cancelled my order on the system while he was completing it, putting us back to square one again and wasting another 5 minutes - but I have no way of knowing if that’s true. If it is it crossed a spiteful line though.I can sort of understand the shop not being happy… but Vodafone’s pricing and distribution model isn’t my fault.I’ll likely be very happy with the phone, I’m ok with the plan charges and my son has a great story to tell at primary school about being kicked out of the store…. The guy on 191 was great too as an individual, but none of this saga is a ringing endorsement for Vodafone overall.",1
"I switched provider after 1 year with Vodafone because they just don't offer good value for money. There are a lot better deals for somebody like me who is just not a heavy data user. Their network was reliable and coverage was always good.However, when trying to renew my deal, the staff at various shops in London just showed very little interest in offering anything competitive, and weren't particularly helpful even though I was an existing customer.",1
"Bought a Vodafone Curve for the dog, it is pretty poor.  If it cannot find a GPS signal it reverts to a random location miles away which looks like someone else's tracker.  The app logs you out and you need to go through getting an SMS, AND an email, THEN ALSO putting in your password, to log back in.  I also cannot get it to show a map history, which is what I bought it for.  Overall it is not very well designed and not recommended.",1
Following a recent 14 day visit to US I found that I had incurred a daily charge for usage when in fact I only made a network call on one day. I queried this with the Taunton branch and it was explained that I needed to be in airplane mode otherwise my phone connecting to a mast would incur a charge?? They advised speaking to Vodafone direct which I did and they said that I should have set my phone to zero charges not airplane mode?? Neither piece of advice appears anywhere on their website as far as I could find. Vodafone are now investigating to verify what I have explained and will therefore I hope refund the amounts charged.,1
Fiber internet is excellent but. Customer service & online access to your account is demand of generation. Their customer service & mobile App is just a glitch. They call it security feature but now a day bank apps work with 1 click then why not vodafone app.,1
"The employees, Maria and Hula, were very kind and helpful. They answered our questions and we successfully managed to get the plan and phone we wanted.However, the service in general was very slow. They said it’s because of the computers loading slowly. If that can be addressed on a company level, that would be great. The whole process took 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete, which is way too long.It would objectively take less time to get a mortgage on a house.",1
Broadband seems to be ok been online with Vodafone since December last year very few outages BUT the Vodafone router is absolutely rubbish we had to buy an extender to reach all our house our previous Talktalk router was fine.Edit 17/4/23 No point in me reaching out as you put it you won't do anything about it I have tried all I was told I would have to upgrade which I don't have the money to do,1
"Initially, this ""WiFi"" enabled system was ribbish, sold as 100 mbps with a guaranteed 50 but struggled to exceed mid 30s at the router and much less throughout the house, excused by ""we dont guarantee WiFi speed"". Constant readings sent to senior CS forwarded to the tech dept resulted, although it took 14 days, a techie working with me to test  everything piece by piece. The results of reseting the router took some hours to work but we then had the speeds expected of this sytsem. SO - dont wright off the system as I did until you've hounded senior CS into getting a techie on the job. Had I settled for the first line of CS / support getting this sorted would not have happened.",1
"I would give them 5 stars if they offered free roaming within Europe. Their competitors offer free roaming with pay as you go bundles purchased, but not Vodafone. I was with them for few years because of great coverage and services, and sadly I decided to leave, after they had stopped offering free roaming. What a shame. They are the best choice if you do not need roaming.",1
The chat online and telephone calls are always a myth. Keep getting transferred to different colleagues as not one person can deal with all queries meaning I am spending hours on each time they put me on hold.,1
"Even out of contract it'll force you to pay for the full final month of connection.""Your 30 day disconnection notice will start from today, 14/08/2023.The number you are disconnecting is xxxYou have a fee of £0.00 to pay left which will come out on your normal billing date in the next 30 days.Your disconnection will be completed 30 days from today, 13/09/2023. Because of this, you will still have to pay for the final month. """,1
"It’s fine unless there’s an issue. They took 2 extra direct debit payments in April, yet to pay them back, cheaper offers for the same deal out there as they’ve decided to cancel my discount I had on, tried charging me £50 when a deal for new customers is £35. Their chat system closes itself when you leave the page on your phone, and their phone system sounds like it’s hanging up on you when you try to get through to them. They don’t care about your loyalty. 12 years I’ve paid them to be my carrier. Bit frustrating that the best they could do was the same deal as everyone else! And there are cheaper out there!Positives is if there isn’t a problem you’re fine, never bad signal or loss of data, always updating towers.",1
"Service is great.  Slow, but great.  Speed of service has nothing to do with employees;  it’s the system they use.  My only issue is gettin an appointment.  You can’t make one on the UK Vodafone number as they don’t have the capability.  You can’t just walk in and get helped because you have to be in the system for them to do so.  The number provided for the store by Vodafone customer service is out of service.  There is no published number for this store and it’s the only one within 90 miles of me.  So, I have to make a an hour and a half round trip just to make an appointment and then do it again once again for my scheduled appointment.  It’s almost like this tech company need to to hire a tech firm to sort out their issues.",1
"I organised the contract for broadband to start on 5th July and received the router a few days before. I contacted customer support on the 5th to check whether an engineer was coming to fit a new master socket since mine doesn't have a microfilter built in. I come to find out that the order failed for some ""technical reasons"" (despite receiving order confirmation emails, the router, setting up the direct debit etc). The contract now starts next week however the activation is simply a virtual button so I struggle to see what part of that has to wait until then. :(",1
"The internet is generally okay, nothing spectacular, but there are 2 main sticking points with them.1. Increasing the price before the contract is even half way through!!2. part of their introductory offer (to help ""soften the blow"" of increased prices AND shove the offer down customers' throats) they are in partnership with Giftcloud.Giftcloud? More like Griefcloud! This company makes promises but delivers nothing but disappointment and frustration. After completing a purchase expecting a gift voucher, all I got was radio silence. Their customer service? Non-existent. It's clear they thrive on deceiving customers and couldn't care less about fulfilling their promises.Calling Giftcloud a scam is too kind; they're outright thieves. They've wasted my time, caused inconvenience, and have the audacity to ignore my attempts to contact them. I demand compensation for their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. Avoid Giftcloud like the plague if you value your sanity and hard-earned money. They're not worth the headache. - I cant believe Vodafone would even consider partnering up with them!!",1
"The service today was excellent first and foremost but the store itself was FREEZING and I was there - as many people are - for over 20 minutes which was essential as i needed my phone sorting but very difficult to manage! It seems ludicrous that the doors can't be closed in baltic weather conditions, the staff must be absolutely freezing all day.",1
"Promised:Min. guaranteed: download 250.00MbpsMin. upload: 68.00MbpsReality:download 83.2Mbpsupload 57.8MbpsWiFi: The worst I had so far. Not even next to the router the mobile phone can run anything!The Wi-Fi of my neighbour next door (I was authorized to test it) is running stronger and faster than my internet using the Ethernet Network Patch Cable.Companies promised just to get you. Then, nobody cares about the service! But if you do not pay, they cut it in a blink of an eye!",1
"Gemima was helpful and gave excellent service. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the store manager, Waqar or assistant Praise who were unhelpful and came across as arrogant",1
"Absolutely unbelievable bad service. My husband took out a new contract with a new phone over two weeks ago. They told him as a reward he would get a payment of £150. He had to go back to collect his phone four days later. Trip one contract, trip two collect phone. Trip three to follow up on reward payment told we needed the receipt. Trip four to take receipt in,  only to be told it will be another 45 days before this is available. We have both had contracts with Vodafone for 5 years. Renewed the first one and about to renew the second one. Its costing more than the reward in travel and inconvenience and now we still have to wait. Would you like for us to pay in 45 days. I bet ""no"".",1
The broadband speed has not improved so far despite being a customer for 8 years… But the prices are steadily going up every year! The company has not invested to improve the broadband!,1
"Although my contract is with Vodafone,  I’ve posted this review for them (3 stars) and 2 stars for City Fibre.During the 13 months as a customer of City Fibre with Vodafone providing the broadband, there have been 2 periods of total loss of service (outages). Recent outage for 4 full days; previously 2 days.Regarding the latter 4 days loss of service:Negatives• Having a family member dependent on broadband for homeworking has meant extra costs, travel elsewhere, and a lot of stress and frustration.• 4 days to fix the problem seems excessive.• Very difficult to get a direct answer regarding the exact cause of the problem – no direct communication with City Fibre permitted.  I was informed by Vodafone that the line was damaged and needed replacing. Knowing the cause [of the damage] is important in assessing if this might be a recurring event.• Vodafone has limitations on Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme, i.e. no payments for the first 48 hours of loss of service.• Vodafone appear overly reliant on City Fibre with little influence regarding obtaining detailed communication, such as in this situation.• City Fibre’s website claims of a reliable and consistent service, is debatable. It is a subjective experience, and mine has been mixed; it has been made worse by no clear explanation of the cause of the disruption.Positives:• Vodafone did what it could in terms of communication, which was generally good and respectful, but ultimately they were reliant on information from City Fibre.• Vodafone has signed up to Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme.• When the broadband is running, it is generally working well.It seems to me some things happen that are outside anybody’s control, as may be the case in these outages. This doesn’t help in the frustration and disruption caused to those that rely on the service. However, a quicker fix of the problem and some clearer communication would certainly have helped.",1
"Although I like Vodafone, I was VERY disappointed that it charged me a £5 late fee when I had no warning from them that the DDEB had been reversed. Literally had no idea. A nice email would have sufficed with a warning but nothing.",1
"Vodafone, great deals but terrible service on resolving an account sync issue with the app and broadband quality.I had a device plan with the Vodafone for phone and broadband. unfortunately due to no-fault of my own the app wouldn’t work with my log in details.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was salvina I have probably spelt that wrongI called multiple times but spoke to a different person every time over a 2 week period.After spending the best part of 2 hours on the phoneThey were still unable to sort out my app issues with my account.Before I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to get the issue resolved. I’m not sure if she was aware of the app issues from previous customers?The other issue was to do with the intermittent signal of the broadband cutting in and out. This was detrimental to my working day at home. It would cut out on Microsoft teams around 4/5 times a day! Very frustrating!The outcome from all this was that I ended up switching both phone device and broadband to EE.This wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome and overall experience would be a lie hence the move.",1
I renewed my contract over six months ago and still can't see my usage or bills. Customer Service is a waste of time and get ghosted by their engineers email address. The app is not fit for purpose either!,1
Why is it impossible to log into Vodafone. Impossible to check speed of broadband or anything else.Well. Have tried four times to login with new passwords Vodafone has just texted. NONE OF THEM WORK! Surprise SURPRISE!,1
"I considered leaving Vodafone today, after several years.  They just increased my monthly fee by 25%.  I spent an hour and a half online with their Customer support team.They offered me Fibre 2 for £25 a month. If I was a new customer I would get it for £20.63 a month. Vodafone are poor to existing customers. It really makes you want to leave.",1
"5 Star for the actual service1 star for every time I try to access the app out of hours it's offline or unavailable. I maybe use the app once a month, and every time its when I need something urgently. How can such a large company not have a clustered enviropment so it's always up.",1
"I ordered a product from Vodafone on Saturday, choosing the ""collect from store"" option, as it promised I could collect it the next day. By Sunday, it wasn’t ready, nor on Monday. I contacted live chat on Tuesday and the first agent said the order had arrived at the store on Monday at 2:58 pm, but I hadn’t received any notification. I asked if I could pick it up, only to be told I had to wait for a notification.When I questioned this, I was passed to another agent who contradicted the first, claiming the order hadn’t arrived but was ""dispatched."" They couldn’t explain why their colleague said it was there, just kept repeating that I had to wait another 48 hours! This would be Thursday when it was originally promised for Sunday. They’ve taken my money, and no one can give a straight answer as to why it wasn't ready on time, or when it will be. All I get is ""wait 48 hours."" I needed it urgently, and the only reason I chose Vodafone was because they promised next-day collection. Absolutely awful service!Checking on the website for a fresh order (exactly the same phone) it says collect today. So if a fresh order for the same phone can be collected today then why can't I collect my order that I placed pm Saturday, now?Update: While the online support was terrible and gave me the runaround, I went into the store, and the staff were excellent. They sorted everything out quickly and efficiently. If only the online service was as good as the in-store experience!",1
"I upgraded to full fibre a couple of months ago, it was a great mistake!! The connection is unreliable, my signal is constantly dropping of. The very reason to upgrade was to have a strong connection while I work from home. My meetings constantly cut out, the signal strength cannot take a simple Teams screen sharing. There is also no way of getting support: i am directed back to signal check test by all sorts of bot chats where i am told that everything is fine with my service. Then when i go through the suggested steps proving that the problem is still outstanding the chat button conveniently does not work. There is no email address and the phone line is so busy that i cannot wait out while i also try working (on 4G!! as I have no reliable home broadband). I am locked in a 24 months contract from which I desperately want to get out of.EDIT: I managed to speak with CS, and they were very helpful so I am changing my rating. Only to 3 because I don't know yet if my drop outs will persist.",1

"New broadband connection installed by cityfibre (glasgow) on behalf of vodaphone, on 1st March 2024. It took 4 days to activate my account, and did not work for further 10 days. After 2 further fault finding visits by city fibre engineers to identify & fix the problem - it was faulty cable coming into the house - there are not many things that can go wrong so is it really difficult to identify and fix a fault ?. I also had at least 3 calls from vodaphone offshore rebooting my router and connection box in the house. I was told by vodaphone, the delayed activation and loss of service, I would automatically receive compensation, which i did not.I chased 2 months later and having got through to vodaphone support in India who were clueless and then to vodaphone in Egypt, I got someone to raise  tickets for delayed activation (4 days) and loss of service (10 days). I received the compensation for the delayed activation but not the delayed service , £70+ is still outstanding. To be fair, all working fine since it was fixed.",1
"I should probably do 2 reviews for this.  Vodafone would score 1 star but Harvey, the assistant manager in Winchester would score 5 stars.I have had a billing problem with Vodafone and despite hours trying to speak to 191 - when I eventually get through, they either can't help and just cut me off or promise to cal back and don't - I got absolutely nowhere.  I went into Vodafone in Winchester where the manager Alexei tried to help.  He discovered problems with the set up of my account going back years, spoke to Vodafone who again promised to get back within a week.  They didn't and next thing I'm receiving threatening messages saying my line will be disconnected and my number removed.I again went into Winchester Vodafone and was lucky enough to be seen by Harvey.  The first person who sat there calmly saying I will sort this for you.  Not only is he a whizz on the system, keeping on and on at it trying to find a solution, but is utterly charming with it.Harvey is now on the case checking everything is sorted and has promised to phone back with an update.  Vodafone - do everything you can to keep Harvey.  If it wasn't for him I would now be transferring our 5 numbers with you after being with you for over 25 years.  Thank you Harvey!",1
My device plan hasn’t been paid because Vodafone havnt been taking any payments they kept telling me it’s because of my bank and my bank told me it’s Vodafone that keeps rejecting it. I have been trying to get this sorted since September and they wouldn’t help me and now they have given me to the debt collectors agency. I talked to Adele today and she wasn’t really helping either only said either I pay full amount or wait for the debt collectors to contact me. All I want is to set up a direct debit but they won’t allow it which just doesn’t make sense. I even offered to pay more than I’m meant to today and they wouldn’t let me. Before also someone was meant to contact me and they didn’t and when I talked to debt collectors they told me that the account is with Vodafone. It’s a big mess! Vodafone do not know what they are saying and I am really leaning to switch providers after this bill is paid because Vodafone are not helpful and I keep having problems with them . I have been a customers for over 10 years and they won’t even try helping me.,1
Voicemail gets locked you if you enter wrong pin one time. I've only tried from abroad so may work differently from UK. You then need to call a number where nobody's picking up the phone. So it's impossible to get access to voicemail...,1
"Update on my experience on 11th September.I was so disappointed in the lack of interest in my not receiving calls/no network inside my house, I called again to make a complaint.  I was put through to a gentleman called Abdul.  He listened, spoke with a manager and asked that I hold on while tests were being run.  He said if the call was terminated, he would call back.  It was, and he did.  He asked me to turn off my internet and try to make calls from different areas in my house and he would call back in 1 hour to see how I got on.  I cannot believe it worked.  Every room I made a call to my landline and I had no problems.  I started again, this time with my internet on, and after a little blip in one area of the house, the rest worked.  Abdul called back and advised he would call again on the 12th to check everything was still ok.  Really pleased it worked, so if anyone has a problem, maybe just go straight to complaints.  Everything is still ok, but he never called back on 12th.  If he had it would have been a 5 star review.",1
they have not bad phone sigal none in my village of corcce they have good vale contracts for my existing pone talk mobile but you have to ask for th cheaper other wise they just say £15 is the ceepeast when you go i instore  when they relly do one for £7,1
"Great, Vodafone is starting to turn off their 3g signal. What chance do most people have as their 4&5g is garbageMay as well go back to 2 tin cans and a piece of string if you are stuck on this network. Worst decision I ever made to come to this 3rd world company.Broadband is poor as well.I appreciate I get unlimited data but the speed is dire, most of the time it takes 30 second's to load a news page.Used to be on EE which was great and never had any issues, with Vodafone there is 4 dead spots on my way home from work along the A19 which sometimes causes me to reboot my phone to reconnect to 5hr network. to be honest it may also be partially due to the dire Pixel 6 phone as well. Either way I'm trying to get out of both contracts asap.",1
I bought a phone from Vodafone shop in Doncaster a week ago and paid £49 for the phone but I was walking out and on the stand it was priced at £39 does Vodafone no it's against the consumer rights law to over charges I would go back to the shop but the manager doesn't have any powers to refund I would send a letter but they never respond I sent a letter to the CEO 2 weeks ago about something else I'm still waiting for a response so I will just do a charge back to my card so please contact me Vodafone and it was missing the ear plugs for the phone and the charger you can message me here I have also texted your retail operation's manager Rebecca hessey on her mobile number,1
"I had ordered a mobile hotspot over the phone - took three hours and two days to get it all confirmed. My order tracker said I'd receive it the next day but I didn't and the day after, it said my order has been cancelled (!?) no alerts - i went to check my tracking updates! COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED BY DPD - POOR SERVICE FOR SURE AND THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO CONTACT THEM AT ALL!I called back Vodafone and the person told me they can't tell me why it was cancelled but said it happened at 4am ?!? I asked for a click and collect instead of delivery and they said they couldn't do that for me and asked me to replace my order and wait for 3 more days.I lost hope but I called back an hour later and got to speak with Sharu, who went through all my details with me calmly and was very empathetic all throughout the call. He was able to look into click and collect for me and had me stay on the phone for about 15 mins and got my order placed and my device ready for collection.",1
Very poor signal for calls and data in pevensey bay for me inside and out. I have spoken to their people many times and been advised to to the same things to try and rectify over and over again. I now manage to make calls over WiFi(indoors) but struggle to get two bars. I even boight a second phone to check mine was ok and had the same issue. Would not recommend them in this area. Also you would think they would keep a record of previous calls and advice so you don't have to go over the same ground every single time. Also I Don not have any media accounts so cannot conduct responses that way. PS I used my phone in London over weekend and it worked fine.,1
I was with vodafone for years.Most of the network providers monthly contract included free EU roaming. But vodafone charged £2.25 a day on top of monthly charges.Also price increases twice within a year.,1
"I’ve had a Vodafone contract for well over 10 years, probably close to 15 years. For the vast majority of time it’s been as any network should be in terms of network coverage. At any contract upgrade time I’ve always felt somewhat valued and had some discounts added for a new phone or if going on to a sim only plan temporarily I found it was a good deal. However this time I was offered a really poor sim only deal, no offers of discounts and no movement in price. I told the lady on the phone that I can see deals half the price online on Vodafone networks, why can’t you do the same? The answer was it was a 3rd party contract, now if I can get a better deal by going to a 3rd party why an earth would I want to go direct to Vodafone. Absolutely ridiculous! Since that last conversation and have my PAC code sent I have had no contact from customer retentions which means my 10-15 years of business had no value or the Vodafone don’t care about existing customers and are happy for them to leave. So after many, many years of using Vodafone I have switched to 3 network. I gave 3 stars as the network coverage is decent, customer services is usually good to deal with but this last interaction was enough for me to give 1 star but felt that it wouldn’t be a clear picture of the last 10+ years.",1
I spoke today with jay from customer office ! I lost a lot of time explaining what I want but the idi run away and not come back. I dont understand why Vodafone paying idio like him ! I just need a new contract. Just to give money to Vodafone !,1
"Signed up for fibre broadband and it wan't made clear how much disruption/ ugly wiring and ugly boxes would be involved outside and inside the house- plus I need to get a extra socket sited ( at my expense) so router and fibre box can both be plugged in.They have to be next to each other unless the householder organises and installs their own longer ethernet cable between the two.   None of this was explained by Vodaphone. City Fibre who did the installation were informative and helpful but pressure was applied by comments like "" copper lines are being phased out so it will have to be done at some time"". Ultimately I now have an unsightly brown box on the outside of the house  and an ugly set up on the wall inside with a large  freestanding white router in a situation that is not what I wanted but the alternative was running cables along the hall round 2 doors, across the stairs,through a doorway, along a wall, and round another door. I will also need to plug the landline phone into the new router which is not where I want my phone. Plus have just realised phone has a plug as it has an answer machine is I can't actually use it any more Didn't think of that one and no one explained it in advance. Very dissatisfied with outcome of switching to full fibre.PS trying to get through on phone is a nightmare- clearly set up to prevent every obstacle to speaking to a human being, including demanding aPIN which I have not been given",1
"Had rollercoaster rides when 7 days remaining in contract to finish. Wanted to retain the spending in control. Offer was to downgrade the package. Agreed and someone made it happen. Then it was cancelled and i was out of old contract by the time. Everytime i talk to them they pit new order and it remain open ... never activated and one brilliant advisor has just sorted it and my activation of new plan is now planned after x'mas.I have got nothing but anxiety and worry for piling up current bills and future bill was going to be double than what it could be. Also they have added unusual charge of ""purchase fees"" worth £16  in my next bill. Which was never been mentioned by any one, even though i mention to advisors. Billing related complaint has been raised but they never gave me answer about that fees and some explanation of future bill can be only found when it is generated.So i have no choice to wait till then and raise it again if not removed from bill. Average time of call with them was never been less than 90 minutes which do not uphold Vodafone reputation i have been praising for.Hope as promised new contract takes place. Like other providers are having multiple stars from trustpilot, Vodafone should do all for their loyal customers. I felt like i was and i am badly letdown by Vodafone till now.",1

I have just jumped ship with my mobile phone package to Vodafone from O2 after too many years to mention the mobile service is fantastic I sometimes even get 5G whereas I was lucky to even get 4G with O2.Now for the BUT I swapped over from BT WiFi and phone on the 17th  I’ve now been in the garden a few times and where I picked up broadband with BT in the garden? The signal had dropped out completely on Vodafone’s new 6E router. We also tried it within the property to find the broadband drops out in the bedroom furthest away. We had signal throughout the property and the hub is in exactly the same place as the BT 6 hub was. I called Vodafone on Tuesday and spoke with a lovely lady who was going to send out one booster to begin with too see how we got on with just one. She had to put us on hold but came back and said our router was the new 6E and the booster she was going to get sent out would not be compatible. But she said that the broadband guys said I would have to upgrade my package. I can’t understand why a more advanced router needs a booster in comparison to the BT router and also I cannot understand that one minute they was going to send out a booster then the next NO I would have to pay more a month or still had time to return to BT. Being unable to walk and in a wheelchair and on Oxygen since contracting COVID I cannot go through having to rely on people to set up everything for me I find that embarrassing.,1
"Would you think buying an inexpensive pay-as-you-go phone would take 10 hours!?  I certainly didn’t think so, until I had to interact with Vodaphone.First, I stopped by the store looking to purchase a certain phone SEVEN times.  Each time, the phone was out of stock.  Each time, I got different information about what the procedure was and what information I would need.  What the sales people I saw FORGOT to mention was that I could just go online and get one!  They incorrectly said activation could only be done in store.  Instead, they kept on telling me to come back in the next day, and the next, and the next.  I came back, waited in line, left, came back, repeat.  Seven times.  On visit seven, one man finally told me I could just buy the phone online.  By that time, I needed the phone the next morning.  (I had spent over a week at this already).  Then, they gave me the wrong information about the online purchase options.  I ended up speaking with someone via chat, and indeed, the purchase options I had been asking about were not possible online given my now urgent timeline.  So, back to the store, for a 30 minute wait at 10am all for a £30 back up phone!  What an unpleasant experience.",1
"The Openreach engineer arrived & got the fiber optic broadband line working, but no Internet. He said he suspected the router wasn't compatible & told me they won't return unless Vodafone issue a new one. I call Vodafone (great this non-joined-up service) and am refused a new router. Call center guy in India tries to ridicule the Openreach guy's findings, before moving on to patronise me and my 'confusion' with the tech (I hold advanced degrees & a Doctorate in Computer Science). Finally, told activation can take up 'til midnight to happen. Midnight arrives, sails by, nothing is activated. My landline phone doesn't work anymore either. The Openreach guy suspects the Vodafone router, but at this point I'm pretty sure it's Vodafone themselves who haven't got off their backsides to activate it. So much stress. They didn't even send the cable they were supposed to send to connect the Openreach box to my router (I had to buy one from a neighbour). Nor did they send the adaptor for my landline, so I'm cut off.I call Vodafone again the next day and speak to 'Marion', who is surely Vodafone's Star helpline person! She activated the line during our (long) call. She was helpful, knowledgeable, easy to talk to and a pleasure of a human being to deal with. She got everything working. Then she put in an order for the missing phone adaptor. Just perfect.It's 5 stars for Marion but 1 star for the company, so I'm averaging it out to 3 stars, because of the stress and because it was left up to me to chase this up with multiple long phone calls, rather than receiving a ready and working service, or I'd still be cut off now.",1
"I signed up for 24 months contract. The price went up every April.What's the point securing a contract?Started with £16.00 contract just under 2 years ago and now paying £22.60, not fair !",1
"Vodafone currently supply our home broadband - I believe many of the issues with broadband stem from BT OpenReach one way or another, but Vodafone is a big enough company in it's own right to take some responsibility/not be bullied too much.Set up was a bit of a shambles - told the line needed installing even though the new-build house already had an active fibre connection with lights on(!) Waited an extra month or so just for a guy from OpenReach to come in and say 'yup that's fine' and leave.Connection is ok, has been a little flaky sometimes but generally fine for daily work and evening media streaming. On the occasion it drops though, router can take a very long time to regain a lost connection. Router is mediocre and app control is terrible... if you ever manage to set it up to your phone it chucks you out permanently at some point, and to reconnect the app you need to reset the router completely (even that didn't always work). Gave up on it.Again - OpenReach and many customer-facing telecom suppliers are doing it, but mid-contract, (over) inflationary rises in price is a dodgy practice in my eyes, however many companies there are that do it. If I sign up to a £30, 24 month contract I should be paying £30 in month 23, not ~£40. Else don't call it a contract - let customers leave whenever you change the terms (price).In all, absolutely no reason to stay at end of contract so will look to ditch and switch - as many services force you to nowadays - unless you want to sit paying more than you need to for being loyal/'lazy'.",1
"Popped in to Vodafone MerryHill to get some information on switching networks. Gup was brilliant and helped me choose the best contract for me, and options to transfer the family. Transfer happened today with no issues and already enjoying better coverage.Heading back soon to transfer the rest of my contracts now as it was so easy.Thanks Gup and the Vodafone Team.Updated 23rd April 2024Further to my initial positive review, I have had some issues with the transfer of the other numbers. Firstly, Vodafone have a restriction on all new customers to 2 connections to the contract. I have been advise by the credit team this is standard and you need three complete months billed so my initial discussion to move over 4 contracts would never have gone through. Which brings me on to the second issue, all of this is done by the credit team and rather than simply advising on the restriction, all communication’s suggest it’s a credit issue….. This stressed me out massively for 48 hours thinking there was something wrong with my credit score (which there wasn’t) until I finally got an answer, but this was only on the back of a “credit appeal” where the Vodafone rep advise on the 2 line limit…Vodafone really need to firstly advise on the 2 line limit, and then secondly be clear that it’s not a credit issue. For reference my credit score was 930 out of 1000 so the 2 line limit (sim only too) was clearly not related to my score….Be mindful if you have multiple contracts you are looking to switch…..",1
All the installation is done by Openreach and yet they have no control on them as a sub-contractor.My istallation was planned for 11th April. The date was set 1 month before.Openreach engineer said the line is not live! Then the drama began. They said it may takes up to 5 working days! Today is 17th. 6 days after the contract date and I am still getting same auto-generated text in online chat.Not a good experinced so far... They promise me tomorrow the line will be activated.Next update will be posted Tomorrow . Either a 1 start or a 3 depend on Openreach!!I sould kept my ISP.**** UPDATE on 18 th APR ************On 18th April they keep delaying So 2* has changed to 1*.They are now saying they CAN NOT Compence me at all.Thank you!!1* Company.1* Online chat service.********************Do not read the folllwing response. its just useless.Update on 25th April.... Still waiting .... Seriously ??-------Update on 27th April.Finally they managed to send Openreach engineer to fix it.Now I have internet and I give them 3 Starts because the Complaint took serousley and followed up.The internet speed is good. worth the money.++++++++++FIN,1
"I've been with voda for many years . Over that time I've varied my plan according to business and social needs and its worked well. Staff you contact are usually very helpful and their customer service system works well. Travelling the world their data and telephony connections were usually reliable and high quality.However when it comes to the hard core subject of cash they let themselves down very badly in several areas .Firstly they were very fast to remove automatic covered  roaming post brexit but even before that they were clamping down and becoming inflexible. They introduced a system whereby if you were out of the uk got a certain time your  roaming cost you extra even on an inclusive plan. It was a complicated calculation that they got wrong and started charging me a month early and would not back down for quite some time and did so just before the regulator was about to step in.We then move onto in plan price rises . Fair enough up the cost by the RPI , though it is a bit of a money gtab, but then to add a further 3 point something percent on for ""network investment"" ?? Surely ongoing investment is par to operating and development strategy and accommodated within the overall business plan ?Someone somewhere is being greedy and then shoots themselves in the foot by posting massive profits .To put all of that in context I have an EU plan too . Unlimited texts and sms . 8gb of data ( chosen by me) with EU and UK roaming . All for €9.99 with excellent service. Voda can't or won't  come anywhere near that.Update : whilst voda prices are on the up again my provider has put me on unlimited everything for the equivalent of Uk £10, still with roamimg. Voda are poor value.Goodbye voda.",1
"Vodafone are looking like they are doing all they can to counter what is presently taking place on the ground in the personal telecoms and media industry to all of their customers.I say this from the position of being a victim to the Three iPhone scam and I now realize that once they have scammed you that's when you look for somewhere to run to in my case it's Vodafone.No matter what the companies using the existing infrastructure try to do the engineers are wagging the dog now.When they come to switch you up you expect them to leave you with the same switches and cable as you always had but that's not what happens as far as I can tell they change your switch to a single slower Openreach Master Socket 5C not 5gz, face plate and there is no filter in the Vodafone Router box it's been removed in transit.So now I want to know where are my extra pairs now that I'm reduced to a single socket switch and one of my three pairs in the cable, with no filter, I'm setup without my knowledge or permission for sharing something I suggest you never doI'm paying extra for the privacy and the speed and to my way of thinking I'm getting neither the entire set up is to reduce speed to 3gz not 4 or 5gz.I want my speed back or come and remove your switches and replace my dual Openreach switch that was originally there.Who is personally monitoring our network and slowing us down.More to the point, why are we being monitored and by whom.Paranoid, you better be, if you're not a little skeptical in the UK these days then you're in a far worse position than I.",1
The guy that sold me the sim Arjun was not very good with his customer interface. Did not explain anything and did not talk. We have been with you guys for a very long time and have to say I felt like I was in the way?,1

"**Customer Review:**I have been a witness to a very unruly and rude gentleman by name David George who is wasting everyone’s time and picking on the staff unnecessary and exhibits rude behavior and creates disturbances, demonstrating a lack of interest in Vodafone's services. This individual has a pattern of targeting staff members, leading to an uncomfortable and disruptive environment. Such customers should be blacklisted and never allowed to step in the store.",1
Where to start. Communication is absolutely terrible whenever I've faced any issues.My latest one being that I called and asked if the contract could be put in my own name (it's in my ex husbands but it's my phone/internet service) He is using it as a form of control and manipulation and I told them that. I begged them to swap it over and they told me they can't help me.I then asked if it could go into my mums name who is already a Vodafone customer. Bizarrely they said this was fine. I had to call my mum and tell her to call them and do the same with my ex. I had to act as this go between multiple times. It took 3 days of calls to finally get to a place where they said it would be done then we heard nothing.I called them after 3 days to be told the information had been lost and we'd have to go through it all again. My ex then refused.I had to flee my ex for domestic violence so for him to have this last piece of control over me is awful. Every time we have a row he says he'll cut my phone/Internet off.Yet Vodafone won't help me. I'm trapped until Aug next year.I certainly won't be going with this company again once the contract ends.,1
"Review for broadband set up. Switched from BT, only because of cost. Set up was great and can’t fault CityFibre at all, respectful, quick, clean installation and the supply is all good, I have no disappointment with regards to any of this. However when taking out the contract online I was informed that I do not need to do anything with regards to cancellation of my current provider, BT, and that Vodafone will inform them directly. After all was set up I contacted BT to inform them I would be cancelling my DD payments and was told they they were not informed. After a lengthy call to Vodafone I now have to take myself to one of their shop once I have proof of last payment to BT and the email showing where it says I didn’t need to do anything (this of course being an automatically generated email and likely to be what they send out all the time) and once showing them this they will refund me what I have paid to BT due to Vodafone not cancelling on my behalf. Being self employed and working six days a week I probably won’t have time to do this so I’m very disappointed by this situation. Such a shame for a simple task that I was informed they would do, which I could have as easily done had they just said to call BT and cancel I’m now going to be out of pocket….. A very disappointing start ☹️☹️☹️",1
"Had to wait quite a while to be seen (not staffs fault just busy and three staff on)When serverd Tom was very good,pleasent and got me a good deal.I wanted to cancel my tablet I no longer use but had to do it online would of been better to be able to do it in the shop. Again not the fault of the staff in the shop.",1
"My third time on here about this company. I tried to communicate with the Social Media Team through my partners FB Messenger account about my previously reviewed dismal experience. After numerous to and fros was I informed that (a) because I'm not on my own FB/Twitter and (b) I don't have a Vodafone sim card (I was supposed to get one for the back up dongle with both the first and second router they sent but never did), nor a Vodafone mobile number, they couldn't verify my account. Then I got this via Trustpilot:Hi Howard,After reading your previous review, I can understand your frustration. It's not good to hear the experience you're having.We do need to take your account details securely, so that we can then help further.Please get in touch with our WiFi Xperts on 08080 034 515. We've also a really useful help center that will help to run live tests on your line here: (link not permitted in reviews)Thanks,Vodafone Social Media TeamI didn't have that number so called and luckily a Customer Service agent named Huda (I asked her to spell it) dealt with the whole thing in about 40 minutes. Apparently the original agent was wrong and I can revert to my original package at the original price. It will take up to 24 hours and all will be sorted.The 3 Stars are for the efforts of Huda, a very friendly, polite and sympathetic lady who gave the impression she really wanted to help. I just hope she's supported by the upgrade team (she said they're sorting it out).So the blood pressure medication will stay in the cupboard for the time being. Although I still have no sim in my backup dongle.Watch this space !",1

"Called Vodaphone Customer Service this afternoon, to give 30 days notice of my wish to cancel my Home Broadband Account (moving home and will need to utilise another provider).  Customer Service could not action my request as they are undergoing ""technical"" updates, so none of their systems are working apparently!  Have been instructed to phone back in 7 days, where upon my 30 day notice will start (so I am paying for an extra 1 weeks service that I do not want)  This cannot be fair???  Welcome Vodaphone's response to this :-                                                           Visited a branch (Northallerton) to sort and the team where great, pointing me in the right direction and finally managed to speak to a human in the Retentions team today, who was really efficient and has sorted out my issue:- Thank You.

"Unfortunately I have to knock two stars off .I entered the shop to ask information about sim packets, while my son was checking the new iphone. The information given was very  useful and detailed.When I was about to go my minor mentioned me he took photos of himself, and was trying to erase them. Unfortunately it was not possible as the delete button on the iphone's screen was covered by the metallic frame that holds the phone in place. We tried to push it nevertheless but we weren't that successful. I politely asked a member of staff to help saying that my son took photos, could we please erase them. He tried to push  the delete button also unsuccessfully, due to the metallic frame blocking access. What I found very annoying is that instead of him removing the metallic frame and deleting the photos, he said to me in an apathetic way (at least in my understanding)  that I myself have  to push the delete button eitherway to delete the photos. This is of course understandable, but what about the metallic frame blocking the access to the delete button?? In conclusion we managed to delete the photos by squeezing our fingers in between the phone's screen and the protective metallic frame that holds the phone. Of course mostly my son as he had smaller fingers, and yes it was painful.I understand that I should probably supervise my son more, but such reaction I didn't expect. It makes me feel concerned about how the specific shop or the specific member of staff deals with GDPR issued such as this.So if you visit the specific shop and try the phones' front camera making selfie, make sure that you are ok to leave your photo stored in that device, cause it will be unlikely for you to delete it, at least without hurting yourselves...",1
"When I ordered the board band service I requested that the old phone number to be ported. It is vital in my case as my wife suffers from poor health. The phone line was the contact between us and doctors,Hospitals and elderly relatives. I ordered nearly two months in advance giving them ample time to set up as l required. The first time I was aware there was no connection was when a relative tried to contact us. I range customer services who stated it would take up to a10 working days. I told them that this was not acceptable for reasons stated. After 4 days  I rang and asked if calls could be redirected until the switch over was complete. The operator tried to help but could not achieve the results needed. I told the operator I was not happy and asked to speak to his manager. The manager could not even give me the time of day. Not impressed with the level of customer services. I'm beginning to think that I made a mistake in my choice. It brings into question why am I paying for a land line that is useless!!Yesterday 1th I spent what I can only call a merry-go - round for 1 hour Trying to resolve this situation. I was told the number would be ported by 3 pm today. 3pm came and went. Having spoken to 2 operators today,  the earliest they could port was the 21st. The operator  on the last call would have been better using two cans and a length of string. The line kept breaking up so could  ot understand what he was saying. I had to request him to sms the details. For a phone company I find that difficult to get my head round. I did manage to get his number in the sms.  I will be talking to them again, is the way I see it at the moment. PROVE ME WRONG !!!As of today the 22nd the line still has not been ported.it should have been competed  yesterday. We were not told on installation that we had a new number and didn't find out that until the 6th October. I reported to customer services. I was given assurances, promises and told that it would be put right ASAP.  THE COMPANY POLICY SÈEMS TO BE FOB THEM OFF  MAKE PROMISES GIVE ASSURANCES. THE WILL GEY FED UP AND GO AWAY. I informed them that I was not satisfied with their services and told them that I wouldBe sending a letter to Margherita Della Valle in due course. Again I'm still paying for a landline with a number nobody like doctors know.",1
"The broadband service itself is good, we've had two years of reliable internet, the 4G backup does fail quite frequently but fortunately never at the same time as the broadband so we don't end up disconnected. My bug bear has come at renewal time, I was given my upgrade options which were reasonable but I found a better deal elsewhere. When I tried to cancel I was told I could only do so through an online chat or phone.When I spoke to someone on the chat, in spite of providing my account number and personal information as asked, I was asked a further security question (a pin number) which I advised I had never set up so couldn't provide but would happily answer other security questions. After answering several (correctly) I was told I couldn't be spoken to further because I had failed security and I would need to go into store with two forms of ID.I went into store, waited 20 minutes to be spoken to, to be told they can't cancel my contract in store, I would need to phone their customer service from the store so the store assistant could verify my identity which he didn't do before starting to call them. He then asked if I was leaving to go to another provider and advised, I didn't need to cancel at all, the new provider would sort it out so don't waste my time calling.As it is, by the time I'd got this all sorted out, I'd missed the deal from another company so I've ended up upgrading and staying put but what made me laugh is that to upgrade, absolutely no security required whatsoever because I can do it through my account.I fully appreciate this is convenient for customers but it frustrates me that essentially, they are happy to take more money from me without any verification of my identity but when it comes to me stopping payments, no amount of convenience is offered.That's not the sort of customer service that leaves you feeling good about giving them your money.",1
"Honest review, I had a very hard time figuring out how to cancel my broadband subscription. When I called the number the automated message referred me to online chat, the online chat referred me back to the number.  I wish Vodafone would make this process more easy, and straightforward.  Once I reached the right team they were very helpful and the process was very quick.",1
"I have taken out a device plan with the Vodafone unfortunately due to no-fault of my own my phone is now faulty. I’ve taken it to the Apple Store but as it’s not under warranty with Apple, they quoted me a price to fix it which I was not prepared to payI have only had the phone for about 4 to 6 weeks before the fault occurred. The phone is in pristine condition. There is no water damage. There is no cracks or scuffs on the device.I tried to speak to Customer Service chat but it was not very helpful. It passed me through to an online agent who kept repeating what I was saying back to them and they were insinuating that I was an active in the chat and they threatened to close the chat multiple times , I would have the chat open in the background. I did not leave the webpage. I didn’t close the webpage. I have always had the best interactions with my local Vodafone store, so I prefer to handle things online or over the phoneThe agent I spoke to told me her name was slavina I have probably spelt that wrongI called At 8:12 am on the 7th of October 2024In regards to my faulty phone and I did my displeasure about my service with the chat box online and a previous attempt at calling,After spending 27 minutes on the phoneThey were unable to book my phone for repair because of a system errorBefore I called and I looked online, I have seen previous people quoting similar issues when they’ve called VodafoneThe person who I spoke to on the phone was very niceSeeing other people from many years ago and recently saying that they’ve had similar issues when trying to book a repair for a faulty deviceIt does make me question the serviceI’m kind of 50-50 at the moment because I’ve never been overcharged and I like my contractThe service has room for improvement, but it’s not the worst I’ve receivedI’m going into store on my next day off to book a repair in person as I’m not confident the agent was able to book the repair for meShe seemed to lean towards encouraging me to go to the store to book it. I’m not sure if she was aware of the system error before.Why is my phone being faulty? I don’t have any complaints with Vodafone however whenever anything goes wrong, you’re going to be dissatisfied.Will update my review/post another once I return from visiting the store to see if I can get my phone booked for repairThis wasn’t the worst interaction I’ve had over the phone with a companys Customer ServiceBut to say I’m happy with the outcome would be a lie",1
We are new customer to Vodafone broadband and have basic fibre we are low user but it’s not able to connect with ring cameras properly unless we upgrade our package as low user think this is not acceptable to add extra 10 pounds a month it’s a poorer quality than our old copper network,1
"I have to start by saying that I had been with Virginmedia for 23 years and quite honestly had had enough. They constantly kept putting up their prices. I also did not like being put through to India, where not all of the people spoke good English. I looked on the internet and decided that I would go to Vodafone, also so did a friend of mine. We were being connected the same day. Her's done is 40 minutes mine over 6 weeks. Not really Vodafone fault since the internet said I had City Cable but there's the rub. Whosoever put this cable in didn't leave any markers for connection!! Well as usual all took ages for find the cable then digging a hole and putting in the connection then City Cable arriving for the box and connection. Not the nicest of workmen but perhaps I was just unlucky. The guy in the house very nice and tidy, Now all connected await 12/24 hours for the phone to be connected. Well after 24 hours no phone, back to Vodafone they explained that the number had not been called upon as it was 21 days from closing until recall. Ok so at last I had Broadband then guess what my printer was off line because everything had been closed down for days. Got that sorted and new inks and at last heaven be praised I had everything working after over 6 weeks. This is problem, three different companies working and it does not work. I do not work from home, had I been doing so it would have been a disaster. My friend is very happy she did not have the delay, why you ask? well she had a telegraph pole in her street and I did not. The moral of this story is ""if you are going to go to Vodafone make sure that you have City Cable in your street and that there is a marker."" Otherwise expect a delay. I would like to add that Vodafone have tried to help, they gave me a cash amount back and the villains really seem to be City Cable, Vodafone were slow in the telephone connection but in the end we got there, for me it was a nightmare but not the end as I do not work from home and so when you get someone to dig a hole please let them have the brains not to fill it in without leaving markers.",1
"Been with VF for 26yrs and at end of my contract they removed my 30% discount in June 22,fair enough, last week rang them for upgrade to Pixel 7 the best they could do was £200 upfront over 36mth with airtime £30pm 24mths do the sums yourself told them I had a deal at CPW with VF £180 upfront 32g at £22pm do the sums yourself. They said you won't get Veryme and support lol what a joke CPW you get the same don't fall for the same old sales blag, and I'm still with VF.",1
"Like others I have been with Vodafone for years, and have a number of contracts with them, and never missed a payment. My first moan is that a couple of my contracts were recently due for renewal, and I got the usual text/mail offering a nice new Samsung. Go through the renewal/upgrade, and get told I cannot have what I want as I have failed the Credit Check. I have no issues getting credit elsewhere, so just renewed SIM only, and purchased my phone elsewhere, and cheaper. So Vodaphone lost money there.Next thing I have a mobile broadband contract that I wish to cancel, it never gets used but costs £43.00 a month. It expired in December 22, and I still can't cancel it. Like others have said, the customer service appalling, worst I have ever come across. You speak to TOBI their automated crap bot, who is as useful as a Chocolate fire guard in a firestorm. First time I managed to get a number and spoke to a human, who then spends hours trying to convince you to stay, which I didn't want. They assured me they could convert my account to pay as you go, and I wouldn't have to keep paying, and would send a mail confirming this. Mail never arrived, and I'm still paying full whack, so total and utter BS.Today I tried TOBI again, and managed to get a live person on the live chat, immediately I start the chat I get kicked due to inactivity which was the damn wait in the queue.Went through the pain in the proverbial motions again, and... same thing happens a bit further in.Guess what Vodafone, I am going to go to my local store, and have a go there, and will create a scene if it can't be completed there. I am keeping evidence of everything I try, as if you do not sort it, I will consider legal action as you hold people to ransom.I see on other reviews on here you tell people to use Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, well guess what, I do not use such social media as I am over the age of 12!!! I have no interest in having accounts on those platforms what so ever, so how does somebody like me cancel the DAMN Contract. You used to be so good, now you are utterly useless. I will be leaving when all my contracts come up for renewal, as your customer support is the worst ever.Update: 19/03/2023Not surprisingly after the review above, which was originally 1 - Star I have managed to cancel the contract following the links supplied in the reply to my review from Vodafone. Why it couldn't have been this easy originally I can only guess it is to put people off of leaving Vodafone due to it being too difficult. However once I followed the links supplied it was easy enough to cancel the one contract I do not use, and therefore I have increased the rating to 3 - stars.",1
"Taken out a 2 year Broadband Service 500Mbs, changing over from BT 100Mbs service. Took about around half a day for the service to start but the VOIP transfer of the phone number from BT took somewhat longer. That doesn't surprise me and I wouldn't jump to conclusions the extra delay in down to Vodafone. Getting a mobile number transferred between operators  generally goes much more smoothly than transfer of landline numbers. I think it's a good deal at least for the contact period, even factoring in the ubiquitous April over inflation price increases that everyone applies.But whilst my phone number is now recognized the phone still doesn't work as they forgot to include a VOIP phone adapter in the equipment they sent me so they are having to now send through a  BS 6312 (BT) female to RJ11 male adapter separately. The order did include wired phone service  so I'm uncertain whether this omission was a mistake OR if they are just trying to penny pinch by excluding the adapter from the package. It's probably not a great idea to let people try to source their own VOIP adaptor, because there are various types with/without low pass filter and with/without ringing capacitor, and use of the wrong type could then lead to further issues.They did send superfluous adaptors for DSL which I don't need as I'm on Optical Fibre now and don't actually have a copper line any longer. In general I think they could save a bit of cost AND give a better service by matching up the equipment they send with the equipment needed for the order.The telephone  support for this problem was OK, but the link they sent via SMS for video call setup (so they could look at the connections on the back of the router) didn't work so well as the web page on the link  wouldn't let me grant permissions to use my smart phone camera whilst the ongoing phone call icon was still on screen in the foreground. So I had to drop the phone call first in order to grant permissions, and was then me on a video call for where I couldn't hear/see any one on the other end. It did the job though and I left the camera pointing at the back of the router and it became clear later that they had seen what they needed to see when they called me back (though the security questions all needed going through again). I've certainly had a lot worse support from other ISPs and was straight through to someone without waiting when I called them.The router they sent is a Technicolor THG3000. Comparable specs to the Sagecom built BT Smart Hub2 that I was using previously. Slightly more intuitive web user interface, I think. But still no 802.11ax (WiFi 6) or WPA3 security option. Would be nice to see movement from WiFi 5 as some operators are now gearing up to roll out routers with WiFi 7. I was hoping for a WiFi 6 based router, but not too surprised that I didn't get one.Update: The VoIP adapter arrived, but it still didn't have a ringing capacitor within it so everything worked apart from my phone not actually ringing when it's receiving a call. However I know the superfluous DSL filter I was sent will have a 1.0 - 1.8 uF capacitance across the 2 wire voice line side. So I connect the VOIP adapter to the router, the DSL filter to the VOIP adapter, and the phone to the voice side of the DSL filter and BINGO the phone now rings. Nothing like the diagram I was sent but it works. I have the advantage of having worked for GEC Plessey Telecoms in the past so I understood what a non ringing phone means and how to fix that. I fear that Vodafone don't understand any of it anymore because everything is outsourced in such a way that the left hand no longer knows what the right is doing and there is less and less technical expertise actually left in the company itself.",1
"To be honest I have mixed feelings with Vodafone and not entirely sure if I will stick with them, since day one having tech issues with my Motorola handset every occasion I go into the east Kilbride branch they look it over and because it works there and then they do nothing I find this poor for well over a year and a half same issues the phone freezes up or shuts down yet I'm looked at as if I'm making it up, the broadband also for few months persistent in losing signal, so I don't envisage a continuation in being a client at end of contracts have ran their course",1
"I am not outright faulting Vodafone passé but I have been having issues with my handset for over a year pretty much when I have went into the east Kilbride store the phone on five occasions did work, the one time it never they did offer to inspect yet a courtesy phone was a no shot, I don't do Web chat I have tried to contact Vodafone on two email addresses yet my email comes back as undeliverable, this is highly tedious, does anyone have a correct email address for me to get hold of them?",1
"If you are offered fibre from vodafone don`t touch it. Broadband been down a week. City fibre supposed to fix their infastructure. No contact from them as promised. No sign they are going to turn up any time soon. Vodafone have no idea what they are doing even if they say they do. Stick with the copper. Or use another provider that does not use city fibre stick with bt. Update - Broadband and home phone back up. Took 10 days and a trip to the shop. But we are back up now. Vodafone reply use social chat, not helpful when broadband down and mobile data limit with another provider running low,",1
"I've used Vodafone mobile for the last 15 years or so, never had a problem.Just switched to their broadband and my goodness what a joke.Appalling download speeds, well under their ""guaranteed minimum"", frequent disconnects across multiple devices, the inability to download updates/apps from the Google Play store on my phone - meaning using a VPN or mobile data to keep everything up to date, even YouTube struggles to load.3 stars overall due to the non-issue of my mobile, but 1 star for broadband.In hindsight I wouldn't switch if they were paying me.",1
"Wow, I see that a lot of people are not happy with the price hikes. 10.5% CPI, 3.9% towards rolling out full fibre to more homes. I'm not even a full fibre customer so I will be paying this added cost so others receive a faster service. So in total, a 14.4% increase to me mid contract.Originally when I joined Vodafone, I was paying about £19 a month for 55Mbs, with the latest increase, its closer to £26.The price of my current plan is actually closer to what people are paying for full fibre, 500Mbs symmetrical download/upload. This means less value for me.I still have over a year of my contract left with Vodafone but it actually worked out cheaper for me to cancel it anyway and pay the cancellation fee.The cancellation fee is based on money that you would have paid Vodafone minus the costs that Vodafone have to pay as a result of you, being their customer. By this, I mean, they deduct tax, deduct line rental for however many months and then recalculate the tax based on the new amount.This meant that the cancellation fee for the remaining year of contract was about £82.I then found a company called Lit that would do me full fibre, 500Mbs download, 500Mbs upload for £27 a month.Based on me still being in a contract with Vodafone, they also offered me 6 months free service to cover the cost of my cancellation fee. They have also promised me that there will not be any mid contract price hikes.This means that I now have a new 24 month contract with the first 6 months free, followed by 18 payments of exactly £27. Total for 24 months, including cancellation fee is £568.Vodafone said they had a better deal as I wouldn't have to pay the cancellation fee and I wouldn't have to pay the 14.4% this April if I took out a new contract.They offered me 500Mbs download (250Mbs guaranteed) 68Mbs upload for £30 a month. Taking into consideration that CPI will be added April 2024, I estimated that my bill would increase to £35 a month for approximately 12 months. In total, it would have costed me £780 to take another 24 month contract with Vodafone.I explained the numbers to the Vodafone advisor who still insisted that their deal was some how better. A lot of attention was focused on the cancellation fee that obviously I had already allowed for and factored in when comparing what was on offer.The advisor then proceeded to try and discredit Lit, saying they have never heard of them. I forwarded a link to their website. The advisor then said there wasn't any reviews, so I forwarded them a link to trustpilot where Lit score 4.9 out of 5. The advisor said that they didn't think I would get 6 months for free and to be careful incase it's a scam. They then said that the 6 months free is probably offered because they are a business that knows its going under. I explained it was to compensate people for the cancellation fee when switching mid contract. He then said that my contract will definitely still go up with Lit as all companies have to increase contracts based on CPI. I had to send a screenshot to the advisor to prove that Lit do not hike prices mid contract. This is also true for companies like Tescos mobile who also don't increase their prices.I feel like a lot of what I was being told wasn't strictly correct, so do be careful what you believe. The chat also went on for several hours despite me originally only contacting Vodafone to give my 30 days notice.I am, however, still suprised that Vodafone have a rating of 1.3 out of 5 on here. Despite my moan above, my service with Vodafone has been fantastic over the years that I've been with them. My speeds were always where they should have been and the service was very reliable with next to no drop outs. If there ever was a problem, Vodafone were quick to get it resolved.The low rating on here is quite harsh and not really a true reflection of them as a company. I would definitely consider moving back to Vodafone in the future if they have a good deal on.Unfortunately, being loyal to one company doesn't really work in the consumers favour and quite often results in prices continually increasing the longer you stay with them. As consumers, it is up to us to shop around for the best deals.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for a long time  6 months  ago they notified me they were carrying out works on the local mast nearby where we live , we are located in a rural area ,when we moved in 4G was the only way to get broadband we invested initially  in a Vodafone router but this wasnt suitable  , we used a tp link brilliant 15mb download  23 upload , now we barley get 1_2 mb even our mobiles  only show 1bar , despite emailing  phoning  all the same response nothing wrong in the area , complained on line no response , yesterday i emailed Vodafone  GH they responded in less than an hour suggesting I contact the uk sector but sadly their is nobody  that will help all you get is Vodafone technical says its all ok , so i purchased an o2 data sim well what can i say O2  30mb download speed ,update finally  they have confirmed the service is not as expected , they have provided a new sim in the broadband unit,this increased the download to 4mb we can live with for the next 12 weeks  as that's the date when Vodafone believe the service will be back to expectation.",1
Broadband is good enough but I haven’t been charged since renewing my contract months ago and getting hold of a customer service agent is impossible! Why should I spend hours of my time repeatedly calling them?,1
"I rung customer service to enquire if I could use my Internet outside EU, bare in mind that I have only basic package, sim only contract.Lovely man Fauz(apologies in advance if I have misspelled your name) answered the call. He was extremely helpful and understanding. He done all he could to help me to set up my phone to be able to use roaming abroad and to receive notifications of the usage and charges, I had a very pleasant experience dealing with Vodafone customer service.But after my trip to Latin America, I must say that it was pretty horrifying to discover that there was no use of any of that at all. My phone wasn't usable abroad.  No roaming was working, I had no data of what so ever, had no signal, couldn't call nor message.  Luckily enough that I have been spending time with my friends and I have been able to use their data and WiFi in hotel.I am still very happy with the person handling the call, because he was asking for advice on my query of his manager.  But the manager who ever it was should have done his homework before misleading people.",1
"An excellent service again from Staff at the Vodaphone store in Spalding. I had a problem accessing my phone.I visited unannounced, received a warm welcome, explained the issue to them in non technical terms and they immediately started to work on the problem and resolved it. I could not fault the service. It is so much better than the stores nearer to me in Peterborough and Stamford.",1
"2 days ago I tried to put £10 into PAYG.  The site kept crashing.Yesterday I got it to accept the £10 but failed to credit.I then spent ages on the landline to get it credited.  It then showed £10.46.Not trusting it, I checked to day.  It invited me to pay in again.  When I declined the £10.46 suddenly changed to £0.46.Edd: since I wrote that, a helpful Indian assistant on Vodavone (chat) sorted it out.  So I've upped it fo 3 stars.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for almost 25 years (!)In my experience, they have been the best network in terms of reliability for signal strength. Maybe I've just been lucky with the places I've lived but others around me on different networks have often struggled...On the downside, customer services has mostly been poor to infuriating. If the reliability of the network signal hadn't been so consistent, I would have left them years ago. Vodafone have absolutely no interest in customer retention. They've never given me a deal or discount on any contract. Business is business I suppose!",1
Vodafone offering new customers Deals at £22. Loyal customers zilch. So much for caring about your current customers!!!As to your reply why do you not say this in your advert??,1
"I spent the best part of 2hrs on the phone trying to merge two accounts into one. If it wasn't for ""Amy"" then I would have probably considered leaving. Real credit and was very helpful.",1
"Recently moved to Vodafone broadband. I was not informed that I would lose my pstn line as part of the move except for the dial tone. This means I cannot use any of my telephone extensions.I raised that with them but they are not able to offer any solution. I asked to cancel the service as this is useless to me but was informed that I was out of my cancellation period. I wish I had stayed with plusnet, they offer fantastic service.Update. Vodaphone came back and offered me the opportunity to cancel at no cost . They still need to be clear on the 60mbit product that people lost the old phone line.",1
Appalling .My broadband speed has dropped to unacceptable levels compared to service i pay for . I have spent nearly an hour going round in circles going nowhere trying to rectify situation. The app is useless and trying to contact someone to speak to is impossible . The chat bot is a complete joke . Im having no choice but to cancel contract and sign up whereelse with a provider that wants to offer some level of customer care and a decent reliable service.Following on... an hour later... the bot chat kicked in and actually managed to help escalate issue with engineers. Awaiting further tests but a little more hopeful than an hour ago.,1
"Joined vodafone in may 2021, the only complaint i have is that the vodafone  coverage map is totally useless,i go to places that have no coverage but according to the coverage checker its excellent.very misleading",1
"Poor service:  I Purchased a mobile phone via Vodafone I was told there would be a slight delay then got a message item to be delivered tomorrow. When it did not arrive after three days called customer service to enquire about my phone delivery. I was told oh the warehouse have not been notified! of your order we will inform them.When I asked will I get it for next week? the customer service agent dodged the question!! TWICE,  Still Waiting!!.I will not be ordering any other goods etc. from this company.Update on the 5th day the item was delivered I was eventually notified of delivery fortunately I had made no arrangements for the day of delivery. Accordingly I have made an amendment to my Review. When enquiring/purchasing I was not informed that the phone comes with no charging plug this has to be purchased separately!.",1
"Called in to upgrade and asked for price match with EE for my new contract as the current one is expiring end of the month. I am being told I need to pay an early termination fees for upgrade, when I asked if the new contract can start straight after my current contract ends the answer to that was no.I dont understand why they cant start my new contract when the current one ends, waste of time and money.Requested my PAC code to move to EE as they are offering same deal but without extra charge for ""early termination"". Shame that an existing customer of close to a decade is being treated like this just so they can make an extra £35 when my monthly bill is £70+.Edit: Received a call from Voda representative and they were able to settle this for me without an issue. I understand what early termination fee is for but customers should be offered the ability to line up another contract straight after current one expires. Issue resolved but shouldnt have occured to begin with.",1
"It's a mixed bag with VF. When I first came back to VF there were some issues with setup on my account, namely WiFi calling and VoLTE. I was surprised to get a call from a UK representative to follow up but the accounts/network team had actually fixed the issues already. This was a pleasant surprise after past experiences.Why have I marked them down? Simple, there is far too many times, not even in ""the sticks"", where I get a good 4G signal but no data throughput at all!! There are also too many times of dropping down to 3G as well with incredibly slow speeds. It is very clear after testing that VF are relying far too much on Band 20 (B20) to give coverage but it is being swamped too easily. Unfortunately they seem to be concentrating on 5G in cities where suburban and rural areas continue to suffer dire coverage and speeds!",1
"I've been with Vodafone for mobile and home broadband for years and never had any issues. I always found support efficient. However, my recent experience has wiped out any confidence that I had with them. Broadband upgrade to full fibre went off schedule when open reach didn't install the fibre optics in time.Not vodafones fault, but I was assured by vf that the install would still go ahead as planned. Waited in all  day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that the Installation date had moved by 3 weeks. Waited in all day for no one to arrive.Contacted vf to be told that it had now been moved by another 10 days.That's today.Contacted vf to find out what time today, to be told that the whole order has been cancelled, My adsl is due to be terminated this evening as part of the fibre upgrade.So I've no fibre and no Internet as from tomorrow.I'm stubborn and ordinarily I'd tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine, however the compensation due will be huge. Maybe pay for two years internet, so I'm sticking with them just for the fun of the compensation claim.edit 24.03.23:Vodafone did eventually complete my install, albiet about 38 days late.As they are signed up to the automatic compensation scheme, I was due compensation, to the tune of about £250.I did have to fight for this, however got there in the end.So whilst initially it was stressful, the compensation did end up paying about 15 months worth of my contract, and the connection has been great since.",1
I have been a vodaphone customer since April 2021.  Never a problem then in December 7th my internet stopped working. I work in care and due to Covid was working every day due to being short staffed so no time to call.I eventually called on the 18th December and had a video call with a lady. She was very helpful looked at my modem and everything but could not see what was causing the problem but confirmed my internet had been down since 7th of December which was day I had new carpets fitted. So she said an engineer would be out on Monday 20th but he didn’t turn up. My son was here on 3rd of January and fixed the problem in minutes.I then received a bill for 2 months so I called again and the caller told me engineer had called me on the 20th to say he was coming but had not missed calls on that day. She then sorted my bill so I only had to pay 1 month and insured me I would recieve compensation for all days after problem was reported. So far I’ve heard nothing. Very disappointed in poor service. Only giving 3 stars as the girls I spoke we’re really nice and as helpful as they could be.,1
"I have been with Vodafone broadband for 4 years. I have never had a problem. I moved house taking Vodafone with me and had no problems at all, although it was a hefty fee to move them with me (£60) and a month wait to get it installed, which I was told was normal across all companies?The speeds have been fine. Have had drop outs a few times a year but they are short lived and back to normal within minutes, nothing to get frustrated about. My husband says the internet is slow (we have the super fast fibre) and prefers to use his mobile data but I honestly do not notice the speed being slow, maybe because he doesn’t use it relieving the pressure of demand? All in all I would probably recommend Vodafone broadband. At the moment we are out of contract so our monthly payment is more than if we were in contract, I haven’t renewed a contract as I like the fact that I have the option to just leave if I want to, but so far I haven’t needed to. On the other hand I have had no end of trouble with Vodafone mobile contracts in the past but no problems for over a year now so fingers crossed 🤞 it stays that way.",1
"Eventually customer service sorted my issue, but before that it was a merry go round of speaking to different departments.My contract with Vodafone transferred to me in the middle of the month. I'd been with them for over a decade and never had problems. I'm on a plan with 25GB data per month. Then suddenly, two days into August, I get a text saying I had only 2GB worth of data left. Which made no sense as I was constantly using wifi at home and I work from home.The first person I spoke to said it was a glitch and that she would renew my data amount. Nothing happened.The second person said it was the 'transition period' of the contract transition, and that it would renew properly on the 8th of August, today. Nothing happened.On my third call, I spoke to someone who knew what they were doing and did a deep dig into my daily data use and summarised that I had used 9GB instead of 22GB when travelling the prior week, which made sense. However a colleague then told her that the day-by-day data wasn't accurate and that 22GB was correct, which also made no sense. He wasn't helpful, and reiterated it was on my end and not theirs.Under family advice I called up Retentions threatening to leave and got an extra 2GB for free as a good will gesture. Doesn't explain where 13GB went, but it's better than nothing.I will be doing better research into other providers next year as a back-up.",1
"I've been with Vodaphone for several years (phone contracts). I can't say the connection has ever been bad (so 5 stars for that) but it is hard work to call them. Is anyone any good at customer service??? On price, I have an issue. I'm way past my upgrade date and I get occasional offers 'just for me' (not explicit, but this is implied by the wording). The price has been no different to anyone else asking (i.e. via website as a ""new"" customer). Moreover, other suppliers are consistently cheaper, and by a lot. You get a £29 up front fee even for a PAYG contract on an iphone with Vodaphone, not so in other places, and it's £15 a month cheaper elsewhere for identical phone and terms. I phoned them to try to avoid the small amount of hassle to transfer my number elsewhere and offered to show proof of a better quote for the same contract. They wouldn't budge.They've largely ignored me for the best part of 10 years and within two hours of requesting a PAC code, they're phoning me! Too late, you made me feel as though I was inconsequential and not worthy of a comparable deal to your competitors.So overall, five stars for reliable phone connection, but 1 star for not making me feel like a valued customer, hence 3 stars on average.",1
June 2022:The Vodafone network has been down in postcode SK13 5DP for nearly 3 weeks. I received a text saying maintenance complete but the Vodafone network is still down in this area. There have been problems for 3 weeks now and no one at Vodafone seems to know what the problem is or when it will be fixed. Even their website shows the network is down. This is a rural area and people rely on their phones to keep in touch. Total shambles.July 17th 2022:After some investigation I have discovered that at the end of June 2022 Vodafone upgraded my local mast as part of maintenance program in preparation for 5G. The upgrade failed and the mast shutdown. My device then  connected to another mast further away greatly reducing my service (2 bars from 5 bars). The Vodafone website stated there was a fault for a few days and then said service was back to normal which it wasn't. After a coupe of weeks my service has improved and I am getting excellent down /upload speeds so it seems to have been fixed. Vodafone clearly had a problem and I just wish they would have been honest. Their contact centre and the TOBI app just lied to me or disconnected me when I tried to investigate the problem. Vodafone have provided me with good mobile service over the years but they really need to improve their contact centers who do not seem to have a clue when their is a major network outage.I have increased my rating as I am now getting excellent speeds. People on the Vodafone Forum were very helpful.,1
"One star, because this is the 3rd time Vodafone have screwed up causing chaos due to their clueless, incompetent and dishonest call centre staff. With her no longer needing it, I cancelled the line on our late mother's Apple Watch that has been a safety line for her. Vodafone forgot to cancel it leading to continued charges that totalled, wait for it, £12 or so. As a matter of principle, I refused to pay it and call centre staff said they would cancel and write it off - twice. A year later, they have raised the debt to £38, and it has appeared on Experian wrecking my otherwise good credit, causing chaos in my life. I wish to sue Vodafone for damages being it is impossible, even via Twitter messaging, to communicate with a real English first language human being. Their Twitter account says to use their useless online chat service! It's useless!(The other two instances: Despite arranging it before leaving for mainland Europe in 2014, Vodafone forgot to switch on travel roaming, so I was billed many times my actual call/data costs. They did refund the money/credit it, but error caused me much stress. This happened earlier too on a different trip.)Update - Sept 26 2022: Unbelievable, so Vodafone have pinned the blame on us, despite fact the account was closed and NO debt was due. What you are doing is fraud and dishonest. I spent ages on phone today to try and resolve this, but your staff needed 5 of 7 security questions answering, some of which were rediculous being we have no way of knowing dates of events long ago, forcing us to visit a store. Don’t forget, YOUR error is costing US money and inconvenience. It is unacceptable that you do not keep suitable records.Update - Matter resolved. Sad that I had to post here to get attention. Store staff v helpful. However, the confirmation email promised by call centre lady never arrived. As per my other reviews, all these issues will end when companies return to in person engagement and scrap chat bots and overseas call centres. We’re human.",1
"Today after 7 and a half years, I received my PAC code from Vodafone. I'm not going to write a dramatic 1 star review. My signal with Vodafone is generally strong and I've had no issues with customer services. But this company has consumer ethics problems.However, since COVID, the signal has not been as strong. I used to be the only person in my group of friends who used to get a signal at the football and now I'm not, it's as bad as the rest. So when I get e-mails telling me my prices are going up because of the cost of living, I expect to see my service being excellent. But unfortunately it went backwards.My bill has gone up and up and the cost of living raise was, I'm afraid, unfair, exploitative and the final straw and the reason I am leaving today. This is from the e-mail in March:""The monthly cost of your plan will go up from your April 2022 bill. As set out in the terms of your agreement with us, this increase is the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 5.4% (as published in January 2022) to support the rise in our running costs and keep up with increased demand, plus an additional 3.9% to continue essential investment in our network as we expand coverage.""This is frankly predatory and I will not support it. So I am off to Lebara - they use the Vodafone network and will charge me about a quarter of what I currently pay with a superior deal. I am sad to be leaving, I have been with Vodafone for the best part of 8 years. But the SIM only tariffs are no longer competitive, there was no real effort to keep my custom (not that I was ever going to stay) and I cannot emphasise enough how much I dislike that 3.9% rise. My coverage has got worse, not better, so previous rises are obviously not being spent wisely.In terms of coverage and overall experience, I have had few issues with Vodafone. In fact, they're pretty good. But the time has come to seek cheaper pastures elsewhere because a 9.3% rise when cost of living is out of control is predatory, exploitative and downright unfair.So you will get good coverage and friendly customer service experience, but you will pay for it and it will be outside of the amount you agreed to pay every month.Goodbye Vodafone. It's been fun.",1
"Whatever happened to Vodafone? Having returned after over 10+ years its very clear their customer service has diminished beyond any hope. Whilst buying a new contract via the Vodafone website store was a very straight forward pleasant experience - that I'm afraid is where the pleasant part of the buying experience ends.Speaking to anyone regarding an order afterwards is near on impossible, (waited over an hour half on hold..) live chat is as much good as a chocolate fireguard (when it working that is!) Vodafone seem to think its perfectly acceptable to fob off customers with ""DPD will be touch when your phone is ready for delivery"" while you simply wait...& wait....& wait....hardly no communication on whats going on at all? Tracking provided just sits there with no movement. Twitter support, although friendly advised my order was taken off back order & shouldn't be too long, but zero movement on my tracking.The whole experience has been totally dreadful & I really regret it. I very much doubt I'll get delivery before Xmas Day now, but I have ceased caring if honest.The whole buying process has been a pointless, time-wasting & completely frustrating experience.Whilst I appreciate when things go great few people actually give good feedback, but when its bad they are quick to criticise. I give feedback on my own personal experience (positive & negative) but honestly, do think twice before you buy from Vodafone, worst experience ever (and many think Three UK is bad, oh no..Vodafone is far far worse - I should know I've been with Three for like 10+ years)My feedback to Vodafone would be to sort out your disastrous customer care, non existent communications & false delivery promises. Sadly I expected better from Vodafone. I dont really care anymore when my order arrives as it will be promptly returned back to you for a refund.I'm no longer interested in any further interaction with anyone from Vodafone, so please dont bother with a ""copy n paste"" generic reply. The main purpose of this review is to simply give feedback to other prospective customers.Edit: Since found out via my official complaint my order didn't even exist even after taking £100, receiving all contract docs & a hard credit check on my file. They want me to cancel & re-order? Amazes me how you manage to keep customers, shocking!Edit: Resolved via Exec Office, I have increased my  score rating purely based on how exceptional my complaints case manager (Andy) & an amazingly helpful Sales advisor (Sarge) resolved this today. Be thankful you have these guys @Vodaphone they restored my confidence that ""some"" people DO care about customers within your company. Give them a medal on my behalf.",1
"Signed up for a SIM only contract and got the SIM within a couple of days. All the packaging said it was already activated but it still didn't work 24 hours after installing. I also couldn't log onto my account using the temporary password I'd been emailed. This would only ever give a message that an error has occurred and to try again a moment later.I used the webchat to complain and was told my account hadn't been activated and would be sorted within 24 hours. It wasn't so I tried again the next day to be told it would be done by midnight. Again, it wasn't so I contacted them again and got told 24 hours once again. This time I waited another 2 days before contacting them to be told it would be done by midnight. A day later and I still have no mobile.From what I can see, Vodafone are utterly useless. I've had enough and since I'm still within my 14 day cool off period I'll be ringing up to cancel later. My hopes of Vodafone actually managing that without charging me again are slim.18/03/22 A further update. I just had the most painful conversation ever with someone presumably in India when attempting to cancel the contract. The call seemed to be on a 10 second delay the whole time and mostly consisted of her saying ""Hello"" over me repeatedly. She couldn't find my account for the first 15 minutes because I couldn't give them a mobile number I didn't have. Then when she did find my account, I was told my contract couldn't be cancelled because my account wasn't active and I would need to ring back in 24 hours. After venting for a while about why I wasn't going to do this, and how this was in breach of consumer rights, she said they would ring me back on Monday between and 1 and 2.  I couldn't take any more and reluctantly accepted. This level of service is so poor it beggars belief. I'll go straight to complaints when they presumably don't ring back on Monday. If that doesn't work, next stop will be the ombudsman.22/03/22 I didn't get a call back and the account still isn't activated. I got a reply to this review from Vodafone suggesting to contact the social media team via Facebook/Twitter. I had to sign up to Twitter specifically for the purpose but finally got a clear answer that they apparently won't activate the SIM and account until the day my old number is due to switch on 1st April. This isn't how a switch has worked for me in the past but they also confirmed my cancellation period won't start until then so I'll give them a last chance. The moral of all this seems to be to avoid Vodafone's call centres and go to their social media team if you want any help.06/04/22My account activated as promised above and I've had no problems since. Still not happy with the state of the service I received or the contradictory communication about how the switch process worked in the first place but I'm revising up to 3 stars since they did at least get there in the end.",1

"been a customer on and off for 22 years, and they re not to bad, I can get signal most places, and the speed it reasonable 9 times out of 10.However, they're not cheap, don't really reward loyalty and can be a bit of a nightmare to speak to when things go wrong or you want to know or do something that is nt on the agent's script.The voice recognition thing is a very annoying as well.hence middle of the road 3 stars.In response to them below - please answer your phones don't rely on facebook, or twitter, if you want to talk to me about and it's so important you have my phone number...........",1

"When I first ordered the Vodafone deal, I was explained the discounts from my work place were applied, it wasn't and for almost a year I was paying the full contract price. Until I lost all three careers I had in a month, I had to pursue the deal to help me out of debt. It took me like 3-5 calls to customer service in Egypt to resolve this matter. The hassle and time it took get my discount reinstated was seriously out of order.Finally managed to speak to a really good customer service agent that applied the discount and 1 month free. He provided excellent customer communication from Egypt. He was smooth, understanding and delivered results. The reference of this call was (K24YBOVQ).3 stars given because I went through madness to get my entitlement by then what was the point, if all my receiving calls are going straight to voicemail. Even though my silent mode and do not disturb mode is off. This issue was raised over 2 months ago and again I was told it was resolved. But it wasn't and were back to square one again, customer agents spitting false promises. I have missed so many important calls this past year and the contract is still effecting my life other ways.",1
"I bought a mobiphone for £11:00 and had problems using it. I could not go to the shop because of the loony lockdown nonsense. I had to phone ""customer Service"" they were as much use as a chocolate Teapot.  I went back to the store in time to find out the idiot in some Asian country had changed my package by cancelling it and given me a new one and lost my  initial £10.  I was in the Harrow store and it was ""sorted out"" by some person and without telling me my new £20 on the phone was going to cost me £1:00 to send a text with 4 charactors in it!  Today customer service confirmed I was on the package I did not want nor was told about the disgusting charges.  they could do noting and their english was APPALLING! So I have destroyed the phone and gone to another provider who is simply going to charge me 5p when i send a text which is about twice a month.BEWARE OF VODFONE AT ALL COSTS.  Whatever the Sales person says make them put it in writing or walk out of the shop.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Don't bother VOdaphone you have lied too many times.  I have switched to 1p mobile who ACTUALLY do charge 1p a text rather than £1.00 a text like you swindlers!Oh and with a PAC code I can keep my numberSo GOD bless1pMobile they do let you keep your phone number and only charge 1p a text or 1p a minute for a call, and you only HAVE to credit £10:00 every 3 months A BETTER DEAL THAN ANY VODAPHONE PACKAGE.GOOD RIDDENCE!!!!!You can thank the liar at HARROW for you losing you yet onother customer!!!!!",1
"The deals aren't the best on the market. I never really had an issue with them, swapped to them from EE (really disliked EE) stayed with them after my contract ended, changed to sim only contract, and when my discount on my account came to an end over a year later. I called, online chatted multiple times, got passed onto someone else, and no matter how many times I asked for the discount to be added back onto my account, they weren't arsed.They just wanted to give me less, for more money. I even quoted other companies deals that beat theirs and still didn't budge, said I'd leave and theyd lose me as a customer all together meaning 0 money at all to them.. Again not bothered.Left and went with Lebara for half the price (permanently. Not a temporary deal)",1
"I had a problem with Vodafone charging me for a while month when I had finished the service mid month. Since my last review, they have now refunded me thankfully. I still think the internet was not good though.",1
"Bad experience from start. Started live chat re concern my contract has been sent to wrong email address (  the store may have got the email address wrong).  That chat ended half down the line, I can't even log on the app to register as it asks for code which it's impossible to retrieve as we signed up got sim 4g router. Customer service  is definitely not great. The advisor I spoke to just wanted to end the call quickly and was not helpful. Better to sign up with 30days contact for sure.",1
"An absolute disgrace. I upgraded last September to the IPhone 12 (I moved to EE) it took countless phone calls to get them to finally cancel my old contract even though I had finish the 24 month term.They finally cancelled it in January. In June my credit score now shows 2 missed payments from them.They never contacted me about this.Not only did they basically refuse to cancel my contract for months, they then never told me they still wanted money after it was cancelled.They have completely screwed me and my credit score which will hurt me when I need a loan or mortgage etc.An utter disgrace of a company I will never use again.I want to add a P.S. after a few phones calls and a long call they took the arrears away, I wrote this review when I shouldn’t have, in the heat of the moment. During my 24 month contract they were a great company, but between last September/October to now (June) it’s been horrible, but they did take the arrears off saying mistakes were made by them in reference to contacting me about a payment etc. So fair play to Vodafone for doing it. I want to leave my review up because it really has been horrible trying to get away from Vodafone but I’m not too big of a man to realise that I wrote it when I was angry.",1
"My bill is apparently £10 but I’m being charged £17, and am unable to get through to customer service. Avoid.Edit: called 191 and eventually got through to a customer service rep.",1
"Asda have transferred fron EE to Vodafone so it was either accept it or go somewhere else for my PAYG.  And there's less and less choice.Asda were 8p a minute for mobile calls with a Customer Service call centre in the North East, with great staff (who, as it happens, are employed by EE). That's all changed now. Asda Mobile Customer Service (i.e. Vofafone) are in Egypt and whilst they seem to know what they're doing and are polite and as helpful as they can be the lines aren't great (poor reception) and there isn't the same ease of conversation that there was with UK based staff.However calls are now down to 4p per minute (or they are for the time being) and you just need to make one, six monthly, chargeable text or call to keep the account active. No obligatory top up every six months.'Three' used to have something similar but their rates went up recently and their customer service was patchy. So it's all change - and it's likely to keep changing.",1
"""Reply from Vodafone UK2 hours agoHey there,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. We're sorry to hear you're having trouble logging into your online account.Please send us a message on Facebook at (can't re-post link). or via Twitter - (can't re-post link), where one of our team will be happy to assist you.Thanks,Vodafone Social Media Team""I understand and appreciate that you're trying to be helpful but i'm nearly 60, i'm deaf, and I don't have any sort of mobile phone. I'm not on any social media, only a few internet forums.My previous supplier has since contacted me to resolve their previous issue and i've decided to stay with them. I contacted your web chat to cancel but I can't cancel by web chat or email. I have to cancel through the 0808 0034515 phone line. Web chat did give me a 17 digit reference code and put a note on my account so the person taking the call could understand it wouldn't be me, (the account holder), who was phoning to cancel. We've tried this once so far but were cut off after 14 minutes. I'm not criticising Vodafone staff or their product, but it is frustrating.",1
"A bit painful overall unfortunately, but the customer staff were as great as they could be.Saw a great offer online in March for Samsung S21 5G, Unlimited Max plan. With a guaranteed trade in of my S10e (subject to meeting conditions), £44 per month (24 months). Great deal!Placed order Wed 31 Mar after 10.00pm, so too late for next day delivery. Fine. It's Easter weekend so can wait until the following Tues.Received email confirmation 22.31 for delivery on Tues 6 Apr. Nothing delivered.On inquiring, response was that the order was cancelled due to a 'technical issue'. No reason for error given, or why no follow up email to tell me. Passed around from initial complaints to upgrades to customer care, back to upgrades, etc.... Upshot - I can upgrade but only at today's (7 Apr) rates (which, shock, are not as generous); not the one I thought I signed up to (when I got my last phone, the following month the plan price went down. I had no recourse to ask for a better rate though...)Small print online states the contract only applies 'when the product is dispatched'. Not when you click that button to purchase. Not when you get the confirmation email. Not when you get it in your grubby little mitts. But only when dispatched. As such, it appears that if the courier loses it, or it is delayed... you are still liable to pay the prevailing rate (until found or proved stolen, I assume). If the order is cancelled by Vodafone (for any one of a number of reasons - or none, just a 'technical error'...), unlucky, no contract stands. The risk is transferred to you, my friends. Tell me I am wrong, Vodafone. Then I will show you your own terms and conditions.If you order online, get a confirmation and take a day off and get no email to say it is cancelled. Unlucky as no contract. And you cannot then ask for the original terms to be honoured as the 'deal is no longer available'. Those good old T&C.What was good was the attitude of all the customer support staff I engaged with. They got it. They listened. They were obviously limited by company policy. After putting in a formal (email) written complaint since the phone system just wasn't working, I got a response very quickly and the guy was great. The key thing was the confirmation email I received, that proved I had made the order - it was the only evidence as 'nothing was in the system' (don't delete those emails, folks). Complaint upheld in terms of cancellation made without my knowledge and no confirmatory email sent to me. Nonetheless, the 'technical issue' won through and those pesky terms and conditions (weighted in favour of the company) won out. Legally right; morally...?I have to comment I did go ahead with an upgrade, after being offered 25% discount on another monthly plan; it would be wrong not to disclose this. The deal was decent but not anywhere near as good as that which I thought I had committed to.In short. Customer service were actually really decent and I truly appreciate their attempts to help. But the company-level T&C element leaves the customer in a weak position if things go wrong. You takes your chance folks!",1
Good service but needs to be more efficient when dealing with customer billing problems.I called and the representative was helpful and kind but had to keep putting me on hold to find things out.Overall happy and thanks for the refund for over charge on retail index review.,1
I have been a customer of vodfone mobile it not to bad but I would not go with the broadband it not good but ha I’m with by on broadband and there staff are really bad there made 54 bill and Service scissors people not come to fort thinks out I fand vodfone mobile are better if only the people in the mobile time work with the broadband side it mite be better but any how EE STAY CLEARE IT LIKE Jumping in front of a bus really bad I mean bad it bad talk talk we’ll I have been with them not bad but you pay for what you get slow speed lol 02 mobile stay clear as well I’m staying with vodfone yes there do make mistakes but there do sort it out in the end much but then o2 BT talk talk EE  hope this is help full 👍,1
"I recently inherited a locked to vodafone iphone, the customer service was excellent (when I finally got through) and the phone was unlocked in 24hrs. The main problem is the price and coverage. I have been with Vodafone for 20 years in business and private use. They are great if you live in a major city or only travel on motorways, in the countryside their coverage is poor and the pricing is high unless you haggle hard. Piggy back companies like Lebara offer great deals using the Vodafone network so why can't they offer better prices themselves. I think it is a stagnant company and will continue to lose private custom in favour of business clients",1
"I recently reviewed Vodafone & subsequently added an update, in both posts I slated the company both for keeping me waiting around seven weeks for finally connecting me to broadband & also for the poor customer service. Since my update things have improved a bit so I thought it only fair to also let others know they can do some things right (eventually).They admitted that the service I had received was not acceptable & for that they are giving me an £80 credit, additionally it turned out that although I had signed up for superfast 2 which is up to 63Mbps with a minimum guarantee of 55Mbps, after further tests it seems my line will only support a sync speed of 39.8Mbps, however I was prepared to accept their offer of a reduction in my monthly charges from £23pm to £19.50 as the speed I am getting is ok for my particular needs.It remains to be seen if I continue to get this speed & hopefully don't suffer any disconnections or any discrepancies with my bills.Overall though if it all stays as it is now I will be satisfied with what I have ended up with.",1
"Vodafone set us up quickly, and we had a much faster line than advertised. However, we came home one day and our Internet wasn't working. Contacted support who advised us our account had been cancelled, so they setup an engineer to reconnect us 2 days later. Still no Internet from then so phoned again and was told that the exchange was broken and that in 2 days open reach would be out to fix. Phoned back again 2 days later and was told that the open reach appointment was never scheduled and that in 2 days it would be fixed, surprise surprise no Internet 2 days later and this time told he didn't have the right materials to fix the exchange. Asked for a 4g dongle to keep us connected and were told no as we are not moving house so we asked to cancel and move to another provider, after cancelling we were transferred to customer service who offered us a 4g dongle but were told that the 18.50/month we had agreed to would be going up to 23.50/month. This all happened because apparently we are supposed to phone Vodafone and tell them that our Internet is working? Would avoid at all costs. Just spend an extra couple of quid a month and go to a better provider",1
"I've been with Vodafone for 11 years. 11 years. Now generally that means something for a lot of companies but not Vodafone. Their loyalty discounts are offensive.Anyway, it was that time to renew again. I have had sim only contracts for the last 6 years as I don't care anymore for the latest phone. I was sad to see that I could either get way more than I needed for more money or way less than I needed for the same money. Why can't I just stay on the same plan?This time I considered a phone because mine was on it's way out and thought in the end that I just couldn't simply afford it. Until I went to carphone warehouse where if I started a new contract with Vodafone I would get the latest phone (S21) cheaper than what Vodafone themselves were offering me... what a way to feel valued.I love vodafone I always have. Their signal has been amazing in my area and I love the nostalgia I feel as unlike o2 (once upon time one-2-one) they haven't gone through a name change or anything in the 30 years I've roamed England. Just why disrespect the loyal customers? Don't pretend to be offering me a deal when really I'm being ripped off.My reason for writing this review is due to the odd system I had to go through to change my mobile number from a vodafone sim only contract to my new vodafone contract. I had to order a pay as you go sim, transfer my number to that, then transfer my number to my new vodafone contract sim. WHY?! Please Vodafone, if you can - SORT THIS OUT. Along with your loyalty offers. Either genuinely offer a good deal that you cannot get ELSEWHERE or don't bother. I didn't bother calling to cancel because I don't like the Non-UK based call center.This time you keep my custom, but next time - you may not be so lucky...",1
"Online contact doesn't work, automated phone help machine is useless. Help is good when you actually get to speak to someone.I can't log-in to my Vodafone online account as it's sending the access code to my landline via text message, which doesn't work.I try to contact Vodafone using the ""online"" function, but this opens a webpage that never actually loads - great.I call Vodafone, and battle an automated help machine that repeatedly tries to tell me that I can do anything I want via my online account settings (failing to understand that I can't log in), before eventually (and I mean eventually) telling me it will transfer me to someone. The phone rings a few times and then hangs up.2 minutes later, I'm about to leave a scathing review, when my phone rings with Vodafone customer services there, who take me through security and then fixes my log-in problem.So, 5 stars for calling back and fixing the problem quickly - 1 star for the online contact not working and the automated help machine.",1
Everything is slow - why does it take 1hr + to do anything with them - renewing a contract shouldn't be so painful. They also made my contract worse than before - only 100 mins in Europe instead of 500 - dont feel this was clear and appealing this so difficult. Gave up after 45 mins on the phone on a Saturday - I have better things to do!,1
Assured it was a simple process to port my number into vodafone. Its now a week and I still cannot use my phone to dial out or send messages or use data. No timescale on when it will be fixed. Unfortunately now in a position that I have ordered a sim with another company and lost my number as I don't trust it will ever be resolved.At 15:09 5 mins after posting my initial  review on trustpilot I got a message saying my port in is complete. Dont know if its a coincidence or not but changed to a higher rating on the basis its now sorted.,1
"My broadband order was due to go live on 10th of December, but this failed and the date was stealthily moved back by 4 days, leaving me unable to work from home.Vodafone have at least tried to help though, by offering unlimited data on a SIM card so that I can continue to work. So thanks for that Vodafone, but you really should have completed my broadband order on time.",1
"Back on today after 5 days no serviceEventually sorted out ,and rectified amicably.If you contact the right people ....... it gets sorted 👍 ceo by email 😂",1
"After happily using Vodafone for mobile for years I recently moved house and got their broadband installed. To be fair, surprisingly easy to get hold of customer services via chat or on the phone, but had to speak to them SIX times just to get the router sent to the right place - not one agent I spoke to did what they said they would do until the sixth person. Systems between Vodafone and their delivery partner DPD (useless company) clearly do not work at all. Even when the router was eventually delivered over a week late ('typical' according to the BT installation engineer) the DPD guy came back later in the day to ask for the package back! I refused, obviously, and now all seems to be working fine. Pure chaos, as usual with DPD. Three stars as service eventually seems to be good, but setup process unnecessarily hectic and stressful during a house move. Vodafone you desperately need a dedicated process for people moving house!",1
"My dealings with them have been ""fine"" so far, a little expensive on mobile broadband with few options, but supposedly no throttling and truly unlimited which is nice. Would be nice to have a cheaper option for those of us in areas that don't get 5g and even very bad 4g signals.I'd be happy for a cheaper package on pure 3g but with still unlimited data. Currently I pay £33 a month for around 15mbps at best which is very expensive compared to wired/fibre broadband. It's acceptable though since I have very few choices of networks that actually serve me out here in the country.",1
Not as bad in my experience as most of the reviews. I mean fiver a month 4 payg wiv 300 mins n 3gb data plus rollover to make it 6gb! Dat is better n most cheap sim only dealsJust need better customer service loggin cuz man is always havin 2 explain imself ova n ova again....like a stuck record lol,1
"Went from 1  to  3 been completely messed around so much inconvenience ringing, emailing, online etc. Didnt bill me in the end but they need to look at their app sliders and barsMade a mistake on their app. Used the bars and sliders and couldnt work out which one was yes/no. Really confusing.Got charged £46 instead of £12 and they lad i spoke to tried to remove the charges as i hadnt used any of the data and records showed i was having problems.  Offered 10% off so i closed my 3 accounts with them. £429 a year theyre happy to lose for £36. Shocking middle management.  Ill never again use vodafone",1
"I need a replacement pay as you go SIM card and went online to order one. No facility to do that. Have to chat  to an advisor. Can't, because they don't have any. At all. None. No advisors at all. Because of Coronavirus. So I give them a ring. No advisors. At all. Because of Coronavirus. Go into a store? Nearest is 20 miles away. And why should I?Suffix: I did finally get through to an advisor, who was excellent. The new nano-SIM to replace my mini-SIM is arriving within a couple of days. So a good result.BUT come on, Vodafone, by now you should have this all sorted with advisors WFH if necessary. 'Coronavirus' is no longer an adequate excuse for under-resourced customer services.",1
Been with Vodafone for a good few years with no problems but now I think is a Joke of a company when all I want is to add the apple watch to my account.UPDATE after 5 days of emails and a big fat headache I have finally got an email saying I can have the watch that I wanted but it's now on back order which it was not the first day I tried to order one. So really I will have waited 10-12 days just to get an apple watch which is a sad amount of time messing about3 days have passed and still Vodafone has not sent a stock up like email says this is getting beyond a joke. A mate applied for the same item today and is getting his apple watch delivered tomorrow. Joke joke joke,1
Vodaphone treats Channel Islands as an International Destination and charges accordingly which is ridiculous or a deliberate rip-off. For £3/month you can have 100 free minutes to 100 international destinations around the world but the Channel Islands is not included in this list despite being only 150 miles away - this tends to confirm it is a deliberate policy to maximise earnings.,1
"I got my phone+sim plan on Carphone warehouse. Vodafone was the one I picked and during 2 years, I never had any complaint, to be honest. Good signal, very clear bills and internet speed was good.But after 2 years, my contract ended and I received a phone call asking if I wanted to renew.Since I wanted the Samsung S20 but the price was higher than what I could afford, I was told that I could do a SIM-only plan and upgrade after 3 months to add a phone. Note that the employee didn't mislead me.The problem is that now, I went to check the upgrade plans for a new phone (S20 for example) and if I do an upgrade, I will pay more 200 pounds at the end of 2 years, compared to if I got a new plan.The problem is that I am stuck in a 2 years contract...where I am losing, and any new customer for Vodafone gets better deals than me that I am a customer for 2+ years.Loyalty not only means nothing to Vodafone, also it seems they laugh at your face by having awful prices for ""loyal"" customers and great prices for whoever is a potential customer.Once I finish the 2 years, I will change to another operator that hasn't played me around like this.So people, you know it, is your first plan? maybe accept. Renew? Don't be a fool like me....",1
"So this review is really just to warn Vodafone and their customers, my wife ordered an Ipad with Vodafone and it was delivered by DPD and their driver left it lying on my front doorstep for anyone to steal. I was lucky that a neighbour took it in, but it made me wonder how many other parcels he left on peoples doorsteps. Totally disgusting.",1
"After giving Vodafone a bad review last time, they have been very helpful with a problem with intermittent broadband, which is down to a fault on the line,its obvious as the phone doesn't work!!!I just find it stupid when you ring up to speak to someone about broadband not working you get a recorded message to say its quicker to go onlinewhen you cant go online GRRR",1
I bought the sim card advertise 15 GB Data and 250 min  sim card arrive late even than they give 500mb data a day and daily usage £1 its a joke someone legally selling online sim card display 15gb data and 250 min for £10 month  once you buy they put on sim plan only . and even than they overcharge on daily plan . than they refund after long argument.very bad companythat is ripe off in day light . this complain will fwd to offcom .cusservice people hang the phone once i call them in first call . they promise manager will call you in 24hrs 48 hrs gone no one call so far  again call they put request to speed up and someone call you still pending .Know they call me and give me bundle as i paid for.but gone through lot of issue once it actually arrive finally.,1
"It has taken months to get my speed problem fixed, though I realise COVID and OpenReach should bear a lot of the responsibility. Even so (this accounting for the 3 stars), their service personnel are excellent, friendly, efficient, apologetic!! I was particularly impressed by Kirsty and Mohammed Saif -- their service skills are outstanding.",1
"pretty good broadband and mobile contract, useless customer service.had a problem while switching broadband, they prosponed connection date by 2 weeks then the offer i was signing up for expired. they put me on a contract that was 50% more expensive including the bonus i got for being an existing mobile customer. after 2 months i was refunded but most of the customer service people could not help, then by strike of luck i got through to someone who did know what they were doing. None of the previous conversations were noted on account but im just happy its sorted.the broadband is exactly what i now payed for and never had a problem with the mobile side of things.",1
"Ehab was so helpful! I’ve been having problems with bringing my phone number over from an old sim to my new one (hence the 3 stars due to delays and previous customer service experience when calling to ask how to swap it). I called the complaints department and was put through to Ehab, the most cheerful, patient and helpful person I’ve ever spoken to on the phone. I called looking for actual help not to complain about the problem which I’m sure they get a lot. The problem is not yet solved but hopefully will be in the next 24hours. Just wanted to let the company know what an asset they have in him.",1
"I can say i'm a fairly new Vodafone user, and their customer service has been good so far, with one exception of an incident.. that was mostly due to a misunderstanding. Still, gotta be cautious with my rating.",1
So far on accepting order seems good will review when service active surely they cannot be as bad as a BT company rep saying BT equipment and company crap,1
The broadband is incredibly unstable. We had no issues with previous supplier so really regret switching to Vodafone now. They're also not responding to my complaint. Avoid.*Update: to be fair to Vodafone they've since kept in weekly touch with us to try and resolve this for us.  Matter still ongoing at the moment.,1
"I have been a Vodafone customer for the past five years. It's ok, but not great. Customer service could be better especially waiting time. But overall ok service.",1
"Been with Vodafone for 14year (mobile). Just upgraded, the rep gave me 40% discount which was a mistake on their behalf. But they tried to get me to pay for their mistake. After a lot of phone calls and telling me customer services would phone me back at a certain time, they would phone me at the wrong time, eg at work the next day. In the end they gave me 30% off and the difference for the 24 month contract. So got to thank you. Because it got sorted hopefully will continue with them as I have never had a problem with them before. Their fair if you set your case.",1
"Website has been trashed, can no longer easily set up payment methods, i cancelled 2 mobile broadband numbers and nothing actually happened their side, had to call up again a month later and ask the same thing again. The customer support needs sorting out or self service online website like before.",1
Recent great customer service from a Melissa.  She had gone way beyond expections and due to me being a penisioner it was very hard.  Warmst regards from myself and Mrs Jones.  Just wish there was a easier way to get through.,1
"Used Vodafone broadband for two landlines. Similar experience with bothThe Good:No problems with router and broadband service was reliable throughoutThe Bad:During activation, messed up the landline numbers for numbers I've had for years. Why ?  I've switched between BT, EE, PlusNet and TalkTalk before with no messing up of landline numbers. But Vodafone seem to do it :-(  To their credit they eventually restored the old numbers but I spent several days with a different landline number which means friends with your old number cannot call you and two factor authentication call back services (e.g. HMRC) are non-operational until the old phone numbers get restored. Other providers simply don't cause this hassle - why do Vodafone when they also use the BT OpenReach networkBilling system charges for services that Vodafone no longer supply. In two cases Vodafone generated bills for services that were already out of contract and had already been switched and transitioned to another supplier. In case #1 they said the next bill would credit the overpayment -- it didn't, it simply carried on billing for the service no longer being provided -- so more complaints. In case #2 the exact same story -- the next bill will be a credit -- except it is not a credit, it simply carries on billing. This billing practice is shocking -- I wonder how many other people are simply being billed when they switched away long ago ?Complaints line only seems to handle mobile complaints. Broadband is ""another department"". Took 5 phone calls and 2 disconnections to get through to make a complaint and various tall tales were provided about me having to request refunds from my new broadband provider and having to provide Vodafone 30-days notification when switching despite OFCOM rules clearly saying otherwise. Again, simply shockingSummary: Broadband OK, but initial setup and billing when you move away are sub-standard. My goodness you need to watch these supposedly reputable suppliers",1
"I have mainly enjoyed saving more on their rewards system than paying in bill, but my personal win aside they are just ok Tobi inside their app is just useless and don't bother with one of there advisors as they won't tell you anything useful. Was given three different pieces of information on whether my plan had roaming inside the eu but they have not been as bad as some other companies I have dealt with recently.",1
"I have to say, as being “tech-Savy” I am appalled at how firstly, customer service is and secondly, why you won’t return my call or reply to my emails about my bill. This is now 2 months bills that I’ve gained extra charges for abroad (when haven’t left UK since Oct 2019)Disappointed as I have been with your provider since I was 19.",1
"Latest Review (three-and-a-half stars)The company answered my questions forthrightly over the phone and also put the price down from what it was, which was a nice surprise, the service now being (substantially more) worth the monthly cost.Technical-wise, the internet has been impressive, able as we are now, to stream without interference, the BBC at best-quality, sometimes, and (not a fan of...) Amazon Prime at best-quality.Am hoping to implement call-forwarding, in attempts to try out different routes for connection, and if everything goes as well as it currently does, am thinking it might work.No reason to change company as-of-yet and am pleased to have stuck around for the long-haul.The deficit in the star-rating is the issue of mobile-phone protocols: on 3G-only phones, you cannot be on the internet and a call at the same time (why I am trying call-divert), which does not allow for the fact that some people use older phones.Older Review (company had two stars)In trying to think of positive things to say about the public sector and PLCs and communication companies of the private sector, have found it immensely difficult.This particular mini-dictatorship does at least provide fast enough speeds behind the hype. And as such, am able to stream live-TV using Mobile Hotspotting.However, those who take up the helm in the handling of customer queries (in particular, those higher up the ladder-of-ambition, snugly buckled into their Imperial Fleet seating arrangements), unfortunately do not seemingly have any business training, personable skills or sense of ethics under their belt to undertake such bouts and in doing so deliver way under an acceptable standard in these areas, whilst making efforts to conceal attempts at enforcing the dark-side.The company does as such:They advertise Unlimited Mobile services and yet the services are very much limited -1. Wildly fluctuating downloads speeds - down to minimal speeds (they do pick up as well; hence the two-star rating)2. Huge latency figures (a known issue)3. Bandwidth that is so narrow that one cannot make a phone-call and be on the internet at the same time4. Dystopian rule (we are not sons and daughters of their clonèd regime)Personal experiences:When asking for a 'letter of deadlock' was told that a gratuity they had GIVEN and of which I made sure - in writing - was a gift-of-no-clauses, stated they would retrieve the fifty-pounds (already-banked) by force if I requested a 'letter of deadlock' in order to take the company up on the bandwidth issue.They came up with the resolution, to grant a piece of equipment that might help to widen the bandwidth and after I checked with their technical team as to whether this equipment would actually sort out the problem, and to which I received an affirmative, the offer was retracted, Vodafone continuing to refuse making satisfaction.Their advertising does not stipulate that Mobile Hotspotting will consist of poor performance but instead makes out that one is getting a super package for the price when in fact the amount is approaching the price for a broadband and phone deal that some (other) companies offer.I am fairly convinced that there is deliberate and secret capping of services as the company tries to push customers onto broadband deals instead of the monthly sim-deal accounts because line-broadband deals make more money, i.e:- instead of being an all-inclusive phone and internet deal, customers that are paying for a line-connection (with Vodafone) would have to pay equal to monthly mobile phone and internet prices for broadband-internet alone...plus...whatever else for a phone-line. Many-a-time told there would manifest some kind of resolution, advertising literature for broadband would instead be thrown at me.After having been kept in an online chat for about five to six hours, any ideas whatsoever as to some kind of resolution were voided, except for the (repeated) solution - not initially linked with this complaint - put forward in particular by those representing the company's CEO, to leave the contract free of charge.The problem comes down to the fact that these companies do not respect the duty in their hands to deliver a high standard of service because they do not value the technology that is in their hands at the outset - wrong people in the wrong jobs.Essentially, we are talking about professional advertising that masks back-street trading.",1
"3* for broadband but 0* for all else!Warning: Vodafone deny all responsibility for missing Amazon vouchers!I applied to Vodafone January 2020 because of their well advertised £100 Amazon voucher offer with the claim that I'd receive an email after 120 days for such a voucher.120 days have passed and whilst the fiber broadband has been acceptable (not really surprising because ultimately it's BT that provides the connectivity infrastructure and so that's not physically changed from when I switched from Sky), no Amazon voucher was forthcoming.This was despite it being clearly advertised on the first page of the Vodafone application journey.Having queried this initially with Vodafone they were initially very helpful and indicated the date at which 120 days is met.This however came and went, so my subsequent web chat with Vodafone resulted in them effectively denying all responsibility for the missing voucher - despite it clearly being shown as part of **their** application process; instead trying to suggest that because the offer was provided by the website *from which** I clicked to get into the Vodafone website!In fact they also claimed the offer was non-existent at the time!I don't think that just because the deal was shown on the MoneySavingExpert.com website from which I clicked though to the Vodafone website to apply is at all responsible for honoring the voucher code somehow!Either way it is completely unacceptable for my to chase a voucher that formed part of the original application and thus my contact with them!UPDATE: 06/06/2020 - After getting in touch with Vodafone, and writing this review, and also then chasing the 3rd party voucher provider Vodafone mentioned during my complaint, surprise surprise I received an email from the 3rd party company within hours! Not sure what happened to resolve this, apart from my frustration in having to chase this up myself, but I have increased this review from 2* to 3* as my complaint is now fully resolved; still - I shouldn't have had to complain in the first place (hence no higher rating!)",1
I am grateful that there are people like Masry (a person who works for Vodafone). We just signed a contract with this company and we had two problems that he was very good at solving. Happily there are still people like Masry doing their job properly.,1
"I've been with vodafone for a couple of year now. Great service for data and text's, had a few issue's with calls in the home. not always working.My Main gripe with vodafone is that there customer service has no empathy when you can't pay your bill due to the on going crisis that the world is experiencing in which my job was no longer available and i ended up on benefits. After contacting vodafone if they could reduce my plan and help me to manage my bill's during this particular time, all i got was upselling me with new products. Now for me i'm struggling to pay my phone bill, why would i buy more products from yourselves.On top of this, constantly getting daily SMS's after i have spoken to Vodafone customer service with a 'Promise to Pay'.I believe Vodafone customer service needs work to keep there customer's happy and loyal.",1
"Absolute nightmare. I went for a simple upgrade via chat and they placed the wrong order. Since January I've been trying to fix it. Contacted them several times. I've spoken with at least 15 customer services representatives and spent at least 10 hours. Every time they say ""don't worry. I'll fix it"" and every time they fail. I was suppose to pay £17 a month and I ended up paying £27. It's all in the chat logs that I saved. And every time they agree it has to be fixed but they don't fix it.Update: June 2020. I've been contacted by a complaint team and they provided a solution that is acceptable. This has been fixed for now but it took me months to fix.",1
"Overall my experience with Vodafone has been pretty good. The service is great, and the prices aren’t too bad.However when it comes to telephone customer service, there is much to be improved upon. For instance I phoned up to enquire about why I had additional charges on my bill and the person I spoke too could barely understand let alone speak English... honestly. Some staff who are not completely clueless and actually understand what is being said would be a great addition.",1
"After reading some reviews about Vodafone I thought I would share my experience with you.I have been with vodafone mobile for 15 + years as they are one of the best in my area all thou I have had signal issues over the most of those years even in my house,after lots of calls to vf over the years they supplied me with a sure signal box free of charge and that made my phone calls from home better,still have issues from time to time around my local area.How ever after years of being with EE broadband I decided to try vf as they was doing a decent deal.Set up was pretty easy and all went well to start with then ,things started to change after a few months the broadband speed and connectivity was good but wifi issues started accruing wifi keeps dropping and it will not reach my garden,(never had any issues with EE ). I have phoned vf many times about it and all though the staff are very helpful  it is some time a nightmare to get hold of,they have talked me through a few changes to my settings to try and sort thinks out and they seem to work for so long and then back to drop wifi issues and sometimes I have to re-enter my pass word to reconnect on numerous occasions it keeps telling me I have entered my password wrong, sometimes I have to enter two or three time before it excepts the code,the last time I spoke to vf they advised me they they don't guarantee wifi signal which was a bit of a blow as I have never had any problems with EE. Roll on to the end of my broadband contract with vf so I can try someone else.If I get a reply from vf team please do not ask me to contact them on social Media as I do not use any of these platforms.",1
"Contemplated between 3 and 4 stars and would like to explain. Originally myself &hubby took out mobile + internet for 18 months which ended in Feb 2020 and they did't contact us to discuss extension. Original set up of broadband and billing was a nightmare (what was agreed vs what was billed) and some friends had same experience, but sorted our eventually but ONE GREAT thing was that for 20 months we didn't receive silly post every 6 months stating our bill will go up by 10% (as it was with horrific Virgin Media). ONE BAD thing is that my husband doesn't have work phone and had to use his phone for work in March (during pandemic) forgetting he had 500 minutes/month in phone calls he never came close to using! One day he receives a warning text saying he exceeded his normal £10/month bill by £90!!! After some persuasion (and calls) they reduced the bill by £50. This unfortunate experience brings us to ANOTHER GOOD THING is their customer service who were working from home (disjointed broadband and mobile departments) after a long call managed to pull it together and get us a renewed contract for further 18 months at a bargain price (broadband + mobile). TalkTalk and NowTV have problems with answering to customers and don't have people working from home it seems! THIRD GOOD THING is that we got my 91-year old father-in-law a SIM ONLY (UK only) unlimited minutes on his mobile for only £8/month. The cheapest deal and perfect to know the price is fixed! GOOD overall, but need some improvement on initial account set-up and more collaboration between mobile/broadband departments.",1
"Their phone service in terms of signal and 4G reception is very good.Their business retention model is awful however. My contract came to an end and I tried to negotiate one of the packages they offer through third party agents but was told that I couldn’t do so and only got offered their standard packages with a 15% discount.I turned them down and asked for my PAC number so that I could take my number elsewhere. That part went smoothly.I signed up to Asda on a 30 day SIM only deal that was much cheaper and provided much more data with the same service, home or abroad as offered by Vodafone - but for £5.00 a month cheaper than Vodafone’s best discounted offer to me.I considered trying their cheaper sister company VOXI but the reviews were off putting, especially if you were porting a number. I also cannot understand how VOXI can provide a roaming service abroad, but Vodafone basics doesn’t. Work that one out - they are fundamentally the same company after all.To summarise; I got more data, the same call and text limit - international roaming etc, plus an efficient UK based Call Centre, all for £5.00 a month less than Vodafone’s best bespoke deal  - with a 30 day contract and even kept my mobile number.",1
"They're alright.Seem to have one of the mobile best networks in the UK - can get decent signal even in the middle of nowhere. But their prices are simply more expensive than their competitors, you only get a decent deal when you threaten to leave, and even the guy that was meant to try and convince me to stay agreed and owned up to also having a contract with the provider I was switching to.Their support isn't great, but it's no worse than their competitors.",1
"Decent customer service, one person did straight up lie to me, but other department were very good at keeping up communication.Service itself is subpar, found far more consistency with o2, but still the service has been much better than EE at least in my experience in the UK. Prices don't help this out any.",1
"As a family we have had mobile accounts with Vodafone for many years.  We spend a great deal of time in Turkey and the fact that the country was on Vodafone's 'roam free' list (and no other UK provider does this) was the principle reason we had been loyal to them.  So when they announced in March that they would be removing Turkey from the list it came as a bit of a shock.  A quick calculation showed that it was going to cost me up to £1500 a year to stay connected when abroad.  I rang Customer Service in disgust, adamant to let them know how cross I was, before moving all my accounts.  The gentleman was very calm and understanding.  He said that because I was a 'long standing' customer they could place all my phones onto some form of 'special account' that meant I could keep the free roaming in Turkey.  Oh here we go, I thought, he's trying to sell me a bolt on.In fact it's actually worked out cheaper than before!  Why they couldn't have just done that automatically without me having to get enraged I don't really know.",1
"I have been with Vodafone for 8 years but I am now moving to another mobile network.My experience with Vodafone has actually been quite good. I have no major complaints.I would say that the monthly phone contracts on Vodafone with a handset are slightly dearer than other networks. However, the RED bundle is great value for money as it comes with a choice of various entertainment packs (Sky Sports, Spotify, etc).I was also given a substantial discount on my current contract which I would not have been able to afford otherwise. I felt extremely valued as a customer who had been with them for so long. Unfortunately, I do not believe they offer this kind of discount anymore.The mobile phone coverage has never let me down. As I have no first-hand experience with any other network, I am unable to give a direct comparison. But e.g. at concerts, my friends' would often be unable to get 4G but I never found myself in that situation. Extremely reliable from my experience.However, the only minor annoyance when I was told that I should wait until or around the date of my termination to transfer my number over to another network, otherwise I may get charged an early termination fee (ETF). I was told this around 3 weeks before my contract came to an end. I had my eye on an extremely good mobile phone deal at the time but I did not want to risk having to pay the ETF so I waited. Unfortunately, the deal quickly disappeared. I called Vodafone again 2 weeks later only to find out that whoever had informed me about the ETF was wrong and that I would be okay if I transferred my number at any point as I had already paid all that was due.A slightly disappointing end.",1
Last night I received my PAC code from Vodafone and they said if I stick with Vodafone I can get up to 30% off and gave me a link to chat. I clicked to chat and went through security then I was told that I needed to speak to another department so I was passed on immediately and spoke to someone else after going through security again I discussed the offer I had off sky mobile and the discount from Vodafone so we discussed that and I was told I needed to speak to another department and could take up to 20 minutes to get through. 35 minutes later I finally got to talk to somebody. She told me the best she could offer was £49 per month (despite speaking to of of their partner companies earlier in the day and I was given £43). After a lengthy discussion and being told she couldn’t do any better she said that there is another department who can possibly give be a better offer. This was 2 HOURS after I started speaking with them. I was not happy but eventually I agreed to speak to the other department. The 4th person I spoke to was called Rachel and within a few minutes after going through security for a 4th time and over 2 hours of chatting with them I was given the following offer:iPhone 1124g dataUnlimited callsUnlimited texts12 months insuranceCan upgrade after 12 months1 year subscription to apply TV£42 per monthTWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER I ended the chat after speaking with 4 different people. I got a decent offer but it should not have taken that amount of time!,1
Terrible customer care unless you speak to a human. I tried to cancel my contract but took nearly an hour on the 'chat' service and they were useless - I got nowhere. So I tried to get hold of someone human and she was great. It was concluded quickly.So my tip - speak to a human.,1
"Disappointing! As a long-term customer Vodafone mobile there was little incentive to get broadband with them. The offer was not attractive including having to lose my  landline telephone number and hanging around for an engineer to call. TalkTalk could just do it directly, so I would be able to keep my landline number and would have no need for an engineer to call round.",1
Disgusting service. They eventually admit they made a mistake which has marked my credit file and have spend the last 12 months chasing them to fix it and pay the compensation they promised. Now I have just been told since my account is closed I cannot be given any compensation at all. What a joke they were happy to send my information to a debt collector twice and not even attempt a call to me when their mistake made them think I owed them! Not so quick to cough money up when it’s the other way round. They’ll happily take your hard earned money with any excuse but put barriers up when giving it back. Hypocrites-- Update --I forgot all about this but it did eventually get sorted once through to a complaints staff member based here in the UK. This team seemed a lot more willing to help and a lot less shrouded in processes. took them two 15 minute calls to sort and then confirm they had corrected my credit file. so I've updated my score a little to reflect the good staff that they do have. I suspect its more a case of process being crap rather that the people,1
"I have had a Vodafone mobile contract for years and years and my package works well for me (sim only).Staff at my local shop our helpful and pleasant.Where it all goes wrong is in customer services and accounts.Talking to someone in India is potluck if they understand your issues with phone and/or account.I was tricked into automatic payments when they asked on line if I wanted my card details to be saved. I asked for that to be undone, but to no avail. Then I got a message this month that my bill was not paid, although on the bill it states that it will be taken from my account. Totally crap and annoying.",1
"Positives:Good 4G speed & respectable roaming countries (not as many as 3 but better than the other networks)Good PAYG rewardsNegatives:Customer service is never in sync, they don’t seem to log the important parts of a call so you always have to explain the issue all over again to another person!Indoor service is hit and miss",1
"Been with Vodafone 12m, leaving as they are increasing the tariff inside the 18 month contract I originally took out. It's not a big price increase but the service has dropped dramatically in the last 4 months and there are much better offers out there at the moment. We stream Netflix and have our mobile phones connected to the wifi for the baby monitor, no gaming etc so nothing really hammering the resource.Netflix (via amazon firetv) repeatedly cuts out/freezes/disconnects and when it does come back on, can be painfully slow to reload and results in a very pixelated picture. The signal has also seemed to decrease in range - cuts out in rooms where it was fine.Wifi on the mobile phone can cut out throughout the day and also the TV so it's not an evening/heavy use period problem.Customer service (via chat) on the occasion I did contact them were relatively helpful. I've generally had no issues up until the service getting so much worse. Quite glad to have the tariff increase to release me from my contract!",1
"My experience with Vodafone Customer Service both in the UK and off-shore was poor. From scaremongering tactics regarding the life of handsets to a very uncaring attitude towards a loyal customer of many years.All that changed when I contacted the CEO of Vodafone, Nick Jeffrey, whose email address is easily obtainable on-line. The matter was handled really well by Caleb Schofield of their Executive Team. He actually cared about customer retention and went above and beyond.You shouldn’t have to go to those lengths but clearly it works.",1
"I have Vodafone broadband, phone, mobile, ipad... that is it!  They usually deliver good service.  Their customer care is a sad, sad case though! Barely any indoor signal, yet they argue with me that miles away on a little computer they see I should have good phone signal...not gotten through to them as yet",1
(Irish Customer) (POSTED HERE DUE TO NO REPLIES FROM IRISH BRANCH) Paying 55 euro a month for 250 gb mobile broadband and over the last few months speeds have been dropping like crazy up until a few days ago the network was just about usable. Now im getting speeds as low as 0.09 mbps. And ive reported it to support every other day and im told your problem is being forwarded to out technical team. And there has still been no improvement. Reason for the 3 stars is due to there being the odd 2 or 3 support workers that were genuinely nice and tried to help as best they could. Which is a lot better than i can say for the rest. Service needs to be improved in areas where 4G may not be so easily accesible and customer support needs a complete re-do. (WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD REPLY VIA E-MAIL ETC...) And thank you for your time.,1
"I like Vodafone for some points and I hate Vodafone for other points. About over month ago I was disconnected ( few min after I paid my bill, and I have 4 items so pay a lots ). All day I was calling 191 and been promised that they will connect me back in 2 hours in 15 minutes. Non of agent was helpful. They said technical problem . Next day all the same I called 191 over 10 times and nothing happened. Eventually I upgraded me plan what make me connect again so I done myself as they was to stupid to doit. They give some compensation apologies for being useless and unhelpful. Anyway 2 weeks ago I placed order for iPhone 11 and iwatch 5. Day after I desited to cancel order iPhone but keep watch and change watch from trade in offer just to normal without giving my old watch back. Women on the phone, well not just her because I called few times as I did not received any email confirmation, so they all guaranteed that iPhone 11 order is cancel and watch will not have to be trade in. I was shocked when week later iphone 11 arrived and week later watch with envelope for old watch to trade in. So all upside down. When I called man on the phone was yawn and can’t help. Anyway I think Vodafone are ok but all these agents from 191 are pathetic lier and don’t know the job. I rather go to shop then talk with these horrible agents. Even while they talk they not put interest or any attention and do everything wrong . How bad customer service how agent ca yawn or other was eating I can clearly hear . Is so bad .",1
"They falsely advertise their broadband speeds, speeds might be 15-40mbps although they advertise 55 minimum guaranteed. Their money back guarantee is only a discount of 15%.They can’t even keep their paperwork in check, I spent half day calling them going to Vodafone centre to prove that my contract says that I can cancel 30 days after my installation. Still don’t get it why I had to prove them that because they should have a copy of my contract.Long story short their broadband is **** their customers support is even worse and they can’t even get their paper work in check.Edit:ill bump it up to 3 stars because of  their Directors office response to my online complain, where they understood what was the issue and that it was an unusual case due to my contract setup date and instillation date being unusually far apart in which time they changed their return policy",1
"I had to wait almost 40 minutes on the phone for just a simple enquiry ,but they did eventually sort things out. I just think they need more people manning the phone lines!",1
As long as you don’t have a problem Vodafone is a great network. If you have a problem it will take ages to get through which is seriously annoying. Then you either get a fantastic PERSON or someone who doesn’t have a clue or gives darn who or what you want.,1
"I've had a decent experience from their supply of coverage, but when coming to upgrade their costs are just far too high in comparison to others. Should value their existing customers more than simply trying to bring in new ones.",1
"So I have two mobile phone contracts and a home broadband contract with Vodafone and I'll start with the first mobile.Mobile 1 for my son was due an upgrade so we called to see what could be offered as I spend quite a bit with vodafone. No offer of discount was forthcoming to match EE prices so we took out a contract with EE, there was a little more time on the vodafone contract to run which I was happy to sacrifice when moving over.  Note: corporately I can get 20% with EE (previously my employer was with vodafone and they too gave 20%) but I've been a loyal customer for more years than I can remember so have stayed with them.I recently called to give the 30 day notice to cancel the contract foe mobile 1 and there was the retrospective offer from the cancellations team oops too late for that now new contracts signed and out of cool off period .Over to mobile 2, I see you have another phone, do you want to upgrade? I'm not quite due one yet, that's ok said the operator we can sort that out for you. A variety of plans were mentioned and then the unlimited plan along with a 20% discount was offered which was very interesting indeed.  I gratefully took this offer up.I'm now two weeks later and the whole area that i live in has home broadband connection problems.This is not normally an issue as I would tether from my mobile. This is where what I thought was a fantastic deal, was far from it. My mobile speeds have dropped at least 30mbs making working from home ridiculously difficult. After being on the phone for the faults relating to the home broadband I then spoke to the customer service team to discuss hope they can rectify the speeds, 3 teams later and my options are1. Upgrade to the max unlimited plan, current discount will not be applied2.  downgrade my plan to what I previously had, this has a discount applied and will be retained. No mention of returning handsetor3.  return my handset and go back to my old contract.I will be returning my handset and when the appropriate time comes along will be cancelling all my contracts with Vodafone.I'm not asking for much  just a reasonable speed on a phone contact that I still pay quite a sum for. Returning the phone will also mean I have a branded, new case that is of no use to me, for now.So a phone call that took more than 40 minutes to a customer services teams, with no willingness to retain a customer, is 40 minutes I'll never get back and Vodafone has lost another customer. Whether this is a result of their systems being inflexible or  the people being inflexible I'll never know.23rd July updateI went in my lunch break to The Lock, Swindon with the intent on handing back my phone, the assistant listened to my experience over the weekend with Vodaphones customer service teams and to cut a long story short, with authorisation from the regional manager, I retained my original 20% discount and my speed upgraded.  So credit goes to the assistant that actually listened to me, sorry I do not know his name but thank you very much. The team over the phones really should take a leaf out of his book on how to treat loyal customers. If I could give an independent score for the assistant in Swindon he would look get a 5 star rating.",1
Phoned to enquire about changing to another provider once this contract ran out as they had better offer. Agent said he could give me a quote to see if I would stay. Okay and he quoted me a deal on the phone I wanted for 45 a month. More then the other provider but close enough I said ok for loyalty sake. Within 20 minutes I got confirmation email saying phone works be sent out for contract at 53 a month. Phoned to point out the mistake to be told the agent gave me the wrong price. They checked the phone call and yes I had been quoted 45.... Got put through to numerous different teams with each time the story well get it sorted... Almost 2 hours later.... No we won't honour the quote...I shall take business elsewhere...Update - The complaint team phoned me back and a very nice man offered his sincere apologies for what he could understand was not great customer service....very nice man as said....then he suggested he put me  through to their resolution team to see what offer they could make on back of this experience....ok.....waited in queue to then get a person quote me exact same price i was complaining about....give them their due...they stick to their guns and will not budge an inch ...i'll go elsewhere where cheaper offers from Vodafone abound for 3rd party suppliers...but not for 'valued' customersUpdate  - ok got a phone call from another sales team person.... Apparently not connected to my above gripe.... Anyway he offered me a much better offer on a new phone... Not quite what was offered before but very near... Person was very polite ... To be honest they have all been very polite... So I have accepted and updated my stars to reflect my restoration in customer service given.....Update...after a few months i looked at the details of my package on phone app....turns out the packaged offered by above was not what i was given....yet again they lied about what they could offer...Update - Eventually got through to someone who listened to my story and fixed there and then....updated my account to what was initially offered and added a discount for my troubles....if only all experiences were like this.....from sound of it call was offshore (i guess India??) but the lady was top notch and so helpful...so i update stars to 3......shame it took so many attempts to get someone who bothered to take the time to help and knew what they were doing....which other staff  clearly didnt.,1
If you have a problem with Vodafone Broadband or mobile and you mention it here it looks like you have to be on Twitter or Facebook to get an answer from Vodafone. I'm not on those two platforms and I have no interest in signing up to get what probably won't be an answer to a problemUpdate:Hey yourselfIt would be nice if you could mention some of the more old fashioned ways to contact you going forward. (in the future),1
"I had broadband with vodafone for a couple of months. Then I was moving out so we used the transfer of ownership. Apparently, we had to fill in the form a couple of time, give them multiple phone calls, and even then they charged both of us. After that, they told me that the money is now on the vodafone acount, so that's all sorted. But I could not get it back. I had to wait another month. After many chat online, phone calls, around 5 redirections, I finally now was told that I will get my money back by the end of the next week. Just imagine.EDIT: I've updated to 3 stars to reflect the stability of the internet when I lived there. The internet was always meeting its minimum of 52mb.",1
"Unfortunately I just changed Broadband and phone provider to this company. The Broadband switch website reviews were quite positive, so stupidly I ignored Trustpilot. Thought I was going with a quality reputable brand - my god I wish I'd stayed with BT no issues there. Wifi is SLOW, their router/modem poor, I can't link up my TP Link powerlines and can't use my TP link fast modem/router - they will not let you use a third party router/modem - despite telling me you could pre purchase and a couple of 'technical support' giving details of how to setup. Their lamentable support stops at 9pm and is based in Egypt (which is fair enough if it was actually open). Basically a totally incompetent provider.I have updated this from 1 star to 3. Having put in two complaints and posted on here they got in touch at work to resolve. However today I just phoned TP Link  who were brilliant in terms of setting up the router. On the Vodafone box things did improve a little but it is poor quality, I could not get our TV's or TP Link to access it at all and the signal was weak / less than poor.I understand the approach of not supporting a third party router - its pretty obvious ship instructions for third party routers if a customer opts for them - even if they need to setup with router company. They should have 24/7 support in day and age and make sure their staff actually are trained on the product/options.",1
"I went into shop asking for a simple payasugo sim, the saleasman said I could have one for free, he then added a contract to my account for over £21 a month, I have lost count of the diferent deparments I have been passed too, they promised to cancel it, but I still get bills, I will stick to a simple payasgo infuture and would not sign up with vodaphone again, the lied to tie me into a contract I never ordered and nothing but aggrevation trying to get out of itupdate after reply, complaint has been resolved, I did not sign anything though, but thanks for reply, had been happy with Vodaphone up until then",1
I would like to update my review. Since writing my review and spending over an hour speaking to the sales manager and writing a letter and HAVING TO MAIL IT THROUGH THE POST CERTIFIED I received a call from Vodafone and I think the problems have been solved. it was a nightmare but hopefully thanks to the amazing Sales Manager things should be good now.Thank you!!!!,1
"Generally if you call other mobiles in UK within the bundle is cheap ( like I pay10 GBP for 250 min a month + unlimited text and 2 GB data).if you want to call a landline or a line that starts with 02 then they start charge you additional and is not part of the minutes you already paid for. the charge for that call is very high and if you got additional credit like 5 or 10 pounds in your account you can make barely one call as they charge over half pound per min for such calls which is absolutely ridiculous, more importantly, they don't tell you that these calls are not covered by your monthly bundle.However there are solution to that , unfortunately not through Vodafone, I bought JustVoip and through that you can make free calls to number that starts with 02there coverage here in Medway is gooddata speed is good as wellroaming in Europe is very good as its considered as moving in UK",1
"Fairly new customer, had some bad experiences with o2 and 3, so hopeful Vodafone will prove better. Feel it was a bit rogue to hide my line rental, when I was led to believe I would be paying £20 a month all in. Suppose all companies are out for your money, perhaps they will prove to be the best of a bad lot.",1
Really difficult to engage with from a rural location. However once you get through to the right person it's an okay service. They wont use email which is a big down point,1
"One of the best UK providers, been with them over  6 years and have had good experience except when it came to upgrades and price matching its contenders. Today as I write this my number is being ported over to O2 because nobody at Vodafone retentions wanted me or three of my other family members to stay with them. Not saying they did not try to retain us, they tried really poorly.After 6 long years leaving on a bad note is probably thier only negative. Their customer service is ace and beats anyone else out there. Stick to it if you can find pocket friendly options. Service for data and call quality are way better than other providers too.But once again loyalty with them DOES NOT PAY so be prepared.",1
Good:Network works fine.Price for the whole contract.Bad:Technical customer service was poor.Not able to set spending cap on app.Useless additional services switched on by default.,1
"TBH i have been a loyal VF customer for many years but i see none of that loyalty reflected back? I do see new customers getting much better deals than me, which really grates on me and makes it feel VF are taking me for granted...do not!.I am due a 'scheduled' upgrade right now but the deals are in no way rewarding, small data offers show little respect for my prolonged loyalty. My actual contract expire in 10 weeks, it is likely i am  leaving VF and i have already requested my unlock code. Give me a Huawei P20 lite (Blue), 1gb data and whatever mins and texts for a 'valued and well  deserved' loyal customer price p/m.Now balance is mitigated but here it is, to be fair, respect where it's due, coverage has never ever been a concern and having lived in a small village, only VF worked out there, so well done VF.I have encountered staff/service difficulties in-store relating to setting up my partners new VF contract phone, costing us 4 visits to the city centre store to finally have it resolved.Make me feel respected and valued VF?",1
"I'd been with Vodafone as a PAYG customer for many years and wanted a SIM only monthly contract.  Despite Vodafone's best efforts and mine they couldn't match one from Virgin so I asked for a PUC and switched.  Because I was in credit when I left Vodafone I asked for a refund after switching. I went through various levels of Customer Service only to be told it wasn't possible, often for a different reason each time.I'm a great believer in Trustpilot so I initially left a damning review on here.Within a day I was contacted by them and through social media messaging and a few phone calls, a refund was agreed and made.I'm a fair man and give both credit and criticism when due.  Vodafone got it wrong in the first place, but through tenacity and determination, common sense prevailed and Vodafone got it right in the end.",1
"One star is too generous.What an absolute shambles of a company.Called up on the 10th Aug to cancel my existing contract.  Member of the cancellations team enquired as to why I was cancelling - explained I wanted the Note 9 - they offere to do a flexi upgrade on my account and for £79 upfront I'd more or less be on the same contract.  A little bit more expensive a month but yes ok fine.  As a pre-oder bonus I would also receive the handset on the 17th Aug, a week ahead of the official release date.  Great.  I get a confirmatory text explaining these details and the specifics on the new contract and date of delivery.No email comes through and during the week I get in touch through vodafone live chat on no less than four occasions to enquire why my order number isnt coming up on their tracking system.I'm told that pre-orders dont work on the tracking system.I'm told that not to worry sir we can assure you the phone will be delivered on the 17th.  You will get  DPD tracking number. Some examples below:You : ok no problems - just to confirm the delivery date?Sunil : The deliver date 17/Aug/2018Radhika : Thanks a lot for waiting.I have checked the details for you and i can see that you have upgraded your order with the SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 9 - 128GB - OCEAN BLUEHowever, as this is pre-ordering will get the handset 1 week before release date which is 24th August 2018, Delivery will be made to your home address on the 17th August 2018Radhika : DPD will message you beforehand with a time slot and will be delivered in the times of 8AM - 6PM.No phone came, better yet - after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes I'm told that no-one knows anything about this pre-order bonus.The vodafone representative acknowledges this and refers me to Complaints.  I call the complaints number and I just dont understand what the functionality of that department is.  They offered no explantion, reason or any kind of remuneration for the mis-selling of this 'offer'.I then called 191 about cancelling my order.  I'm told that I cannot cancel the order as its still 'open'.  I now need to wait until next week to receive the phone (despite it not being dispatched yet) before I can cancel.I am lost for words.An absolute shambles.Update - after contacting the social media team I called 191 to ensure my preorder was in fact cancelled. I spoke with a very helpful chap called Colin who was sympathetic with the situation. He was able to get me a great deal on the phone.  I have updated the rating to 3 stars as at the end of the day I was mis sold, but looking at the average rating I'm clearly not alone with my experience.",1
"We've had mixed experiences with Vodafone. We had a £200 bill rack up on a completed contract and the first time we heard of it was when a debt collector contacted us. Eventually, with alot of investigation Vodafone end they put it down to an Admin error. That aside, when we have had the need to contact them we have had quick service.My advice is use them wisely, if there's a good deal going then snap it up, just make sure your contracts are ""CLOSED"" at the Vodafone end.",1
"Vodafone are great when you are paying them for a contract, but as soon as you ask for something in return, it's no.  I am going away for a year working where I cannot use my contract, so will be paying for it at £24 a month but not using any of the features.Basically vodafone will be getting this money and I won't be using anything in return.  I understand that I have to pay for the phone, and accept this, but I thought they might give me a reduction on my monthly payment as I won't be using any data, minutes or texts.  I need to take my phone to use with a tourist SIM card.",1
"I signed up to a Vodafone plan through mobiles.co.uk because of a cashback offer on a high data allowance. My company also offers an employee discount on 12-mo Vodafone contracts. So I decided to give it a go.Vodafone have the best network in the UK. The Ofcom network coverage maps demonstrate it pretty well, and I did my own independent testing, and Vodafone came out on top in every place I've visited - 79% any coverage during my regular commute. I get fast speeds and general reliability is more stable than O2 and far superior to 3.There are many issues with Vodafone though:1. Some settings simply cannot be changed without getting in touch with customer service. For example, voicemail was completely inaccessible for months and only by ""resetting"" the voicemail was it resolved (not sure why it was not setup correctly in the first place, perhaps as I transferred numbers). Other settings also just show errors when trying to change them such as the age restriction bar.2. When changing limits and settings on the website or app, sometimes it ends up changing other settings unintentionally back to their defaults, or, the setting you actually changed reverts back (as if it never applied in the first place).3. Sometimes when trying to access the website just to get my bills, I'd just get an error saying come back later, which happened for a month - whereas the app was able to make changes without issue.4. If you sign up for a new contract with Vodafone with a new SIM card, even if your old contract has already ended, it takes 30 days to transfer your phone number to the new contract. Whereas moving the number to another provider would have taken at most a couple of days. I've managed to get it down to 7 days through threatening to leave, but this is still unacceptable.5. I previously wanted to leave shortly after my first contract ended, and I asked for my PAC code, and received comms about it many times, but never actually received the code. My online account was also unintentionally deleted so could no longer get to my bills or see my plan.6. When I cancelled a retention plan, the comms said I had to return my phone. The phone that I had actually bought myself and was not part of the contract. This is very misleading and other users could end up believing this.7. My experience of in-store staff is mixed - sometimes they were attentive and sometimes not. Though I don't blame this on the company per se.Overall, I'm very pleased with the coverage and data speed, on the fence about price changes, and not happy about customer service. I would be hesitant to recommend.",1
"Love the chat feature much easier than calling and listening to hold music constantly.Been with Vodafone for 20 + years and there ""deals"" are no where near as competitive as the new providers.  All they want to do is SELL you more- more date more talk time and every year I call about my contract I ask the same question - what is my ACTUAL usage. I don't want to pay OVER my requirements and with most places with free WIFI and whatsapp who needs huge data packages unless it's for businesses?  My contract gets agreed with a price and no sooner this happens and ""additional % cost"" gets added a few months later - do they think we won't notice.Just wish they'd stop selling my details onto 3rd parties.",1
"I have had a few problems with Vodafone from delivery problems and connection which was frustrating but i have to say how ever annoyed or anary i was going onto a phone call to customer service I found it very hard to remain angry as the level of help and professionalism from the sales, retentions and complaints team was extraordinary they are a credit to the company and I don't think vodafone would be operatingreat without them",1
"Be careful with the Europe global roaming. This allows you to use your bundle minutes and texts while in Europe, so you could call the UK from France or send texts to the UK from France. However, if you send a text to France from the UK, you will be charged international rate! Even if you take on the option of international saver for an extra £3 or £5 a month, you can then call from the UK to Europe but you will still be charged international rate for sending a text to Europe.... Pretty unfair considering that texts are a lot cheaper to handle than call for the mobile operator.",1
"I have broadband - they're too expensive for mobile plans and would never use a landline. The broadband is good enough for the £21 that I'm paying. I am not sure of its reach, as, in a two bedroom flat, it loses connection in one of the bedrooms - only two walls between the router and room. Very weird. But through only one wall (to the other bedroom), my laptop is well-connected to the WiFi. My phone loses connection sometimes. It's a weird signal, I guess. Their customer service was fine with me, had to talk to them quite a bit to ensure that everything runs smoothly before deciding to take the package. Then when it should've gone live - it didn't, so I phoned them. A fine solution, it was because of my plug in the wall - oh well. But they're good for broadband. Good enough. I've never actually had fast and well-working WiFi, not with Sky (and they have terrible customer service), not with EE, nor with TalkTalk. So I guess Vodafone is good enough.",1
"Could be better. Can't fault the signal and strength of the network. Never had any problems. Been with them for at least 10 years now and trying to get a better deal out of them come upgrade time is like trying to squeeze blood out of a stone. Very reluctant. Unless you tell them you're going to leave instead. Then you might get a slightly better deal. And the range of handsets on offer is very very poor. If you want something other than a Samsung or an Apple, no chance.I went to Carphone Warehouse as I wanted the Google Pixel 2 but had nothing but problems with them. Fair play to Vodafone who have advised me and helped me deal with CW's mess up.",1
Extremely long waits for customer service 40 minutes +0.3 Mbps speed on my Superfast 2 broadband which was guaranteed to be 55MbpsConnected directly to master socket with LAN connection to router.My internet was faster than this 15 years ago!Edit March 2021: Increased star rating as internet speeds have been reliably fast (50Mbps) for well over a year.,1
"This is one of worst singnal in my location. They give 1.4GB per day but we can't use it full. They are smartly remove our signal and save their money. If we was call cus.care they said your connection is good then clear your searched files from your website. This is too waste. I got more angry but what will I do against them, they consider me as a 10 to 11 people only.....",1
"When the 4g wi-fi network is good it's really good however when it's bad and you can't  get online, complaining to vodafone gets you an extra 250mg of data allowance to use in seven days BUT you can't use it because you have no network connection - thanks for nothing vodafone",1
"Leaving after 3 years - all down to lack of communication. I have a sim only contract which is due to expire next month. I called up this week to renew it for another 12 months and was told I’d be on the exact same contract. Happy enough, I went online straight away to apply my EA discount (30%) only to find it was showing as 15%. Called them back to query this and was told that recent changes have seen the discount cut in half. Why wasn’t I told this to begin with? Tried to haggle with them however they point blank refused to budge on a £17 a month deal (for which I’m currently paying £14). Only a couple of quid a month I know, but why would I want to pay more than what I currently am, especially when I only use about half of my monthly data allowance?!Anyway I asked for my current tariff to be reinstated and gave 30 days notice of leaving them. Got on the blower to EE who offered me the EXACT same deal for £13 a month. No brainier...Vodafone called me back a few days later asking why I was leaving. They then offered me the same deal I’d declined just a few days prior, despite me telling them about EE’s superior offer. No thanks!As if that wasn’t enough, they text me this morning telling me about changes to the EA discount applicable from 4th February... erm hello it’s now 18th February! Perhaps if they’d sent this out earlier then we would’ve avoided this debacle and I may have considered paying the extra.This isn’t the first time Voda have messed me about. I took out broadband and home phone with them 2 years ago, only to be fobbed off and charged more than they promised! Promptly cancelled and took my business elsewhere... EE to the rescue again!",1
"As a mobile phone company they are about as good as it gets (which isn't too marvelous anyway) and their broadband works where Talktalk failed miserably. However... when renewing my contract I was offered free NowTv. It seems though that to use this I need to enter my payment details and then remember to cancel my 'subscription' in 12 months. This is an old technique used to rip people off (Brittania music anyone?). Not impressed at all. Shape up Vodafone! This is sneaky, underhand and not how I expect to be treated as a customer.",1
I've given up trying to solve my problem. They owe me just over £20 due to billing issues and after ringing up several times over the last two months I've lost the will and not going to bother.The call centre staff are friendly but have no knowledge or power to solve anything.EDIT: After seeing this post I was contacted by a UK customer support office who had a lot more technical knowledge than the usual call centre staff and solved the refund instantly.,1
Trying to end my contact by phone. Always busy. At lest 40 minute wait. Still unable to get through. Will have to spend an afternoon waiting in the shop at this rate. Poor customer service. Extortionate contracts that never remain the same.,1
I have had many issues with Vodafone over the past year. However my credit check passed successfully with them and not with other providers so I thought I'd go ahead as at least I have a new phone! With this contract I won't be paying by Direct Debit. Instead I will do it manually to ensure that the bills are correct and to ensure that no overcharged amounts are taken from my bank. I agree with the reviews here on Trustpilot and personally I wouldn't have chosen Vodafone a second time. However at least I have a new phone out of it! So I can't really grumble...,1
"It took time to sort out the broadband before it actially worked (days). Part of the problem was the lack of technical knowledge at the call centre and an inability to do anything but follow the computer screen prompts at their end. The gentleman that solved the problem was great but even he was annoyed with the mess.Re the free gift.... the marketing company should be sacked and never used again. There are problems in getting in contact with them as there are a lot of unhappy customers without gifts, in particular a speaker that has now lost a quarter of its value before I've got it. Added to that an inability to communicate the correct information to me I now feel the whole gift thing was a big con.If Vodafone is offering the best deal for you then great. Any gift offered is a bonus if it arrives.",1
"Spoke to agent on live chat reference upgrading my phone, I asked for a good deal as I have been a customer for shy of 10 years.  After minutes of hagling with the agent, a deal was struck, was I happy with it... sure.Order was put through and chat ended.I decided to check Vodafones web page to see how much I'd saved......LOL the same special offer given to me was staring me in the face, apart from the upfront cost of £30. So no special offer for a long serving customer,  I guess my loyalty wasn't really of interest to the agent. Thanks a bunch.",1
"After lots of haggling and lots of misinformation from the call centres in Egypt, they did put me through to someone in the UK and they have given me the best deal I could find, so in that respect i'm very happy. £22 for 40Gb data unlimited txts and mins as well as spotify premium is very reasonable. However getting anything else sorted is an absolute nightmare. My mother switched the account into my name when I was 18, that was 6 years ago now and they are still billing her £4.17 every month for 6 years, on her credit file. But when they search her on the system there is no account in existence with her name to it. it's an absolute joke. So she can't even pay this supposed fee. There call centre staff just have no idea. Therefore I would suggest avoiding vodafone their billing system is an absolute mess.",1
"I have been with Vodafone since 2015, all was well until 2 months ago when they started changing me for using my free data, after wasting hours chatting with them they sorted it out. And all was good, until now, for some reason they charged me double for this and next month. I spoke with them again, even went to a store, in the end thay said it was a glitch in the system and that they have fixed it. I am still waiting for my bill to find out. After my contract ends I don't know what I will do, I am disappointed with all the Asian and Indian people I have to talk with who don't even live in England... 3 stars go for the 1 and a half year of no problems",1
been with them for 11 months now and been good but didn't like how they charge to use phone in europe but three dosnt charge at all which i find really good,1
My husband rang  to upgrade my mobile phone contract as  the account is in his name. The first person he spoke made no effort to make a good deal. So my husband ended the call.He rang back 30 minutes later and got a more interested person who managed to find a deal for no upfront charge and over £8 per month cheap.Ring back if you don't get the deal you like is my advice,1
Been a loyal customer for many years - had many bad experiences but today was good. I felt the gentleman I spoke to was very understanding. Guess it's a little bit of luck who picks up the phone!,1
I have been with Vodafone for years. The network coverage is very good but they are quite expensive and when ever I try to call them the service is not that great,1
"I had to go into my local shop in Basingstoke recently. I was met by someone who turned out to be the manager. His attitude stunk. I would have cancelled my contract and gone elsewhere, it was that bad.In the end i spoke to a young man, (think his name was Jo and he was quite new), who took time to listen to me, helped with the problems I was having and restored my faith in the store. He was fantastic.Because of Jo you've retained a customer. If it had been left to the manager, your have lost me and I'd have made sure I spread the word about appalling attitude.",1
"I have used Vodafone for years, always finding their staff helpful.  However, since moving to a new area the reception on my phone has been poor.  It seems more and more these days other networks give better reception.",1
"Been with Vodafone for over 20 years now , had 5 lines with them and although I have had issues ( some pretty ridiculous to be honest ) they have usually managed to sort me out in the end . Recently had problems ending an iPad contract . They disconnected the wrong line despite several contacts webchat and calls to make sure the error was corrected . They then didn't carry out the reconnection process and it took a call to the uk complaint line to get some decent action the operator was very helpful competent and efficient .the line was reconnected in 30 mins with. Thank you for that Vodafone ,please why can't you provide that service all the time .",1
"Tricked into signing up as the salesperson promised me a discount that didn't materialise.Despite providing a transcript of our conversation I still had to jump through a 100 hoops to get the discount, which I now have.I do have an excellent deal and good coverage so I'm happy with vodafone itself but the customer service experience was a nightmare until finally resolved.",1
"Quite expensive, I was in the USA for some weeks and used it, would not fully recommend. Recently I have found there is a distinct drop in coverage, phone shows 4g but doesn’t work, if I find 3G nearby it works better The fact that we can't speak to an anyone directly can make things very difficult at times",1
Didn't have many choices on prepaid phones if they had more prepaid phones then a bigger selection it would be all right Price fir tariff is great. But signal is poor. I only ever have 2 bars or less I don’t like the fact that the price rises during the time of the contract- I’d like to know how this is justified.,1
AT&T is getting shut down for good and being banned from the United States!! No service in Denmark or in Norway and week signal in my area plus the app is difficult to access now Difficulty in accessing internet when out and about.,1
"I don't like there customer care. Very slow to get response.You Guys really need to work on this. Can’t get hold of you Confusing website and “chat” option.  Wrong phone number notification for SIM card, sent twice.  A lot of my time wasted.",1
"Good company but they could do better with their products and pricings. Very poor mobile coverage in many area around the uk. The price is good, but the service range is poor and I can't access the internet using roaming when I am out and about.",1
"Better options available, Verizon much better on all fronts. Poor signal in an area where signal strength is supposed to be strong. When I'm out in Spain it doesn't switch automatically to data. I have to switch the phone off then on to get connected.",1
"They are the only service provider in my area with any signal.  It's pretty expensive & their website needs to be calmed down, but at least they work. Average 4 and 5G very slow Speaking to a person would be much better than live chat",1
For the money we pay for for cable and phone is to much all ATT DO IS SHOW THE SAME BORING OLD ASS MOVIES UPGRADE  WITH THE MOVIES Keeping my informed To many hidden cost that are not mentioned when taking the contract. Bill is always £14/15 pound that’s 40% higher that contract!!!,1
get your rural customers the service they need you cheepscates you don't have to be in the money day one offer package to all Signal  not very good when in the cou try side. I may need to change from ID Mobile because the reception is unreliable at home.,1
"Tried using them for a month. Customer service are not very helpful but phone call clarity was good Not able to speak to anyone,called a few times, says go to website It’s just that I have poor reception from my home with this new provider, only one bar.",1
I see tons of bad reviews but I like my AT&T service... I think it is reasonable for cost and the service is great. Reception out of home is average at best. You need to make it easier to obtain a PAC code.,1
"Good speeds in the Texas area. Currently on U-verse for my home office. They can improve a bit on support though. The contract price is great but the reception on 3 mobile is patchy. I am having problems with the app. I am a returning customer and it hasnt work since I returned, I have deleted and reloaded but still it wont work.",1
Had an better overall experience with t-mobile. Poor app that requires re login every time. better coverage required and less false coverage indicators published. Coverage shows excellent on site but barely one bar in reality.,1
"They help me sometimes. Sometimes not very nice. Good prices though. The billing, charges and app use are fine however the poor connection in our area is the concern. I have no issues in any customer service I have had.Sometimes I can not get any signal which is annoying.",1
Decent experience if you don't call their support team. I dont like that it is difficult to speak to someone if you need help The reception is okayBut to get any help or assistance is virtually IMPOSSIBLE,1
"outrageous prices but... can't beat the service Dont always have network! Great service, info & app but coverage via 3 is rather limited. It often falls particularly when driving when using goigle maps.",1
"Just an averaged company, nothing special. Good price and a good reliable service The 5G coverage appears to be good as it seems to be accessible in a number of places but data drops out consistently",1
The billing is not easy to understand My plan is supposedly £8 month but typically higher as I do use add ins but they are not explained Cheap contract which helps in the current climate. I travel alot with work and can't get connection alot of the time Rarely get a signal and unless I am in a town or city never get internet don’t think I will be staying with ID,1
Very poor internet. Although you get 5G sign on the phone but internet speed is rubbish on so many areas in London You appear to make better offers to new customers - that you never put to existing customers. The network is not good sometimes I can't send message and sometimes voice calls are not proper it cuts off during the conversation.,1
"Sometimes,signal is suddenly out of order, even the phone call, and it happened so many times. I have to restart again and wait for few minutes. Signal coverage poor in some parts, lagging video/film using data Very poor connection. Sometimes when on a call line breaks up or totally disconnects the call.",1
"Price of plans are very good however signal coverage lacks in a lot of areas especially for data even checking the coverage before ordering Great price, but I seem increasingly unable to get a signal when I'm out and about, which is a big nuisance factor. The product is a good one, but the lack of direct customer service ( I.e it is difficult to talk to a real person ) is off putting",1
Very hard to get a costumer addvicer at them end of my contract I will change to a different net work Can't complain about the price or the coverage. It's the customer service that just have no idea which is a shame and laughable. Great price but expect terrible customer service. You get what you pay for.,1
I am unable to access my accout updates on my phone Great valueGreat signalGreat appCustomer service?….. non existent! Positives. Easy to set up and Id keep me informed and I like the rolling data ideaNegatives poor reception at home and outside,1
"Signal is patchy in some built up areas. Other networks have better signal in south Banbury Coverage where I live is very poor despite the map saying it should be good and there is nowhere to report it as a problem Signal coverage isn't great, at times can't make phone calls, no signal coverage",1
"Affordable plansTrouble to signing in my iD Mobile accountResolved now! Great price per month but not a great coverage where I live. Very intermittent and poor signal in my area, so check carefully and do not beleive the signal maps. Impossoble to cancel contract so stuck",1
Good service I just wish that the signal was better noticed it's quite low in most areas that I live. Service seems very intermittent and unreliable. I don't like that you are not able to speak to anyone on the telephone. I had an issue and I was never able to get it resolved.,1
Poor signal at times in areas where I always had full signal Mostly very good however in the Lake District and Yorkshire dales signal is very poor to non existent I dislike the means by which I recover voice messages.,1

Haven't been with you long enough to form an  opinion yet.Going abroad  soon so I'll wait and see how goodyour roaming is.",1
"The mobile connection normally in the mornings is hopeless. For instance when I try to make a phone call it takes several attempts to be connected. A lot of areas where is bad signal or no signal at all I find the signal quite weak at times, it is very frustrating, I am considering changing",1
"For someone who is not familiar with all the terms  used in mobile tech., websites and bills are not easy to understand. Generally very good and competitive. Unhappy that existing customers don’t get same offers as new customers when looking at upgrading phone or plan My daughter arranged my account with you because of value for money .Unfortunately the reception in my house is only one bar on my phone which is poor",1
Improve  the quality  of your network  i have network  but it keeps cutting in and out I don't think it is simple enough for the older person Keeps notifying me of voicemail that does not exist,1
Extremely difficult to get on website. Not sure how to sign in as it never recognises my email address The sim only tariff I'm on used to be a very good deal.Other company's are offering much better deals now. Lousy signal at home CA1 3TW embarrassing.,1
Took a long time for my phone to cross over to the  network from my previous provider ended up pay two monthly bills I like it when you tell me when my service is nearly up but you say check the app but I don’t know where the app is so I can’t check it Lack of service without communicationPoor coverage,1

"No help line using telephone not very good for older customers, so had to go to find a Curry's store to get help with my account ( very helpful ) You guys don’t support eSIM with Apple Watch and this is frustrating as I have Apple Watch that I would like to use without my phone on me. Cant get into my account, you’ve got the wrong number for my phone",1
"Cheap enough but coverage could be better, have to rely on WiFi calling at home even though I don’t live out in the sticks I only get 3g at my home address Price ok but new customers get a better deal and signal not the greatest  looking into moving",1
My only problem with my ID phone provider is not being able to get any network connection when out and about. Everything else is brilliant. I'm not into working for others who's job it is anyway I was without my phone due no network signal for a day could not use the app and got no help using the bot,1
"I have been with this company now for three years, Price is definitely good. The only disadvantage is signal is not the best in certain areas Happy with most things 4g is very poor most of the time Did not have any service last Saturday and Sunday.Very disappointing.",1
Signal is bad in many areas I love the price but my signal for both mobile WiFi and calls has been poorer over recent months. I like the prompts given when using chargeable calls or messages- but not so happy with the internet connections.,1
"Cheap but coverage not great, customer service is poor as you can't speak to anyone, best deals around for contract phones though. I would like to discuss about a new phone but I want to do so with an English speaking person I am disappointed with the lack of coverage by the network which I've not experienced with O2, BT or EE",1
Signal strength changes depending on location. Especially poor in city centre (London) where I spend most of my day working in the office. My phone calls cut out if I move from room to room. WhatsApp phone call never last more than a couple of minutes before I am cut off Signal strength is not what I expected. I seem to be getting a lot of dropped calls and poor signal when out about and wanting to use the internet.,1
Customer very good but 4g coverage in my area is poor Better coverage in parts of Glasgow please. Pros:  no problem its a mobile network.Cons: It's a 5G network but not available on all 5G handsets. My Nokia G50 (5G) phone is not supported.,1
"A good price but the internet is unreliable and at times unable to maintain a video call or even completely unavailable. Struggle with customer support. Unable to access account on the web for about a month with no updates. I sign a new deal for £4:48 per month, within 2 months it went up to £8No read why and no notice given either",1
"Signal not great in parts of London or east anglia. No roaming in Switzerland but does allow roaming in the Isle of Man which why I stick with them! Poor reception and coverage for my area. Phone calls and signal keep dropping off. As of yesterday, I cannot connected to mobile data, have been trying constantly all day today and yesterday, that's why I only give a 3 star rating",1
"Coverage not so good in my area. No apparent upgrade early choice even though I have been sent emails offering upgrades Coverage isn't as good as expected Difficult to get in touch with customer services through the app, takes too long to get a response.",1
"The reception for phone calls in the Denny area where I Iive is very poor causing the calls to keep breaking up. Hi - When I am abroad, I can not make any calls? Is there something I should be doing? Whats app works ok 4G works in some areas and not others - which can be frustrating.",1
"Phone fine, but had problems with account and password some new site adopted Great price but signal isn’t always great . Bought to take away as an extra but often can’t use . iD mobile good....3 network has been appalling in my area over recent weeks!!",1
"Originally set up from catching warehouse in store but can no longer find a face to face shop to assist Convoluted savings plans that rely on people who can't be bothered to jump through the hoops The company is great, but the transfer /upgrade process was difficult",1
Often no connection in busy places even though full signal I joined I’d mobile because of the free roaming. Very good in Europe but I was charged extraordinary amount for my time in the USA. If there is a problem the only point of contact is ask the community and I prefer  to have direct contact either by chat or phone with company,1
"I feel that the iD(Three network) is getting worse in some parts of London.  E.g can’t get signal in London Waterloo station. The phone service (Three) is absolutely terrible. I keep losing calls and getting cut off. I wish I had been informed about this prior to my contract. Not happy with the mid term CPI price increases, Phone signal not too good",1
"Dislike not being able to do MMS on the contract for the price it’s not very good, would expect it on a simm only cotract Not the best coverage, can be hit and miss.  But low cost. I get a lot for my money; however, the service isn't always guaranteed. Reception can be very sketchy and signal strength not great.",1
"Reception not as good as I had. OK but not as good as my last provider. I’m not sure if I can give you my receipt experience as I seldom use the phone as it doesn’t work indoors, James Bevan Although I am relatively happy with ID mobile, I have been using it for a while now but have had no offers to upgrade or get a better deal than my 2gb",1
"Iv only ever got 1 or 2 signal bars making phone conversations hard to understand ont good service. to mach problems. I don't like it. No good with Internet,passwords etc .As long as I don't have a query  or important questionall will be fine.Can still write a letter.",1
"Very bad network in London, it's not possible to use the data in London, sometimes even the phone call don't work Contacted you sat about an issue and was told it would be sorted within 24hrs 4days later not sorted easy to move to this mobile network - deal was in February and despite numerous emails and responses still no sign up deal voucher",1
"Signal is very hit or miss. I ride a motorbike and have to use offline maps most times. Never had this with Vodafone. Not easy to reach live chat, constantly referred to community.i pay id for a service not other users Coverage not as good as I had hoped",1
"Been a customer for a few years, so far experience good, signal not the best in some areas When in France recently I go no network connection, I contacted your chat line and it took over 2 hours to sort the problem out! My only complaint is that the Internet connection is poor. Very bad, to be frank.",1
Had a period when I couldn't log in after you switched off the 3g. Although I was due an upgrade I only did so as I was told the screen was cracked in fact it was the screen saver not the phone. I still have problems pretty much everywhere to download data. It often takes a long time or just won’t do it. I will try for a bit longer for now…,1
It’s okay but my coverage is poor compared to Vodafone. Price is half so you get what you pay for. I want to see if you have a better deal but unable to speak with anyone and other network offers better deals so going to move Dislike being notified of over spend would like warning first,1
"ID are good at Customer Service, costs and offers however the mobile signal is often weak or non existent  in country areas - which is disappointing . Not happy with not having any internet in Mk2 Pinewood Drive area. Internet coverage not great when outdoorsDon't like not being able to talk to customer service agent when I have a problem",1
"Good app, easy to use, problem is they use 3 and the signal is bad and that's the most important part. I hate not able to speak to someone on the phone when you have a problem, or able to ask for some assistance Unfortunately my calls use to drop with 3 mobile, so they do the same with ID also as they piggyback off them",1
"Service seems to go to non existent during rush hours , rest of the time it seems to work fine I have found it impossible to link my 4 ID mobile accounts. so really very frustrating. Often lose signal especially data but sometimes calls too. Tried restarting but no change. Was very frustrating .",1
What can you say. It’s cheap compared to others but coverage hasn’t been great for me. I’m in Essex so this may be area based. Good value for money but network coverage can be patchy (lots of dead areas even in major cities) I like the price of the tariff but I'm not that impressed with coverage quality and data speeds.,1
I hate the fact that it is impossible to speak to anyone there in person...the website is often not the solution to issues I've had. No signal in my area around my house and streets.Need to drive 5 minutes till I get a signal. everything is good apart from the coverage which is a bit pants in the south west,1
My phone reception hasn’t been great since I changed from Three. I constantly get no network available for the phone but 4g ok I struggle to get connections in a lot of places .. when my contract ends I will go back to EE unless it gets better,1
I’ve choose this score because I didn’t realise you have to pay to send photos with this plan I don’t like the fact that I can’t speak to a real person when I’m dealing with ID mobile. I don’t want to chat to somebody in a group chat Plz again try to improve internet it bad try to maybe use vodafone network but tbh I love virgin,1
Poor signal in several places including sometimes in my house We find it difficult to get a signal in most places and a very week signal at home. Instead of giving away free data to people why not reduce our contributions when all said and done your not giving anything your paying customers are.,1
"Good value but multi-device accounts would be good esp. for families or small businesses. Cheap and cheerful I`m on pay and go. They used to be good but now, their coverage is shockingly bad. Hardly any signal, and poor mobile data connection and speed",1
"Couldn’t get my billing right when I got an additional phone for my partner, Problems with website took long time to sort out.when I download statements & try to print them they come out virtually blank The performance of O2 SIM's card varies - some days it works well, while other days it doesn't work as well.",1
"Good value but reception has become unreliable and there is no 2FA for account. We use Sim only to run Wifi on board a narrow Boat. The signal does deteriate and wifi is lost.Coverage is the problem. The prices are cheap, but the quality and speed are terrible. You get what you pay for..",1
"The coverage of ID at times can be frustrating OK service provider, about the same as most - rarely offers good alternatives Too expensive but stuck with them since they took over from Virgin mobile",1
Cheap package but areas with poor reception and impossible to update account details I could not get my old phone removed as it's in my husbands name. Decent network been with them years. Never had any major issues,1
I get a very poor signal 1 bar even less in bad weather when staying in our caravan in Wales. Price good.Choice of packages goodService/signal not so good very variableCould not use data abroadHelp menus not very helpful Moved from Vodafone hoping for better network.Absolutely rubbish! Do better O2,1
I don't always have good signals but other people in my household using different network to me have better signals. The network signals fluctuate. Was difficult  to get thru at 1st but better mow O2used to be good until thay merged with virgin media,1
"Cheap - but for a reason, network coverage is pretty poor outside of large towns Still cannot login to online account I have changed the provider for 02, not quit what I expected ...",1
"Better signalVery rarely get 5G!!4G at best, but very poor signalUsually make wifi callsWill probably drop ID due to this I had a phone a The service in the cinema for popcorn and drinks is abysmal. 10 mins per customer. Never seen anything like it",1
"All good except my data appears to be turned off or limited in some way. I can very rarely rely on it when I am Can't make calls in house and texting difficult too Been with o2 for years always got good customer  service, however  today I really got the impression  the person I spoke to hated his job.",1
"Coverage very mixed.  Reasonable cost, but extra for things like multimedia texts The upgrades offered aren't always available. Very ignorant. Eventually had my issue resolved",1
"Roaming never work abroad OK - eventually sorted out a big problem with the account about 15 months ago - OK since then. I don't have many problems with O2. Yes their coverage is not as good as some networks and so is patchy at times, but they're generally okay",1
"IDF..YOUR PRICES ARE VERY GOOD, ONLY ONE COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU CANT RING FOR ADVICE ON A FREE NUMBER. Too frequently poor signal or no signal. Not always good reception Experience has been alright. I have good reception but prices are crazy.",1
Is very hard to get hold of customer service within normal expecting time for a call center Find it hard to contact you with any problems Everything seems to be challenging with o2 from upgrading phones for our business to getting support from their business team. Needs a real shake up!,1
"Weak signal in comparison to others specially when in towns like London. Variable coverage.  No usable coverage in my area Just joined O2 from three as I have poor signal. I have already been sent a bill despite not even having my sim card yet whish is, I think, a bit rich",1
"Access to internet is patchy. Even at home when others are fine, mine cuts out. When you can get a signal it’s a great deal but the signal has been getting worse and worse in the East Riding over the last year or so. Seem to treat different customers in a different manner. Called Sir when I'm a business customer, Alan if I have a problem with my personal phone.",1
"Very good mobile rates, reception sometimes poor.Good app. It's cheap, but absolutely zero ways to speak to anyone.Get what you pay for I guess The phone service is always helpful but every time I have spoken to live chat they end up getting it wrong. This time sent us the incorrect sim cards.",1
"Reception can b slow , the signal is often not very good Sometimes don't get a very good reception on some phone calls Must say the event was perfect but leading up it was awful trying to get through to customer services please please fix this!",1
The signal is quite poor in certain areas Problem with the national test not coming through and sometimes texts sticking in the ether. good coverage not bad pricing only gripe is 24 month contracts but been with them since it was cellnet 17 years so they must be doing something right,1
Pleased with phone.      Needed to see and inspect before purchase. Voice calls and internet access whilst out and about (in the UK and Europe) are very poor or impossible without logging onto someone elses’s wifi. Why is your VAT ridiculous now and why do you KEEP on raising my bill. I'm going to be paying £45 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone,1
Could do more to inform me of other tariffs. Good value but often poor connection when out and about. Not able to use on London Underground 😞 My grip is the broadband I have with them the service could be better I've been with O2 a few years and you don't get anything for loyalty,1
On occasion I can’t get service and 5G or 6G doesn’t help either No warm body to talk to when you have a problem. Have moved from Vodafone after ten years (ouch!) as O2 offered a good deal and Vodafone couldnt match it. Have so far been pleasantly surprised.,1
"The signal can be a bit patchy at times but the value for money is great. Not having free roaming in Australia. We have a couple of iPhones and Blackberries with O2. The service is usually problem free, but we find that 3G coverage is really hit and miss.",1
no reception at waterloo station Can’t use the app Very limited 4g coverage in central london and surrounding areas.  Vodafone was much better.O2 priority makes it just about worthwhile.,1
"Mobile phone service around my home and work are not great. Very difficult to get to speak to a real person. Thinking of changing. At first I gave it 1 star, though it is what it is. Which is a simple app. Nothing great and nothing awful.",1
"Overall very good, but upgrades for existing customers much more expensive than deals for new customers I’ve no problems, haven’t had to phone for years,So hard to comment on anything, Signal is awful, monthly contract prices are criminal but they're the best of a bad bunch.",1
"Good price, but often get no signal, so can't make a call. We're I live is very bad phone coverage can be on the phone and it cuts out all the time I often loose signals on O2. I previously used Vodafone and never experienced any problems. Its not that bad but not that good either.",1
I don't always get a good signal when using the phone Coverage not great. Sometimes only 3g in our area. Good service but I ordered an Adroid Ace and it said on the O2 website I could get BBC iPlayer which was actually incorrect.,1
Its average not great Service and signal has been really patchy lately. Calls keep getting dropped or people can't hear me. It's really frustrating ! Good customer service just never take out O2 insurance hard to find there number and impossible to make a claim,1
Still waiting for your response for my request That all off your date you have left does not carry  over Helpful advice from O2 shop in seeking mobile phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history.,1
"Quite often I cant get a signal to make a call New ZealandIt would be useful if roaming applied to other destinations other than EU O2 refresh good, allowed to upgraded 13 months early for free however very poor speeds in my area",1
"Poor Signal in Croydon and 5g is very rare, I have been over paying for a long time and have had no replies to my inquiries.Have sent many letters to you over the past 12 months.Louise The contracts are decent and signal is good. The customer service is not reachable though!",1
"Cheap, but with that very poor signal coverage. The one and only concern about ID is that the monthly charge goes up with inflation each year. The signal in my area isn't brilliant although my bill isn't too bad.",1
"Not being able to speak to anyone when you have a problem. Often I cannot use the phone outside as mobile data not working Far too quick to get you as a customer, very little service afterwards...",1
"No service most time in Bodmin It’s alright  now , Thank you, I’m over it!   C. Can't wait for my mobile contract to end so I can change supplier",1
Everything is difficult to do or find out do not get good signal my old phone was better than the one i have now not getting the coverage i would like in some areas of hampshire,1
"Prices are very competitive but coverage is not brilliant Day to day service okay BUT impossible to log in to the account Coverages OK, but customer service center could be better.",1
Many places cannot get reception Service in the U.K. is excellent but I’m very disappointed that the company can’t offer a fixed price package for our trip to the USA. Good network but poor signal in the Birmingham area,1
"Need a person to contact, chat bots are not for me. I experience too many problems with id mobile. The best service provider but the prices very high.",1
Your connection to the internet is crap. Everytime we go on holiday to Isle of Wight I can't use it. No signal or its very weak. PASYG cheap but coverage only fair,1
"I love the phone, but the signal is quite bad when out of WiFi the network coverage is poor but the price is low Solid but evil on pricing",1
"Signal is poor. There is no physical person to speak to, just ai bots... that is not good for a phone company when people have a problem. Ripped me off",1
Poor signal I was happy with O2 until Currys moved me to ID Mobile. never used,1
"Having problem with network signal Service was good whilst on holiday recently to Portugal. Signal quite good in Portugal. NOT GOOD where we live in Middlewich, Cheshire. 02 seem to faver the pay as u go customers over the contract customers,  (ie) free this free that but if your on contract zilch.",1
"I have found ID most times OK. Disappointed in coverage especially at home. Good, but i'm jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment",1
"Occasionally difficult to use internationally It's ok, just a lot of dead spots where the is literally no signal at all. Which is bit of a concern having medical issues I've never had a problem with the customer service side of o2 but find the reception to be very hit or miss.  Seems to be worse now I have an iphone.",1
"Good value for money Frustrated that I cannot access my account online. I have changed my password 4 times to no avail , all the companies need to start valuing their customers and not overcharging wherever they can",1
non very well Can't get very signal. Was told you would send me a new sim card but never received one many hidden charges and always charges over my monthly bill,1
"Customer service and actually getting to speak to someone is very bad when you have a problem, otherwise when all working it's good. Not easy to speak to anyone is my only issue see above as this summarises everything",1
"Don't like that picture messages are not included in monthly allowance I don't always have a good signal, therefore I can't always gain access to open my apps keeps it simple",1
"Very good value for money although the coverage isnt great sometimes even in centers of cities or towns Zero reception at my home initially took weeks to sort it out. Now improved. your CS is good, insurance is diabolical,",1
The signal is not cover some part of the country.No 5G available.Good value for money. Good for using abroad. The signal isn't great on the outskirts of Durham. Most Networks are saturate in the London area-but O2 still works very strong.But 3G on O2 is extremly slow while moving in a train or driving,1
"Service I average I can never log on to check usage.Networks is average, plenty of areas where there is no signal Very intermittent signal around Carmarthen Also a reasonable help line",1
"Great prices and service. Just a real shame they don’t offer Apple Watch support. That is the only reason I left. The only issue I have is that I quite often have no, or a weak signal compared to my last provider.Otherwise fine. biggest problem loyal customers who want to stay, but get priced out you only get a deal when you cancel or are a new customer??",1
"It's ok, not the best service but alright, nothing special. Major problem receiving security codes from bank.  Had to change to landline.  It's really a pity as most everything else is fine. I find that o2 has the best mobile signal around the country. their customer service and tarriffs are not the best though",1
"Your signal is sometimes crap, you can't send mojos with a message I get charged my phone keeps loosing WiFi signal and difficult to pick WiFi up Price great but poor mobile service in my area ...a bit sketchy in Woodingdean, Brighton though.",1
Roaming charges overseas very expensive WiFi in public places 😱 no email contact. you claim 24/7 support but only through automated A good network however the coverage isnt always great. But all the tariffs are good on pay and go simplicity and unlimited,1
Roaming charges very expensive charged for WiFi overseas in public places 😱 Often have trouble getting a strong signal. Can be slow.Good value. Good service on the app. had to wait ages for a refund,1
"The coverage is notva good as i would like Service and value is fine. Unable to access the app, so unable to apply any control. Inability to speak to an agent, sucks. MY ORDER WAS PLACED ON THE 15TH OF DEC AND I PAID 5,88 FOR POSTAGE AND NOT RECIVED MY PRODUCT JUST HOPE ITS HERE FOR XMAS",1
"Signal coverage could be better, particularly when I'm at home (DL17 postcode) It is an inexpensive contact. However I don't seem to get the data coverage I did with Vodaphone previously. I generally get good coverage from 02 and have no complaints although the calls when overseas still seem excessive.",1
"Plan price and phone (Google pixel 7A) very good, Mobile coverage very sketchy. Good price ok service Unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers...",1
"I think ID mobile should include free picture messaging in their contracts. Better Network Everytime I upgrade I seems to get a lower value deal, it would be nice if o2 concidered the value of loyalty as much as it does new new business.",1
"Really poor service. Really poor product and really poor coverage. Pretty good, apart from giving my Pac request that I did not ask for and attempted to get in my bank account Ok overall but the tarrif for iphones seem a bit high.",1
Signal in north west England is crap couldn't use internet. Had a lot of problems getting on the app I can't complain about the coverage but the customer service at o2 especially for business customers is appalling,1
No real criticism I just don't give platitudes Not great coverage Improvements could  be made when responding to complaints via email -,1
"More innovation as to roaming, packages and do not rely on consumers to stick with ID if there are no incentives/offers Good value in UK and Europe.Hopeless in India.  I’d have happily paid a daily rate such as Vodafone do. Like coverage",1
Internet coverage isn't great quite often I struggle to get a signal Can’t get the updated app to work. Frequently there is no signal. hard to get VAT    invoices,1
"The signal can be very poor where I am living Improve communication and support customers who have not been fully updated with changes in the app Love my Iphone.  But dont love that although I aready pay for a data pack, they are charging me for an Iphone data pack as well!",1
"Signal is poor and drops out anywhere in U( Coverage is poor compared to other networks fairly good reception, I don't know how to log on to check bill they don't make it very clear.",1
"The coverage is not the best Signal is not as good as they like you to believe often 1 or 2 bars only I have never experienced any problems as a  low user wih O2.Perhaps I am lucky,but I always get a good signal with good sound quality.",1
"My only real gripe is that when I’m travelling around the country I have to rely on free Wi-Fi my data never seems to work Always liked ID. Still using them.  Change over a bit complicated with mixed emails.   Phone still out if stock with Curry’s.  Don’t like new app Good reliable phone service, however the longer you've been with them the less perks you get until there's no difference between them and others...",1
"Definitely good value but the data coverage isn't always great. I just need to change supplier data and reception is poor 😕 I kept it for the added roaming but when I recently used that was very intermittent. i have used o2 all my life and only recently experienced problems, i plan on changing to vodafone soon",1
"Coverage isn’t as good as advertised. Quite a few dead areas. Which lets the network down. Everything else works perfectly Am finding the service where I can use my phone is limited when I go out of my local area Overpriced but good customer service, if you need it.",1
"I like rates and the coverage in the UK,  however abroad it is so expensive to use even in a European member state such as Montenegro or When I log in it goes straight to my wife's account. I can't access my account individually Good Service. But not satisfied with the billing system. Sometimes comes more sometimes less??????",1
"Trying to upgrade but can’t because 2 accounts are in my name me and my wife and use same email so can’t look what I have used. Very poor coverage up in the highlands of Scotland compared to my other contract with EE Dropped calls, rubbish 3G coverage.",1
"Signal. Is terrible. Downloading painful. Once contract is up I think I will go back to EE. Great value, but awful signal in Leeds If you are not connected to wifi it is terrible. Unlimited internet lol if it even loads.",1
"Coverage and 4g/5g is great, the app let's ID mobile down as it very rarely works Tried to ""speek"" to someone is like pulling teeth. Why not incorperate your mid contract price hype into the start of the contract. Their people on chat had a number next to their names.  For that, I will give them 3 stars.  More companies should do this.",1
In the past I have found difficulty with logging on and have had to change passwords on a number of occasions. Poor reception in many areas I visit on holiday. I really have liked t-mobile for years but their phone customer service has fallen off a cliff the last few months unfortunately.,1
"Very good price. European coverage has been frustratingly poor for me. The prices are good, but they take far too long to correct issues with their app and website. Many customers couldn't view their bills for weeks. I use T-Mobile and I give them 5 stars for free data across the world, but 1 star for the coverage, so I end up at 3 stars. :-/",1
"I dont like being charged to send photos I tried to log into the ID app. It asked for my email password. Not my ID password, but my actual email password. 4651 w 6th st.Excellent service, very knowledgeable, really helpful with their suggestions.",1
"Poor phone signal in my area. Otherwise great communication I only have 1 bar when at home, when I used to have 4-5 bars when I used to be with EE. I have no problems with calling but their internet connection is sometimes slow.",1
"Constant poor signal and could hardly ever use the Internet. My sim only deal is fab my only complaint is that it doesn’t work when I’m on holiday in Europe ie,… Portugal, turkey, Greece Not the best but decent",1
"The network etc works fine but the app is a complete nightmare and won’t let me on it. Just visited Durham city and my signal was very poor unable to take calls at one point. Even though the caller kept trying We have broadband with Vodafone it I cheap and drops out quite often but generally ok, don't expect the best.",1
"I travel all over the UK, and the signal is petty bad calls always dropping same with the data Despite using 3 network I sometimes struggle to get a good connection.Good price and customer service. Reputable, but old-school creepy. Hard sell marketing and ask way too much information on sign up. No pay by credit card.",1
Poor reception where I live and really find it hard to work out from the Ap when my contract ends - but I’ll be switching as soon as I can I was told I would get a £100 voucher when I updated my phone. Still waiting after a week. Can’t say I’m overly impressed after having very slow Internet for over five days their response is not adequate.,1
"It’s ok, not the best service, weak signals outdoors I have been a customer for many years..maybe loyalty reward perhaps would be great. Very difficult to deal with sorting out a direct debit issue.  Once my contract up up I’ll I think twice about renewal this time around.",1
"It would be very useful to have up-to-the information on recent data usage and cost incurred- displayed on your app. Don’t like very often having no service, will be changing back to my old provider Chloe was great. Very friendly and personable. However finding opening hours or contacting the store is impossible.",1
"I have been having the worst signal since I have been with this company. It's so frustrating for me, tbh I can't wait until my contract finishes. Why do I have to register every time I open the app, it is becoming very annoying. App always down early hours of morning can never rely on making payments as it never works",1
I have trouble getting a signal in my house and places outside of my home. Never had this problem using a previous network. I am waiting for your website to come back online. Rayyan helped me upgrade my phone and helped solve past problems caused by Vodafone from ages ago.,1
"It's ok,Internet drops out now and again so that can be annoying FIVE DAYS, YES FIVE DAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT TO MY ACCOUNT In Manchester, between 19-22, the internet is practically unused.  YT max 144p, but my brother provides hotspot three and it's running nice.",1
The reception is not always good plus WhatsApp doesn't always work People cannot ring on it. I tried to get in touch with you but system didn't seem to be working. Obviously disappointed I considered you for many years a 5 star service but over the last several years you are losing that touch.,1
"Good low cost mobile connection. Difficult to speak to any customer service staff about an issue I have! Could offer more data for the price in today's market but overall ok.Connection is poor in some locations so limited. Long wait,  see how client was argue with one of the customers service lady …",1
Generally happy with it but I wish they had a phone number to use for questions as well as a chat facility There's a lot of time I get cut off in the middle of a call. I queued for 20 minutes before being seen   Some customers left before then.,1
I can't go over my data plan or use competion numbers. Good value but signal not always good. 5G not available or reliable in my area. I didn't really like Vodafone. I used it for three months. Tariffs are raised all the time. Bad internet. I wouldn't advise it.,1
"The price rise half way through the contract is extortionate and really takes the mickey. Data connection too slow Don't use this vodafone its horrible, but our local store is helpful",1
I have to contracts with you mine and my sons and am struggling to pat for them every month Coverage not always great at home.  Very annoying re international service - charges are expensive. The offer was not so good as I was expecting,1
Signal isn’t very good At times it will not pick up signal to allow me to browse the Internet....Otherwise I am happy with notifications regarding using sims outside UK. Been with Vodafone for many years now. Service is not always up to scratch and need to pay for roaming in Europe,1
Value for money but poor coverage in rural areas Too expensive Ok service however long wait time and not great attitude of staff.,1
Not enough information on app about contract end dates and if it is possible to change plans when in or out of contract. Hate it when I am in the middle of doing something and then the phone cuts in. Minimal signal but spoke to a lovely lady Katie and everything resolved. Thanks.,1
"Lack of contact with real person. Bot sent me round in circles without solving problem. I need a warning if I’m going over my allowance of minutes, messages or gigs please. Very helpfulHowever I was given some incorrect information about data roaming world wide",1
"Very weak unreliable reception, unfit to run 2 devices at same time, so had to change to other provider with stronger WiFi strength. Not always good reception in the Hampshire New Forest District.... Even with a good signal on 4G it's very very slow. There's no news of 5G in my area even though I was told it should be up and running soon.",1
Poor serviceBetter coverage good value package inc roaming but unfortunately poor signal at home & poor customer service when raising issues 33mb download todaySupposed to be 50+ having a very bad time playing WOT,1
"I just find alot of people say  when I am on a call I fade in and out ...dont think it is a problem with the phone but with the network Overall ok, but not reliable. Paying for a 70mb+ link but actually getting 58mb!! Poor shoe",1
"OK but reception iffy in some areas probably due to 3G switch off, may go to an EE MVNO eventually. Data connection very poor generally. All very well offering high GB's of data with plans but if the connection is poor what's the point? Took an hour and twenty minutes to get served, once I got seen Rory was excellent",1
Rollover data is fine. But the network suddenly started having many issues The sims cheap. But often i cant get internet outside. Am going to end my contact. Very good attention excellent professionals thanks to Karina and LuisLower Marsh,1

When I took out my contract at £43 pm within 1 week you could get it for £34 I've had pretty good service over the years. But the process of negotiating a fairly priced upgrade is getting harder and harder,1

"I am a new AT&T customer. Your install team--Joe and Lee--were here at my home for about 4 hours on 1.10.25. They were both extremely pleasant, patient, helpful and conscientious. They took great care in choosing the best location for our new AT&T Internet equipment and were fastidious in keeping our home just as they found it. They were the most courteous of ""workmen"" we could have in and out of our house for several hours. We honestly enjoyed speaking with them and finding them both personable and thoughtful. We recommend them very highly and they gave us the absolute best first impression of our new relationship with AT&T!Also, I want to comment on Blaine, an ""account"" man who came while Joe and Lee were here. He was also a most pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable employee of whom you may be proud! He explained many things about our service and even gave suggestions I found very positive and enlightening.",2

I just wanted to write a review about going to AT&T in Charlotte North Carolina on South Tryon. I receive such good service. I’m close to 70 and they spend time to explain everything to me. There was a manager named Stetson that I was very pleased with how he explained everything so I would give him a five a great review.,2
"Avery is an outstanding representative for AT&T at Best Buy in Altamonte Springs. Normally, I do not stop for sales pitches, but Avery's approach caught my attention. He actively listened to my concerns, never made me feel pressured, and allowed me to take my time with the decision. He was also incredibly courteous to other customers, assuring them he would assist them as well.This was my first experience with AT&T, and I hope the service lives up to the high standard Avery set. I took advantage of the iPhone 15 family plan deal and couldn't be happier. When I had a follow-up question after Thanksgiving, Avery responded the same day with the same level of professionalism and care.Avery doesn’t just talk the talk—he truly walks the walk. Exceptional customer service like his deserves recognition. AT&T, give this man a raise!",2

Whenever you call AT&T to hold your cellular service . They will hurry up and disconnect you . Never handle what you need for them to take care of . If you are paying your Bill or buying a new product they are quick to dismissed you .I went on a cruise and AT&T has that international fee for $12 . I cut off my WiFi my Bluetooth my cellular service . Yet they still charge d me . Everyday I took a picture to show them that it was cut off . These bastards going to say I used my phone . Then show me to where I made one phone or sent one text . The next thing they ended our conversation. I’m at the point to where I think I’m going to have to get rid of them,2

"I would like to thank Barry from AT&T for his excellent service to repair a cut fiber cable at my home in Maumelle, Arkansas. The original fiber contractors that came out were going to reroute the new cable across my front lawn and under my driveway. This would have done a lot of damage to my yard and possibly messed up my irrigation lines. I contacted AT&T service, and they sent out an inspector who did everything he could to route the new fiber cable through its original path so there was no need dig up my yard. Barry was terrific. Barry certainly deserves all the credit and made my day by resolving this issue. I am now a big fan of AT&T and highly recommend them.",2
"Never take AT&T . This is a bullshit company. Great scam I have ever seen. I did trade-in and later on paid of the device to unlock the device. Technically I paid 2 times , later on they take out my trading credit form bill coz i paid of the device. And they do scam when i purchase the line they did not explain me that it has 36 month contract, They said you can move anytime. That was another trap for me. It's been 1 year's i am still overpaying everybills. If i leave i have to pay a lot for each phone. Never chose this company. Your life will be in hell like me.😞. Also agent said their system has some billing problem, If your system has problem why we will pay more money for that?? My request everyone please never take AT&T.",2

"I had  recently added  AT&T phone service  to my long standing internet  service. I got  my  Galaxys24 FE in th email, its a much better  and more advanced phone than Im use to. I was disheartened when I called several stores in my area (Tulsa) to be told they couldnt help me with file transfers or anything tech support related. I finally made the call to customer service, and the tech that got on the phone was corteous and  knowledgable, he took the time to understand my issue, and had the patience to calmy walk me through every detail and help me understand each process so I would be a more informed  customer of my devices. He even went above and beyond to help me fix  the home wi-fi crisis that plagued me for over 2 years. Id like to personally thank AT&T  for  keeping such fine customer service  reps  and techs employed. Though it took time, mostly due to me, I did take the extra time to speak to his supervisor and ensure they knew I was impressed and thankful for all that my tech did. I believe in giving praise  for excellence in customer care. Thank you",2

I’ve had AT&T for 5 years now and my bundle discounts were never applied for having their internet and phone services. They were not willing to give me a discount by a manager.

She was able to apply some discount for being a loyal customer. She didn’t want to lose a loyal customer. Thank you again Trinity.,2

"I am clueless with technology, but Erich at your Aliso Viejo store was fabulous yesterday with turning on my new Apple iPhone, connecting my old phone info and setting up my iPad to connect everything up for me!  My old phone was dead,really dead as it had been dropped into a pool of water. Fortunately, Erich decided to try the SIM card and wa-la…….it all came together. So please reach out to Erich and thank him for helping a 72 year old lady have the greatest day in months!👍",2
"I had an amazing time there. Specifically with the employee that helped, his name was tim. And he was on par. Absolutely no time for failure he got me in there setup with a new phone new AirPods and was just exactly what I look for in an employee. He’s located on glassford hill road in Prescott valley AZ! Great job Tim!!",2

I'm grateful to the 3 AT&T representatives who tried to help me fix a problem that their employer caused on my accounts:Elpon in Direct TV StreamingSandy in WirelessAbraham in Home Telephones,2
"Jimmy came out and helped me with my internet, he was great he stayed and made sure everything was working for me. He had a great attitude.",2
Received experienced and friendly service. Was extremely happy with Blake & Beau for being courteous and understanding with my specific requests.  Sending kudos to these 2 guys @ the At&t Store @ 1636 SE Blue Pkwy Lee's Summit Mo,2
"Lindsey T at the AT&T Toccoa, Ga store was amazing. Not only was she extremely friendly, but also so helpful and efficient. I am very pleased with the service I received today with setting up my first responder account.",2
"We’ve had AT&T wireless for many years. To be honest, I’ve often thought about making a change. Today, I was so fortunate to have AT&T. The accolades go out to Destiny, who works in the AT&T store in Perrysburg, Oh. We have been to another AT&T store, an electronic store, have checked online & spoken with Apple support. Until today, no one could help my son sync his watch to his new phone. Thanks to Destiny & her knowledge & her patience, she got it synced!",2
"Wonderful company - I have had AT&T Prepaid for a couple weeks, going on month and the company has been great! The service is reliable, and the customer care team has been nothing short of amazing. I remember when I was activating my phone and I was short by a couple dollars, the rep who was awesome did a credit, helped me and had my service up and running with no issues. The plans are great, the website works like a charm. However, I do wish a mobile app was offered for the prepaid side, but that's okay. I will give this company a solid 10/10. I have never encountered issues with signal, customer care, or being dramatically congested and slowed down. Truly unlimited for $65.00 is a deal. That's for sure! I highly recommend AT&T Prepaid.",2
"On 15FEB23 at 4PM , my wife and I visited the AT&T store on Whittesey Blvd. in Columbus, Ga. to explore options for unlimited cellular data from AT&T. After a short wait, we were greeted by DJ, the Retail Sales Consultant. DJ immediately understood the purpose of our visit and quickly went over the various options for cellular data to include monthly costs and the application of my veterans discount. DJ was very professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. He exhibited genuine concern that our cellular needs were met and that we were fully satisfied with the plan we received. AT&T is fortunate to have DJ as a front line customer service representative.Thank you,John Baggett",2
I had a bad experience with one. Don't let that be the impression of AT&T because EVERYONE ELSE was very attentive and cared. They resolved my issues and I thank them bunches. Happy Hollidays and good luck dealing with all of us out here.,2
I wanted to make sure I shouted out to Alex from the Haines City ATT store. I went into the store on a Sunday to port my mom's phone from Boost Infinity and Alex took such good care of us. He answered all my mothers questions. For such a young person he was very professional.Thank you MaryAnn Lamboy,2
"Called AT&T for tech support and Angela delivered exceptional customer service. She is very knowledgeable, courteous and patient. In today’s world, customer service is at an all time low, Angela has been exceptional and should be recognized!!",2
I have been with ATT since 2001 and have had issue but they were fixed and adjusted with ease. If you come with the right way of doing things it’s what you usually get back.,2
I can finally say there some great represenatives.here are some names Joe.Stephane.Amy.Lane.Robert hope I did not miss anyone sorry for miss spelling.I have done alot of negative review.now it is time to give positive,2
"We received excellent customer service at the store in Destin Fl. Brooke Cato was knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. I’m not real phone savvy so she had to answer a lot of questions. Thank you Brooke for all the help and information you gave us.",2
"I needed a new screen saver for my phone. Our local ATT store didn't have one for my particular phone. I purchased one from Walmart and took it to ATT for them to apply. Tyler at Farmington, MO was the most patient and helpful person I have ever encountered at a store. Thanks for making this old lady happy. I would have never been able to put the screen protector on.",2
The people at att in marble falls were extremely nice and caring helped me my fiancé and her family get on the same plan and so far no issues thank you guys very much,2

"My first experience with At&t was with Dorthy. She was very friendly and answered all my comments and concerns. Next Richard helped me set up my military discount and direct pay. He was just as helpful as Dorthy was and finally, Anna at the store here in Minneapolis finalized both my discounts. I have a brain injury and all 3, Dorthy, Richard and Anna all helped me with passion and understanding with ALL my concerns. Thank u At&t for hiring  Dorthy, Richard and Anna. I don't remember the dates of me talking with them but I want them to know, thank u for helping me! To At&t corporate, give them a raise!!-Adam Krick",2
"I visited the AT & T store in Prescott, Arizona and Precious Jewel Lira was was my customer service assistant. She was super professional & personable. Ms. Lira aided me in every requested aspect of my technology purchases(i.e. getting devices set up & linked, fielding various queries, etc ).

"Had a delightful conversation with one of the support agents. My internet had been suspended, but it turned out there was an issue in their system. Lucy was very quick to see the issue and resolve it, for which I am very thankful.",2
"At&T employee Lakisha Defreese at the Wilson At&t store was fabulous. She was very knowledgeable, patient, and kind. I was so happy that she provided my service. She should train people on how to provide excellent customer service. She is also knowledgeable. I would recommend you give her a raise and keep her. It is very, very, very hard to find quality employees. Treat the ones you have right. I want to thank her again for her excellent service.",2
I have liked AT&Ts service. The real reason for the review though is to thank Jen in customer support. She solved a problem for me efficiently and it was an issue no other AT&T service rep was able to figure out. She located my trade in phone which was somehow not processed initially. She put my mind at ease.  She was great!,2
"We use AT&T for internet and wireless services. So far we have been happy with the fees and service overall. At times the internet can be slower, but they have so many various levels you can choose which internet level you need. I need the highest since I stream, trade options and do a lot of internet shopping.My cellphone service is good too. Overall no dropped calls or lag time when I am out of the house. I can surf and watch videos when we are on vacay!WOULD RECOMMEND",2
"I was trying to get on-line to make calls but since late yesterday, was unable to make any calls.  I could received them from the message site--Anyway, we went to AT&T in Gulfport, Crossroads Pkwy and was assisted by Mr. Keith Edwards, the Store Manager.  He listened to my problem, asked to see the phone and in less than a minute had everything back the way it was supposed to be.I asked him to show me his magic and it was a case of  simple ""turn off/turn on"".  He was friendly, helpful, kind----If all trips to ATT were done that way, ATT would be swamped dailyandMr. Edwards would own the company---with knowledge and kindness.",2
"A company is only as good as its employees.After being tossed around by one of its competitors, I decided to switch to AT&T and purchased two Samsung 2023 Ultras. One was stolen from my shopping cart. After several visits to an AT&T store, the personnel were very helpful but unable or unwilling to get me across the finish line. As a last resort, I decided to try another store and was taken immediately by Evan Montoya, a rare find for any company. He was extremely patient, self-confident, and super knowledgeable. And most of all, he was able to resolve my problem. He is Management material.After the replacement S2023 Ultra arrived, we returned to the store only to be told that Evan had been transferred to a new location. Although we will seek Evans's assistance with the new phone, I am confident that the young woman who told us Evan was transferred would do a competent job transferring the information and apps to the new phone. Unfortunately, I did not get her name.I would give a 5 STAR rating to two of the three AT&Tstores I visited.",2
Only good things to say about them!I have great phone service and they provide great customer service. I've been a loyal customer for years/decades and have no intention to switch.,2

My bill is also lower. She took the time to make sure all of my needs were met and all my questions answered. AT&T is fortunate to have her on staff.",2
I am literally on the phone as I write this review with AT&T. We are all so quick to write a bad review. I want to be just as quick to write a good review as I would a bad one. Customer Service with AT&T TODAY was the best I've recieved ever. As far as customer service goes. I had more than one issue and Alexis for business customer services with AT&T was remarkable! She took care of every issue I had mentioned within a 10-15 min time frame. Not only was it fast service but also super relieving concidering I work as well. So every minute can be way to time consuming but Alexis made every minute worthwhile. I am able to get right back to work with everything I requested; With enough time to write this long review as well. Thanks again Alexis your customer service is absoluty refreshing.,2
"I visited the Rome store on Turner McCall Blvd.  Lesley Osborne greeted me and helped me purchase my new 14 Pro phone.  She was friendly and patient with me.  I explained that I am an older user who did not grow up with cell phones, in fact our one phone per family was connected to the wall.  We had a great laugh and connection, and I could tell that she would be happy to help me if I needed to return. She also showed me options for an Apple Watch which I plan to purchase from her in the near future.  There was not a 14 Pro in stock, but she ordered it for me and it should arrive within 5-7 business days.  She reminded me to bring it back upon arrival and she would put the screen protector on and make sure my contacts are transferred!  THANKS!!",2

"Warm and sincere complement for sales associate JESSE KELLY at Galleria at Tyler F124 Riverside CAHe was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and forthcoming with his expertise, knowledge about products, but most importantly his kind demeanor.  I had specific questions about my iPhone 8 which he answered honestly and comprehensively. I also had concerns with 'no service' areas of my home and he addressed those issues too.He evinced excellent customer service, and I really appreciated his professional knowledge and pleasant, welcoming openness. I felt treated with respect and appreciation.He's the kind of sales associate that keeps customers coming back.",2

Christian was the best. Very knowledgeable and helpful about different product and services available. Gave us a screaming deal on IPhone 13 for $390. Can’t beat that on Apple Store. Will use again to you phrase to IPhone 15 soon.,2
Will at Grand Ave ATT in Billings MT provided good customer service.,2
"Originally, I posted a review here about trouble I faced when upgrading my iPhone through AT&T. I encountered a frustrating issue since AT&T asked me to upload an ID to confirm my identity, but after the fact I realized they actually wanted my father’s ID (the account holder) as opposed to my own, which was not clear. Thereafter, every order I attempted to place on AT&T’s website was canceled apparently for security concerns.The promotion advertised to me for upgrading my phone was online only, which meant I could not simply place my order via phone or go to an AT&T store to skirt the issue.After making my issue known, AT&T proactively contacted me and followed up daily until the problem was completely resolved. This was unexpected from such a large company, and incredibly helpful at a time when I felt like I exhausted all avenues for upgrading my phone. I would like to thank AT&T and particularly Gary V. for their outstanding customer service and for fully resolving my issue.",2
"To: AT&T Customer Service TeamI am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service I received from Tricia S. at your AT&T Authorized Retailer, located at 1810 Library Street, Reston, VA 20190.During my recent visit to the store,I was assisted by Tricia, who exhibited the utmost professionalism, knowledge, and helpfulness. She took the time to understand my needs, provided clear and thorough explanations, and ensured that I left with a complete understanding of my options.

"The AT&T store at 5012 4th Street N in St. Petersburg, FL is the best. Every member of the staff that I have met, including Justin, Austin, Todd, and the manager (whose name I didn't get) and wonderful. They are all very friendly, kind, personable as well as skilled and knowledgeable. When I look around the store, I see that it is not just me, but everyone who is having a good experience there.When the store was closing soon, Justin helped me without a problem. I noticed that he even helped some people who came in right at closing time, even though it meant that he started their transaction after closing time. That was above and beyond!Every phone I purchased from them has been great, until this last time when my phone was glitchy. Incredibly, they allowed me to trade it for a new one because I bought it less than two weeks ago. That will save me from a lot of hassle trying to repair the phone or work out the glitches with Apple.I highly recommend getting your next phone and wireless service from this AT&T store.",2
"I went to an AT&T store yesterday located in Interbay, to have my all my information from my old phone, downloaded to my new phone. There were two young ladies working in this store, both were very welcoming and sweet. Angelisa, who is helping me with my phone issues was one of the sweetest most helpful customer service person I have ever met, she not only took the time to show me a lot that my phone could do, and taught me taught me so much while she was working on my phone that I was just amazed at the customer service I received This young lady, Angelina has not worked very long at the store, but she was very knowledgeable about the iPhone and never once made me feel like I was a dummy. (Which I am when it comes to these phones) and I was very happy I I chose this store and very happy with the customer service I received. I had to deal with another phone company for a friend of mine who lost his phone and needless to say, that experience made me extremely happy I’m with AT&T. And with the experience I received yesterday from Angelina. I am customer for ever!",2
"I had a great interaction with the manager Courtney , she was professional and knowledgeable. Took great care of me!Christine Fowler-Neal",2
To be completely honest I love this company we never ever had a internet problem and it’s that good that when you go on the train and underground the video or whatever you are on is still playing the internet never stops. The price is good and the channels are amazing. Before they came to add our internet box and the cable boxes to the 3 tvs but we did have a issue were the controls didn’t seem to work because of the cable box it kept appearing a red light but then I reset it and they also said we had 100 dollars due when we payed everything but this is An amazing companyd I am so happy I changed back to this one because we changed to Optimum and it was the worst and super expensive so AT&T is awesome,2
"I have been trying to get service with AT&T but I’m not feeling good about the serviceAny ways I went store,the person work there helped me out everythingHer name is Valoric",2
I recently called AT&T to resolve a landline issue that I was having. The representative was both knowledgeable and courteous. Great service!,2
"I contacted AT&T via phone on 1/29/24 regarding a notice in my account that I could return my device and waive any remaining installment balance. It stated I had until July 31, 2024, to do this. I advised the representative that I planned to cancel my service and switch to another provider. The representative stated that the offer in my account was not valid and that AT&T does not allow returning a device past 30 days. I had the iPhone since 4/6/2022, so AT&T was aware that I had the phone in my possession for over 30 days. He did not attempt to provide any further information or keep my business. He also did not advise me that if I did not cancel before the start of my next billing cycle (which ended several days later) I would be charged an entire month of service. I previously had AT&T internet in addition to my wireless service and was only billed for the days/service used. I assumed this was the same for the wireless service. On 2/6/24, I ported my service from AT&T to another carrier. I am now being charged an entire month of service when once again, I canceled only 3 days after my billing cycle started and was never informed of this when I spoke to the representative on 1/29/24. Due to the false advertisement of being able to turn in my financed device at the current time, misinformation, and lack of quality cell phone service received from my time with AT&T, I am demanding my final bill be waived and my account settled as paid in full.3/2024 update - I was contacted by the company president who made things right. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and truly cared.",2
The check in was easy and little to no wait time to be seen by an employee and one of the employees Kiki was very helpful as I came in to get a new phone she was very hands on great knowledge and helpful she did amazing,2

"I was away in Alaska and I stopped receiving emails or being able to send them. I did receive before I left a bill. My credit card was compromised and I needed to give them my new credit card number. I received a confirmation that my $100 had been received. I photo shot the receipt. I called AT&T support while in Alaska to fix the email problem. I was on the phone for an hour and a half to no avail. I could not understand the gentleman on the line. Was told they were upgrading and I would have it restored in two days. Two days came and gone. I get home from my vacation. I get a text my service is being suspended due to lack of payment and I owed $213. I paid $100Of an $80 bill in May, now we are in the first week of June. I call support. I gave them my four digest code, said It didn’t work. I know it’s correct. Having difficulty understanding the person. After well over an hour I was told I needed to go to the store. I immediately went to the store in Raynham MA.  I met with the store manager Tyler Coward. He immediately assisted me. TookThe time to solve my dilemma. Found out they sent my first payment to the wrong account. My code was correct. Paid the correct amount, will be receiving a refund and am getting my emails. Tyler was awesome. Professional, helpful, understanding and solved my problem. I am grateful for him.",2

"Adam King, My man.For some context - I am moving and was shopping for internet for my new address. As I was browsing the website, I got a call from an number not trackable via google search.The rep said they were from AT&T and started asking for personal info such as my full name, number, home address and it was concerning from my perspective - getting a call from random number stating they are from AT&T asking for personal information after I tried to look up the number and didn't find anything.Dumb me, I gave it to them - and as soon as I did and they confirmed my address the line disconnects.I was worried and was thinking did I just get scammed?I called the phone number on the website and my man Adam King answers the phone. I called for two reasons - one, wanting to get service for a new address and two, talk about a call i just received asking for my personal info.I told Adam about what the conversation sounded like and we confirmed that it was indeed an actual AT&T Rep.but not only did we confirm the conversation I had with the unknown caller - he gave me a bunch of tips on how I can confirm with the caller to prove it's a legit person and also gave really good info on what scammers can do with certain information and assured me and said that good thing I didn't give more than just my address.I was so worried that I just got scammed and Adam gave me really good assurance.I'm just ranting at this point and i'm not really sure how to explain or talk about my gratitude and the way Adam handled my situation.HE IS THE BEST!This man was so informative and I'm so happy I got him as the person who answered my call.He went above and beyond to try and help me.@AT&T, please listen to the recorded conversation.He is amazing.We need more reps like him.",2

"I've been a longtime & faithful customer of AT&T for over 25 years. I have endured many unpleasant customer service reps over the years. After reaching my breaking point, with trade in issues, lost/stolen devices, bait & switches, & fraud, by Corporate AT&T Stores, I'd had enough. I called in on Wednesdays July 26th, to cancel my services & move all of my many lines to Verizon, despite the costs. When i called in I was already irritated from dealing with past insufficient reps, that had the empathy & customer service of a robot. I was greeted by ""AMBER FULLER"" in the customer loyalty department.  Immediately she greeted me with a true dedicated desire to help me, I had no idea what was in store for me! She quickly broke my walls of irritation down, & let me know that she was there to help & wouldn't get off of the phone until she resolved all of my problems, that she could clearly see were tons! When I tell you, she dove into the accounts in true shock, to realize everything I was stating was true, she was in disbelief, & Immediately started reaching out to managers of higher power, & to ensure that I was given a true resolution! She even got my number, & gave me her ID number & credentials to follow-up with me, to make sure all of my issues were resolved (we've all heard this before, right). Of course there were limitations on what she could do, but she put me in touch with those without limits. The very next day I was given a call by The President's Office, followed by an email with their contact info. Being in meetings I could not answer. Before I could even call back the next day, I received another call, & was able to answer this time it was ""April Witson"" from the President's office, she greeted me, & without me having to explain, plead my case, or beg for what was rightfully owed to me, 16 months in the making, for this incident. This is all because of the impeccable ground work done & notes done taken by ""AMBER FULLER"".April began to tell me, what was done to make me whole. An immediate retroactive credit was given that was applied immediately, no more waits, or fake business days, as i was told previously!!! ""AMBER FULLER"" even followed up as she promised she would. When I say my faith has been restored into AT&T, because of AMBER showing true empathy, genuine care, & loyalty: a repeated hellacious upgrade experience, will be no more! After 16 months of being wronged in this instance, because of ""AMBER"" I was finally made whole. For all of my AT&T needs going further I will always TRUST AMBER to get it done!!! AT&T honestly needs to reward her, & she truly needs to be a Customer Loyalty Training Manager. Because she truly exemplifies what a TRUE CUSTOMER LOYALTY REPRESENTATIVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. ""Hats off to ""AMBER FULLER' for truly being the best part of AT&T.",2
"I am an AT&T customer over twenty years. Over the years I have experienced the good the bad and the very bad! However on January 4, I went into the Plantation Sunrise store to upgrade my phone. My purse had been stolen a week before and I needed a new phone. I went the night before after 6:00pm. I was helped but it felt half- hearted that evening by the store associates. I left feeling extremely disappointed. They seemed uninterested in helping me and passed me along to two other associates. No one seemed to be tuned into what I needed and almost felt like I was left hanging. Half - hearted, no smiles and poor customer service. HOWEVER the next day I went back to give it another try and upgrade my phone … and by the luck of the draw, I got Carlos M! As the song goes, “ what a difference a day makes.” Carlos was smiling, happy to help me, took time with me to explain things and made me feel like an important customer who has been a loyal customer over twenty years. I felt valued and left with a smile and feeling great with my iPhone 15 upgrade!  I am not tech savvy and asked Carlos what he would want his mom to have. He said, “ my mom has a iPhone 15 and it’s a great phone! Me being a photographer, Carlos said I will love the camera quality. He set my phone up and showed me what I needed to do! This IS the kind of associate / employee you want to have working for you!! He was efficient, stayed focused and I felt sincerely tuned into and he was helping me. Maybe people have worked there for too long and need a break or a refresher course in customer service. Maybe the associates have forgotten how to look at customers and smile and look them in the face. Maybe it’s just become a boring, get my pay check and go job!  This plantation location on Sunrise  is my store that I go into for all my AT&T needs. I pay my phone bill there and browse the store looking for new products.  I am a business owner and have spend thousands and thousands of dollars with your company.

"I’ve been having on again off again issues with att. A family member recently passed. Payment was delayed and our phones were turned off. When trying to explain my situation with Customer Service in an attempt to avoid having to pay the reconnection fee, to the customer service reps were very combative and rude. I paid the fee regardless to reinstate our lines. my elderly father is a part of the family plan. And did not want him to go without. Today I received a spam notification of my phone line being turned off. Spoke to customer service rep Stacy. She was completely the opposite and was very Kind and understanding. She helped me through the process of explaining my phone bill and assured I was not overdue on any payments. Even took the time to adjust the fee off that I had previously disputed with the other two reps. She has reinstated my hope in good customer service with this company. I should’ve gotten her last name. Thank you",2

"I have read the terrible reviews for AT&T company and AT&T customer service and don't understand why a company lets this happen.I don't know so much about the company as a whole because our phones were purchased online by our daughter recently .  I do know there was one item ordered that was not included.  But that's another story.I want to write about a particular employee named Ty who was so very kind and helplful to me and helped set up our new phones for us.  I went into the Bloomingdale store in Brandon, Fl. a few months ago to get help with our old phones and the employee was less than helpful. So I hesitated to go back to that store.  But it is close so I decided to try again.  And Ty met me at the door and patiently guided me through the setup.  He did not receive a commission for a sale but was kind and courteous to an old lady.  So if you go to this store, just ask for Ty.",2

"I had the pleasure of working with Lewis of your AT&T office in Culpeper, VA.  I came to this office to get help with my new Series 3 Apple watch.  I am not very verse with these types of products. Right away Lewis was knowledgeable on the Series 3 watch.  He explained what needed to be done to get the watch up and running.  At one point I had to leave to do an errand and when I returned he was ready to finish the process. During our time when the phone was going through the pairing process with the watch, he gave me a great summary on the features of the Series 3.  Throughout the whole process Lewis was polite and very professional.  He was patient with me.  Because of him I will come back to this office.  I think he sets the bar for excellent customer service.  Thank you Lewis.Melissa Miles",2
"Today, my faith in FACE-to-FACE customer service has been restored. Phone assistance is not for the patience. Today, Scott (Att) at the AT&T Retail store next to Staples in Charlottesville was an honest down to earth advisor. Without a lot of fancy words explained to me why my new AT&T phone and Mom's PACE maker transmitter (AT&T carrier Phone) did not work in the location of Nelson County even thou it may have a Tower it didn't source out to AT&T. She has no internet nor WIFI. But with a prior purchased Orbit Speed he paired the AT&T phone to my Orbit Speed to allow my Mom's Unit to be monitored and likely save her health as it will allow remote adjustments now.  Blessings and gratitude to this dear Representative. If call there please tell his Supervisor and ask for Scott at 434-249-8454..",2

"I have a older ZTE phone (Pre Paid) which needed a card upgrade from 3G in order to recognize and run with the new 5G level. Justin Morgan, Asst. Manager of the Mount Vernon AT&T store, 7702F Richmond Hwy, VA  22306 was extremely helpful on three different occasions to target the problem and get my problem resolved. The card illusive to find. Once I found the card and received it from the main company, he sat with me while we made the call to ATT&T for the card to be formatted for my phone. He is the kind of person you would WANT to work with and would expect to find in an AT&T store when you need help. He knew the problem. He knew the phone, and he worked it through to the answers. He calmly listened, had a sense of humor and was pleasant to work. He is mature and has a demeanor well suited to handle higher positions of responsibility and is certainly an asset to AT&T. He's a keeper.",2

"I went to my local AT&T store (in north Winston-Salem, NC) a couple of nights ago, anticipating that I would be switching cell phone carriers.  Instead, my customer service agent Shady (yes, ironically, that was his name) listened to everything I had to say and ultimately advised me to buy a new cell phone elsewhere.  He understood that I am retired, living on a fixed income and unwilling and unable to pay $500 to $1000 for a phone.  Nor did I need to overload on gigabytes.  I use my phone for calls and texts and minimally for on-line searches.  Shady did not attempt to sell me any more than what I was asking for.  When I complimented him, he simply said, ""I try to give customers what they want.""  WHAT A CONCEPT!  I was impressed, went on line and purchased a refurbished phone and will continue as a loyal AT&T customer.  I have been with them for close to 20 years, after dumping Verizon for constantly bombarding me with ""offers"" to increase my bill.  Excellent customer service DOES still exist.  Thank you, Shady, for restoring my faith!",2

"I've been an AT&T customer for almost 10 years. I love them, they've always been good to me and helped me with any issues I had. Of course with any company there will be issues that arise but they have always worked with me to correct them. They value loyalty as much as I as I do and whenever I call the customer service I always reach a friendly, knowledge and helpful representative in a timely manner. I had an issue last year with someone committing fraud against me within a rival cellular company and AT&T was willing to help me prove the fraudulent activity and offered to get any documentation necessary to show the rival company that the person that opened that account wasn't me. Though their assistance didn't end up being needed due to me being able to prove fraud on my own, the fact they offered shows how loyal they're as a company. LOVE AT&T, 10 YEAR CUSTOMER & COUNTING. CUSTOMER 4EVER",2

I traded my phone for a new one. Appalonia was great with alot of knowledge and awesome customer service. Erin on the other hand was horrible. Customers came in 4 times asking questions as he sat in his chair like he didn't care. He is the reason people like me walk out and go somewhere else instead of at & t. This guy had an attitude in front of me with her and didn't seem to care. Ellsworth store in queen creek is great if appolonia is there but Erin should not be employed there,2

"Att customer service let me down on the phone, all I wanted was a line added to my account, a SIM card because we already had a phone. After being on the phone with them for almost an hour because they sent a suspended SIM card, they were of no help. They didn’t know what they were doing. So I hung up and drove to att store on s. MacArthur and explained to Melissa a wonderful lady with experience what was going on, it took a mere 15 minutes max for her to help and resolve the problem.What a waste of time to call customer service, no one is on the same page.So glad I went to att store!!!! Thank you Melissa!!!!!! She’s awesome! Okc, ok",2
"I spoke with sales rep Shaun Thompson via video chat on the AT&T website. He was extremely knowledgeable and provided excellent customer service.

"WOW! I have never been wowed by customer service representative over the phone before until now. Marybelle (I believe that’s how you spell her name?) is the complete epitome of what a customer service representative should be like. From great and happy attitude, to helpfulness and getting straight to resolving the issue at hand - she is just outstanding. She was very personable and related to me and my issues. She was aware of my problem, and quickly after fixing that one, she was able to offer me an upgraded plan that would be extremely beneficial to me. Yes, every salesperson’s job is to sell an upgrade to the customer, but she knew her queue when to discuss about it without sounding pushy or robotic, as if she was reading some type of script. She was very knowledgeable about her work, which allowed her to naturally flow into a very affordable upgrade plan that would blow my current plan out of the waters.I was going to do these steps for myself on the app anyway, but maybe I would have overlooked it if it wasn’t for her recommendation. I’m truly grateful. I never write these type of reviews. She made my morning. And let’s be honest, not many people can say that about their mobile service providers and representatives. Very well spoken, helpful, and knowledgeable. GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE OR A PROMOTION! Well deserved, IMO.",2

"On 12/23/2021 I entered the AT&T store in Robinson Mall with what I thought what's a complicated problem. At that time I was greeted bye a young lady named Kalie D. When I told her I had a complicated problem he asked me what the problem was and then said oh that's not complicated I can help you and boy did she, she got me the best deal that I've ever gotten on a cell phone plan and for that I say thank you. I sure hope that AT&T knows what kind of an outstanding employee that they actually have with Kalie D. I personally think that this kind of an employee who goes above and beyond to help the customer and the company to get a promotion and or a raise she does deserve it",2
I had been with Sprint 20 years.— when T-Mobile merged the service went downhill. I decided to give AT&T a try. So glad I did! their coverage is great. I have 5G coverage even in my rural area. Their plans are flexible.c customer service is friendly and timely. I can get an expert right to my door to deliver new equipment and make sure it is set up correctly.During my contacts with customer service they have been flexible and willing to work outside the box to make sure my needs were addressed.I recently got a Great international calling plan and they even backdated the plan so that it would cover a call I had already made.I feel like they really value my business.,2

"Mark at the ATT Store in Westpoint Village (Hwy46), New Braunfels was very kind and helpful switching my old phone over to one that was given to me.  NO hassle whatsoever.  I also appreciated that staff were taking appropriate protocols to maintain safety during the COVID epidemic.  I know ATT service gets slammed all the time but I was very happy with it.",2
"I was greatly satisficed with the outstanding service I was given during my visits to this Store. I found the staff agreeable, congenial, knowledgeable, and most important PATIENT. Being that I have visited the store many times, during purchasing and asking many perplex questions, for me anyway, the staff was entirely affable. Sonya, Christian, Stefany, and Kayla: these have all been my mentors are persons you will be acquainted with. Treat them well they deserve all your kindness and support.Keep up the great work!

"My wife and I needed to update our phones.  We went to the AT&T store at 835 Central Park Avenue in Scarsdale, NY.   The process takes some time, so we were able to observe several customer interactions witb the reps.  All were curteous, patient and helpful.  We want to give a special compliment to the rep who helped, Mazen Alkhouri.  He was just terrific.  We are seniors and like many of us, we are not technologically savvy.  He carefully and clearly explained everything.  We forgot our AARP card and had to go back home to get it.  When we returned he took up right where we left off.  At the end of the encounter he gave me his  mobile number and offered to give further help by texting.  Turned out that I was OK, but it was good to have him available.  The sales consultant job is stressful, but Mazen and his co-workers were unflappable, even in the face of some weird questions.  Way to go, everyone,  but especially Mazen.",2
"My experience signing over to at&t was a success and very easy. My representative Sheka  made it quicker than I expected, broke everything down simple, and had me in and out in Matter of 15 minutes. I’m loving the service, thank you!",2

He fixed my issues in a short time and it was a very nice experience I must say. Thanks again Victor.",2
I switched from Grande to AT&T and the customer service was outstanding. They were super nice in person and over phone. The tech that installed was super knowledgeable and answered all my questions. I just got internet and the sales rep was very clear on the pricing and my promotion so I know what to expect with billing.,2
"I have considered exploring other carriers but, considering the service I receive from the Wixom, Michigan store I plan on staying.  I have dealt with them before and have to say that they always fix my issues and take time explaining what I did or didn't do correctly Justin the manager has been there for sometime and is a pleasure to work with.  AT&T you might not be perfect for some people but, you are perfect for me.  ThanksBernie :)",2
"My experience today was more than great. The representatives all gave a warm welcome. Usually when walking into a workplace, people forget the values and ethics on how to greet a person, but not at this particular location. (Ridgeland, MS)Great services, pleasant attitudes, and providing knowledgeable and resourceful resources. Thank you Avery, Ashley, and D for helping me on today.",2
"Paul Drager is the best! Helped my whole family switch over from Sprint. Even though Sprint has been a nightmare, Paul has been patience and has definitely gone the extra mile to help me save money. Thank you AT&T for hiring dedicated, knowledgeable staff like Paul. We are happy to be with AT&T.Kristi R.",2
"I received courteous service with a lot of smiles, patience and understanding. It was a very pleasant experience with your knowledgeable personnel. The only problem I’ve found so far is that the charging cords I bought do not fit the new iPad which I must say was an unpleasant discovery since my other ATT devices use the former charger cords.The staff at the Borger Texas store are an asset to your company. Thank",2
"I've been struggling getting help with internet set up issues both online and in the AT&T store. Just talked to Paul from AT&T on the phone, he was incredibly friendly and helpful. Would definetly commend him on his general happy and positive attitude.",2
"***This is a ""customer service"" review regarding employee ""Justin"" @ AT&T in the Logan Valley Mall (5580 Goods Ln.) in Altoona, PA.Not knowing a lot about modern phone systems, I was having issues trying to re-up my ""Auto-Pay"" payment plan through AT&T.I ventured into the AT&T store at the Mall for some much needed assistance, but wasn't sure what to expect.After entering the store, a younger gentleman, Justin, approach me with a nice smile and, what seemed, a good attitude.  As we have been forced to do these days, I was skeptical at first of what was to come.Justin put me at ease, understood my problem and went right to work in a professional manor.  After 10 minutes of doing ""this and that"" he informed me I was GTG.  He even gave me his cell number to use if he wasn't available at the store and I needed his help/advise.  (Older folks, remember when this was the norm, the good attitude, the willingness to help and the problem solving solutions?)He was right on top of things!!!So, in summation, please keep Justin and folks like him on board within your company.  Though the days of ""customer service"" have fallen off dramatically over the last decade or so, it was a great experience meeting and dealing with Justin.  If/when I head back in to the AT&T store, I'll be searching for Justin!Many thanks for your help Justin.Pleased customer, john stoyanoff",2
"I would love to thank Wanda Steele at the Airport BLVD location in Mobile, AL for solving an issue created by and failed to solve by the main AT&T support, and Wanda took 3:55:00 less time resolving it. Wanda saved me from switching carriers and restored my faith in AT&T - she should be at their corporate offices training others. Thanks a million, Wanda, because you made it worth the 170 miles I drove to find you by chance: a true professional and problem solver 😁.",2
"I was traveling and needing a charging cable, I stopped at the ATT store in Lonoke, Arkansas.  I asked about Samsung phones. The young lady staff member provided me with more detailed and useful information in 10 minutes than the staff of 2 ATT stores in my hometown of Houston.  A truly knowledgeable and quality representative of a company with generally unhelpful staff.",2

James in the Spokane store was very helpful. Thank you leading me in the correct direction.,2
"My husband and I have been AT&T customers since August of last year. We traded in our phones at the AT&T store at the Oxford Commons in Oxford Alabama. We have been treated like crap by the store manager all the way down to the sales associates. We were lied to about how much we would pay for the new phones and they even lost one of the phones and said we never sent it in. Well they are right we never sent it in..... THEY SENT IT IN!!! And now I have proof. We were in Sylacauga Alabama today working and just happened into the AT&T store here in Sylacauga. Ashlee Dalton, the store manager, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to answer our questions and actually cared about our situation and helped us with our plan. We are so disappointed in the Oxford Store and will never go back to them for anything! We will be bringing our business to the Sylacauga store from now on, even though it’s an hour from our house, because they want to help instead of make the customer feel worse than when they walk in. A BIG Thank you to Ashlee Dalton!!!!!! Give this girl a raise because she deserves it!!!!! This should be the example for ALL of the AT&T stores.",2
"Employee Arielle was very helpful and she has helped me the last two times I have been there, I'm not very knowledgeable about cellphones,she has always answered any questions I have had and resolved my problems everytime,she is great!",2

"I must say, of it weren't for Eddie Mille #emistr, I woulda cancelled them Friday. He was so nice and helpful. I've been a good customer for many years and again, because of him, I did not go to Comcast. You have a great guy working for you!",2
"I would like to give special recognition of AT&T Lansing store employee Audrey.Store address: 3201 E. Grand River Ave. suite C Lansing, MI 48912I had a Wi-Fi technical difficulty issue that we’re not be able to be solved over the phone with AT&T customer service. So I talk to Audrey about my problem, she was on the phone continuously for almost 1 hour and 45 minutes and talked to multiple personnel to resolve my technical issue and ultimately found a good solution. I am very impressed with her customer service. Thanks for people like her made us very happy customers.",2
"I was looking into cell phone carriers.  I went into the Waterstone AT&T without an appointment and was very impressed with their care.  In particular, Tammy Pollen, was so helpful!  Our experience couldn't have been any better, and we are very grateful for her help. Thanks, Tammy!",2
"This review is specifically for the employee (ID # WW068E - Will). I switched my TV service from U-Verse to ATT-TV on 6/18/21. I started trying out with one cable box for a week and I liked it. So I went back to store and order three more boxes on 6/26/21. I received one box on 6/29/21. I went back to store a week after and explained them the situation regarding two more boxes were I never arrived. They called ATT customer service over the phone and I was told that they were shipping out more and I should be getting them in four days. I never received them. I went back to store two more times every week and nothing happened. So finally I decided to call ATT customer service from home myself. This is when I talked to Will and he understood everything what was going on in my situation. He assured me to help out as best as he can. He worked with me the whole time I was on the phone and he started the process right away. He told me that he'd call me back as soon as he confirmed my order. As he promised, he called back a couple of hours later and gave me all the information on the order. I received my two boxes the next day. Will is the kind of person customers like to work with and he is the one can keep the ATT customer service standard high. He deserves promotion or big raise for his good work.The previous three customer service before Will I got in touch with, either they are incompetent or lazy to do their job. They should be fired and hire more people like Will to rebuild ATT customer service.",2
Dean Daneshm was the most sweetest and compassionate and knowledgeable person ever.  I was very upset coming in because my car was broken into and used Assurian insurance to get a phone.  Dean was sooo patient and walked me through on set and kept assuring me that everything will be good.  Not okay - but good.  The kindness he showed - was beyond amazing.  Dean is tremendous at the Huntington Beach store - on Brookhurst and Adams.......,2
"I go to the AT&T store in Fenton, Mi. On Silver Lake Parkway. My husband & I have nothing but praise for this service we have received over the years. We would like to commend Kyle who helped me with an IPad problem that was urgent. There was a virtual baby shower going on for my niece & being my first time on Zoom, I was having trouble accessing the meeting. I quickly drove up to the AT&T store & even though it was closing Kyle opened the door & helped me with my problem.Needless to say, I was able to join my niece’s shower & I am very grateful to Kyle.Most recently, I could not find my IPhone & thought I lost in a local restaurant. I could notfind it anywhere at home. After searching for the phone & that included the restaurant, my husband & I drove to the AT& T store & Lance, the store manager , took charge of things & through a computer program was able to locate my phone which was tucked under a table.. I am so grateful. Thanks, Lance & Kyle,, you’re the best.",2
"I was recently provided exceptional customer care by Larnelle Dabney at AT&T. He was very kind, patient, understanding, helpful and he was just brilliant at his job, and he solved my issue with utmost professionalism. He should get a raise and be acknowledged as a valuable team member.",2
"I can't find where to put this so I guess here's fine, BUT AT&T GIVE MARK A RAISE PLEASE. This man went above and beyond to make sure we were takin care of. Including walking up our driveway when we forgot to open the gate for him, and helping to explain to me and my little sister how to set up the app, what the app looks like, etc. He was very kind the whole time he was here, even gave us his personal phone number for if we had any questions.",2
Jacoby Barber at the AT&T store in Morganton didn't give up until the issue I was having with my phone was resolved. He even stayed over passed his quitting time until my phone was back in service.  Thank you Jacoby!,2
"I have been trying to get assistance from the 800# customer service representative with absolutely no luck. I just kept going in circles when my issue should have been resolved the previous month. If there’s any day you feel you don’t have enough stress in your life then call the at&t 800# and try to get assistance. I ended up going to the AT&T store in Selmer, TN where Cody handled my issue quickly and professionally. I spent less time with Cody than on the phone with basically no stress. Now I am waiting to see if the account is credited correctly for the return of my previous phone. Overall, I think at&t needs to have someone like Cody train their telephone staff in how to handle customer issues. Great job, Cody!",2
I have a wonderful  experience at the Att in Tuscaloosa on 69.DJ and Tyler was exclent in helping with my needs.Good job guys!!,2
My mother and I went to the Ambassador Caffery location and received the best service from Andre. He went over and beyond trouble shooting her old phone and was very professional when he told her she needed a new one.  She did purchase a new phone and will definitely recommend anyone to this location and to ask for Andre.,2
"The customer service at the memorial store in Murfreesboro, Tn was excellent! Ti-ara was so helpful. She helped mutiple people while I was there and kept everything moving smoothly!",2
"Randy and David was the sweetest. I really like Randy. Hes a super star. Hes the nicest guy there. They were nice, kind, loving, patient, and caring. They were earnest and genuine. They worked hard. They weren't rude or anything. I had a pleasant experience.  A good experience at the att store.  The plans are affordable.  Great phones. Nice store. Convenient locations.  Friendly staff. Not too overpriced.  Not too cheap. Not much to complain about. I wouldn't go to any other carrier. I'm happy with att. The plans are great. I really like the phones. Compared to other cellular phones carrier I like att best. I've tried it all. They were either wack or overpriced and way too expensive.  Too costly. The monthly bills were astounding for other carriers. Show respect and you'll get respect. That's basic.",2
"We were at the Crossroads, Rochester, MN, store this afternoon and spent over two hours with Kenny Temple.  He was more than patient and helpful in pairing my hearing aids to my phone and making adjustments on the phone app.  In addition, he spoke to the audiologist and a hearing aid representative to get additional information.We were very pleased with his professionalism, determination, and honesty. He did not encourage me to purchase a new phone which would not have solved the problem.",2
I recently purchased a new phone from  your highway,2
"This is regarding a Retail Sales Consultant, Nicole S. Soto. As soon as I walked into the ATT store, I was greeted by this lovely young lady.  She went over and above her call of duty to assist me.  It was a pleasure dealing with Ms. Soto and believe she is definitely an asset to your company.",2
"I see all of these bad reviews about AT&T but the experience my fiancé and I had was very different from the other reviews. We went to the AT&T store in Fredericksburg, the one off of Carl D Silver Parkway..... Coty Hetrick was the one that took care of us! He was absolutely AMAZING!! If I could give him 10 STARS I WOULD!!! But I hope we don’t get any hidden charges like I heard happens to a lot of people so we will keep an eye on our bills but other than that great customer service thanks Coty for helping us with everything 👍✌️",2
"I am writing this review and rating it 5 stars based solely on David Thewis, retail sales consultant. David was the only employee that followed through to help me  get my money back after being told one thing about a phone upgrade deal and being charged an entirely different amount than promised. He was consistent and stuck to his word about doing all he could to help me get what I was promised. I have been with AT&T for at least 10 years and the ONLY reason I am staying with them at this time is because of this employee. He deserves a raise and recognition! In the future I will not be doing trade ins or upgrades without clear written statements. Thank you David.Jen",2
"I had some of the best customer service I’ve had anywhere at AT&T! I went to the Springfield OH location and Tyler G was Amazing! I’ve been a Verizon customer since I had my first phone and never thought about switching. But decided to stop by AT&T, and do not regret it.Tyler answers all my very complex questions and made sure to get me exact phone and plan I needed. He was professional and went above and beyond with service. I cannot thank him enough! Even though the whole process took less than 30 min, I really felt like family. If you want to switch or are looking to upgrade, Tyler is the man!Thanks a bunch!",2
"We are very limited with what internet provider we can get where we live. But we signed up for AT&T and the next morning, Anthony came by the house to hook up a wire for our modem. He climbed the pole across the street and on our property and brought it to the house within probably an hour and at no charge. Xfinity wanted to charge us $700 to do the exact same thing. The tech was very nice and explained everything and he left us his contact info in case we have any further questions. Very good service, so far!",2
"I needed a technical support re my email on my phone and I came to the Midway/ Tamiami store to get my email working.After a friendly greeting an office manager ,Nick ,assisted me and he was very kind and understanding (I am an older person)I couldn’t be happier with the service. I highly recommend ATT and their staff .",2

"My husband and I went to the ATT store on Bardstown rd on April 21 to upgrade our phones. It took longer than expected but that’s okay, Emily took good care of us. She knew her stuff! Even worked through her lunch to help us. So glad we came to this location, thank you Emily, you’re the best !",2

"Had a very good experience with Richie at AT&T Ashtabula Ohio store. Very knowledgeable,very patient and professional. He handled all our needs while waiting on others in between. He is very good at his job. Thank you Richie.",2
Awful company! I have been a long time customer and they don't care. They will use misleading information to suck you in and charge you for something you didn't know you were getting. There online deals are a lie! They are not clear or accurate. Do not trust this company. They will steal your money by offering a deal and then taking it away!UPDATE- Att has contacted me after this experience and has been wonderful in resolving this issue! There was some confusion and they have made it right. Thank you very much! Christina was so kind and helpful. Some of the best customer service I have had in awhile. I will be staying with this company.,2
"Visited AT&T store on New York Street Aurora, IL.  Dealt with a Consultant named Mirza Orozco.  She was unbelievable at her job and went above and beyond to satisfy my issues.  I have transferred over 4 lines and know if I have any issues who to call.",2
Nicholas was great excelent customer service had a wonder full experiance,2
"Today, March 8th, I called At&t to stop my service at 8:35 PM and was not looking forward to my call after my previous interaction with a customer service agent was abrasive and largely unhelpful. I was left on hold for a long time, which I understand on a Monday call volume much be high, but this still did not contribute to a great experience. Then, the customer service agent who answered immediately made my experience a great one! She was so kind, clear, and was very intent on making sure that not only was my concern being taken care of but that I was having a positive customer experience. She was so informative, and was incredibly warm, empathetic and friendly. My service request was taken care of quickly, and she let me know exactly how to do the next steps. I think that the rest of the team could definitely be taking some lessons from her!",2
AT&T is one of the best service phone places out here there customer service is great and welling to help you with any problem that you may have on seller device.,2
"I went to the Arlington Branch again after leaving out the first time. My new phone Contact list had not downloaded by the time I reached home. I had to return to the store to have that added. Once again the staff, especially Charles was very helpful. I appreciate the experience I’ve had at this Branch.",2
"Cody at the Bluemound Rd. Waukesha, Wisconsin store provided amazing customer service for my mother, today. We recently switched from Verizon to AT &T.  To date, most of our experience has not been positive.The transition has required a lot of hours between my son first making the switch, to bringing me and my other son and parents onto AT & T.  It seems either the sales people in Stuart, Florida (where my son and I live) didn’t set things up properly (after hours of us spending time with them in the store) or the transfer process is not properly communicated to all AT & T staff.  Not only did my son (who is the account holder) spend 8+ hours between the Stuart store and corporate (on the phone) setting up his service and straightening out charges to his account, but my other son and I spent 3+ hours at the Stuart store only to spend another 2 hours on the phone the next day finding out the “porting” didn’t work properly; then my mom (in Wisconsin) had several difficulties setting up my dad’s new phone that we bought in Stuart and had shipped to him in Wisconsin.Our phone charges are a mess; very difficult to determine if we were ultimately charged appropriately (we’re still trying to figure it out).Now today, my mom (who is the only one who kept her “new” phone purchased thru Verizon before knowing we would be transitioning service to AT&T) all of a sudden could not make calls or receive calls.  I tried (from Florida) to help her figure out the problem, but had no luck.  We called her Waukesha store and Cody took our call.  He offered a solution that wouldn’t work for my mom.   He told my mom he could definitely help her with her SIM failure if she came to the store; which she did.  Cody found the problem and fixed it within minutes!I called to personally thank Cody.  I explained to him that my parents no longer have a landline phone, so they rely on their cell phones.  My dad’s health is very poor and he is not very mobile.  So, when he needs my mom’s assistance, he HAS to be able to reach her.  Today, he needed my mom and she was at the store running errands.  He couldn’t reach her by phone, so he texted “HELP!”  Imagine how scary that was for them both?  It is imperative that my parents have reliable phones and phone service.Cody’s assistance today was extremely valuable.  I hope his manager and superiors see this post.  There is definitely room for improvement for the company to make the transition process from another cell phone service to AT & T a more seamless and less time consuming one.  The consumer’s time is just as valuable as the company’s time.Cody, thank you, again, for restoring my mom’s ability to make and receive calls.  You are much appreciated!",2
"We have AT&T for internet and cable only. Recently we have had several strange issues with the hardware, and they have made it so easy to get help. For a few issues, as soon as I call their help number a computer does a test on my services and then quickly diagnoses it and allows me to schedule a tech visit for the next day. If the computer doesn't find anything wrong, it immediately connects me to a person who was so helpful. In an age where it seems increasingly hard to get help, their customer service is outstanding!",2
"Deshawnta Houston at the Florissant,MO AT&T store is a rock star!!! I recently transferred phone and tv services at a Sam’s wholesale to AT&T and they screwed up everything. I had to take it in to the AT&T store and Deshawnta went above and beyond to help my situation. Everything was resolved but when I canceled my directTV apparently the online customer service rep canceled EVERYTHING. I gave Deshawnta a call, told her what happened and she dropped everything to assist me once again. She was pleasant, patient, knowledgeable, and immensely helpful with my situation. Had it not been for her I would’ve canceled everything and gone back to my old services. I’m still dealing with the loss of AT&T TV, but she’s helping me out.",2
"Today, I contacted ATT about being billed for my damaged IPhone ( $1049.00). I had returned the phone in late December 2020 and they apparently never received it. ATT ProTech was very understanding and began research.  He referred me to the warranty department and said they could research the USPS tracking number.  At this point, I talked to Victoria, based in Texas.  She was super helpful and courteous. She apologized for putting me on hold and began her research. Victoria located the tracking number and found out the package has been lost in transit. After talking to her supervisor, she arranged to have the amount credited to my account, since it wasn’t my fault the package was lost.  The excellent care and concern  Victoria gave to my issue made my day!",2
"Recently we needed to upgrade one of our phones and review the options for our phone plan that included 5 phones plus we wanted to add another phone line. We made an appointment at the AT&T Park Avenue store in Little Rock, Blake was our tech. Blake was amazing! We had lots of questions, Blake was patient when we didn't understand, and kept going over everything until we understood all the details. It was a great experience, we would recommend AT&T and Blake to anyone.  We've been with AT&T for thirteen years and have always had this type of attention and care not only from Blake but any of the tech's we've  worked with over the years.",2
"Sending out thanks and appreciation for the outstanding services I received from the employees from the AT&T store at 217 Broadway, New York, New York.

"As a 20 year customer of Comcast and having become tired of their lack of customer service, I made the decision to switch to ATT. We are at the border of their service area but were assured that they could adequately provide coverage. At first, that was not the case but one call was all it took to get the problem looked at and then, very quickly, fixed at no cost to us. I could not be happier with the product and the service.",2
I was recently at the Cape Coral store on Santa Barbara Blvd.. I took my elderly neighbor there to replace his phone. Carlie was the person who helped us.

Amazing experience! Kristen Chorn is the best att has to offer she is #1! The amount of enthusiasm and positivity she has is next level. The amount of professionalism she welcomed me with was highly appreciated. I really want to thank her for solving my issue with a trade in. The promptness and kindness presented was incredible. Att give her a huge promo she deserves it. The best this site has to offer in customer service I’ve spoken to many representatives but what she has done and the kindness was next level as I said ; Kristen Chorn #1 in customer satisfaction (should be awarded with this).,2
"On Dec. 25th my service went down right in the middle of a Lyft ride!  The bomb that blew up in Nashville caused the shut down of ALL AT&T services.  I was in a panic the next day because I needed to make money to pay my bills & rent!!  I went to the S. Church St. location & found out from Julian, Retail Sales Consultant what happened.  He explained everything to me as several other costumers were coming in to the store angry wanting to cancel!  It was such a horrible disaster!  I stayed calm, listened to other costumers complaints/issues and decided to go to Wal-Mart to buy a Straight Talk phone so I could get driving for Lyft & Uber.  Well, now the real drama begins for me! After the craziness @ Wal-Mart with all the AT&T customers buying all their phones, waiting in line for hours & trying to get my Lyft & Uber accounts on my new phone, I decided to go back to Julian @ AT&T for help.  I brought my laptop & new Straight Talk phone to seek help.  I connected to the WIFI next door @ Dunkin Donuts and attempted to get my new phone number connected to my Lyft & Uber accounts.  After the hours of endless drama that ended around 3pm, I was able to get on the road driving for Lyft & Uber to make money!  This whole process began at 10am @ the AT&T store and ended their @3pm!!  Thanks to Julian helping me figure this out, I made enough money to cover my rent!  I will forever be grateful for the service & help that he gave me that day!",2
"I spoke with Jayd today over the phone to help me with my login issues and autopay card change to my at&t prepaid account.Jayd was very nice and helped me fix everything.  She did not try to sell me other stuff in the middle of fixing my account issues, and I thank her abundantly because when they try to sell additional stuff while fixing your issues, it gets confusing and more mistakes to happen.If you get Jayd on the phone, you are in good hands at at&t prepaid!Julz McN.January 18, 2021",2
Phone service works great. Been using them for many years,2
"I had trouble with my bill being too high and was given "" DELANO"" was my rep that helped me get thing  fixed and helped me with other problems. Delano was the best and helpful rep I have EVER had in all the years that I have been with at At&t. He was so kind and helpful and told me just calm down I here to help you.("" I get anxiety when I don't know what exactly what I am doing."") He kept calming me down and told me I won't leave you. He deserves a raise and promotion. If I could get Delano every time I called for help .I would stay with At&t for ever. Please help him with some kind of of raise or promotion. He is one of you BEST.  Thank you, Patti Johnstone",2
"I was anxious at first to get my iPhone 12 Pro set up. Brian and the other employees were kind, knowledgeable and eager to please. Thank you AT&T Boylston St. for helping, teaching, and assisting me. Highly recommend that store!",2
"I WORKED WITH ATT!!! and here's the tip whenever you call for promotion discount or any to lower your bill take it from me, call the customer service and here what exactly you gonna say  ""I WANT TO CANCEL MY SERVICE UNLESS YOU HAVE BETTER DEAL"" thats magic word for them and u know what? They will transfer the call immedietly to the higher person which is loyalty that really do promotion, and just in case they dont have anything for you either? If you have contract finish it so you wont pay etf but if you dont, feel free to cancel the service and then call again after the effectivity of cancellation, place new order so you can enjoy new benefits again.Its funny, people thought if they are loyal to company, theyll have much better price, well yeah like 5% maybe and most of them just using dial up landline lol, so you folks must know how it really works, its not what you think it is, like c'mon! its business, i have worked with spectrum and verizon they do the same, it just that i stayed long with att cuz believe or not, there are more satisfied customer than them.( its true less stress when handling calls)And last thing! Always be kind to all representative, they can do much better unless you are stupid.",2
"It took 4 months but with hard work and dedication, I was able to get my specific business number activated. It wasn't any of the 5 reps that talked too about this, it was the last guy I talked to (forgot his name). The only reason I left a 5 star is because ATT was finally able to activate the number I specifically wanted : )",2
"Love it!! We have had their cell phone & home high speed internet wifi service for over a year. Just recently two hurricanes Laura and Delta hit us and took all cell towers down. Nobody had cell service, internet access, or cable for over a month. Low and behold my husband never lost cell service and we were the only people in the area that had wifi. That wifi saved us! It allowed us to keep in touch & let everyone we were alive & ok. Plus get all the info we needed to survive at that time to find food, water, etc.. I want to say Thank You!! You literally saved us with your dependable service! Not sure what wouldve happened if we wouldnt have had your service. It didnt just help us, it helped others in my community too since we were the some of the only ones with service. Our family and friends are grateful.",2
"On 27 December 2020, my mom and I went to the AT&T store located at 5705 Centennial Center Blvd, Suite 110, location in Las Vegas.  We were fortunate to have Juan Campos Ortiz assist us.  I needed a new sim card installed due to a mishap with my account.  Juan read the notes in the file, replaced the sim card, informed us of new AT&T Offers.  I asked how to transfer my photos to a thumb drive.  He didn't look at me like I was crazy. He politely answered my question and even asked if I had other questions or concerns.  He was polite, knowledgeable, and professional.  I can't say that about the location on Durango.  This is now my location.  Thanks Juan.",2
Rod and Devan helped us and we’re very helpful!,2

I had a hard time getting  my internet hooked up. Robert Davis came out to my townhouse  in Cumming ga in a timely fashion. The thing i like the most about Robert is he called when he was on the way and showed up early and got my internet fixed. Not only did he get my internet working but he went the extra mile and got my tv connected to the internet.Anyone in the area should ask for Robert Davis to come to your home to get your service hooked up.,2
I recently visited Bastrop Texas 78612 location for a Hot Spot issue. The device stopped working and it was under warranty. Initially there was issues but the manager Tony Leon took charge and turned the problems around. I have been with AT&T for over 30 years and I did not want to end my relationship. Mr. Leon went beyond the call of duty and corrected the issues. What a Great manager! I am so glad I am with AT&T. Thanks Tony,2

"Christina, who goes by Tina, was absolutely AMAZING. She answered all of my questions after I was extremely frustrated (and not quite friendly) at first after my experience in the Galloway NJ store. She spent 40 minutes with me listening to my concerns and answering every question I had that would benefit me. She took care of all of my problems and even discussed my current plan to help me find something affordable as I expressed my concerns as a college student. This is how you do customer service. I can’t even thank her enough and because of her, I will stay with AT&T. If it wasn’t for her, I would have turned my phone in and switched plans. She is AMAZING!!!!",2
"I had to make a call this morning to inquire about the access program you offer.I was warmly greeted by a lady named Geraldine. She was very informative and so polite and respectful. She is a prime example of how customer service should be and one of the best I've ever spoken to. I hope At&t treats exemplary employees like her as they should, like gold ! You are lucky to have her !",2
"I recently purchased a new galaxy phone and I needed help transferring all my data over from the old galaxy.  Long story short I stopped in the retail store on 10/8/20 at 7372 two notch rd, Columbia, SC around 1245pm before work.  I met the two salesmen who were there and they were so knowledgeable and helpful the whole time.  I heard one of their names.  It was Travis.  I did not catch the other one's name unfortunately, but he took the lead from the jump, showing me how to transfer all my files and making sure everything worked before I left.  Travis was helpful too. Even when the transfer failed the first time, he reset it and tried again until it worked.  I have been a customer of ATT since 2008.  I have never had any problems with them and their customer service is outstanding.  Thank you Travis and the other kind gentlemen!  My phone is working great!",2
"I had issue related to my at&t data and Nicholas (KHK7DC6) has made sure I got the required support and instruction. He has called back when my phone got disconnected in the middle of troubleshooting session. I greatly appriciate the customer service I got from, Nicholas! Thank you.",2

I want to compliment Victoria Phillips Metcalfe at the Richmond Hill GA store. She was very helpful and professional! Thanks for the smooth transition of trading in the old phone and buying my daughters new phone.  Cathy Kee,2
"After my ordeal with Sprint I transferred my two lines to AT&T.  Anthony and his team located on Boston Rd in Springfield, MA, are amazing.I walked in and in the course of 30 minutes he transferred my lines from Sprint.  This is my review of Sprint and how unprofessional they are and how Anthony and his team fixed my problem.#I1998543450We have had lines with sprint for over 13 years.  At the end a total of 5 lines.  i called to separate 2 lines and what should have taken 15 minutes took over 2 hours to do.  Completely uneducated agents/representatives/supervisors/managers.  I was not able to respond to my clients which i do over the phone.  I lost clients/business.  I then called to complain and was transferred to more unprofessional/uneducated supervisors/managers that claimed they could do nothing for me.  This escalated to over 7 hours in the course of 3 days of wasted time and energy and lost clients/business.  I finally had the pleasure of speaking with Chenn, a representative that clearly knew what she was doing.  She unlocked the phone and refunded my pay off to the locked phone which i gladly paid in order to transfer my lines to AT&T that same day.  That is what i did.  This was completely unprofessional.  Pathetic.  Highly recommend to not use this company.  Chenn was amazing.  That is the only god thing i have to say.  She needs a raise and she should be training Sprint's supervisors/managers.",2
Went to my local At&t store and Erica Gonzalez answered all my questions. Great employee. Will highly recommend Erica.,2

I was pleased from my experience in the US,2
"Patrick Pichon with the Beglis - Sulphur, Louisiana Office has gone upon and beyond any representative I have every encountered.  Not only did he earn my personal but complete company business.  He assisted two of my employees and two of my current tenants with their conversion and/or AT&T services.  He answered his phone and/or returned my call immediately when available to assist.  I must say even on his day off due to bereavement of his own mom unknown to me at the time of call he assisted me and one of my employees.  Cheers to such a very dedicated employee.",2
"I’m trying to figure why so many morans are giving AT&T bad reviews. I’ve been a loyal customer for  decades and I have never had any issues with my cellphone. Works every time. Data , internet, etc. super fast . If they pay their bill on time then maybe they wouldn’t have any problems. AT&T is not cheap but they sure are worth every dime. Pay your bill and stop crying  crybabies.",2
"I absolutely love the service I have received from AT&T. I have cable and internet service. I recently switched my cell phone carrier to AT&T as well. The customer service I received is phenomenal!

"I encountered spectacular customer care today when trying to migrate from ""traditional"" AT&T ""Postpaid"" Wireless to the less-expensive AT&T ""Prepaid"" Wireless and migrate 3 existing phone lines.  A woman out in Georgia named ""Via"" went far beyond my expectations and kept after the problem for over 2 1/2 hours- long after other AT&T employees gave up or 'dropped the ball'.  She works in the Loyalty department, and even though I was ""leaving"" the 'traditional' side of the company, at no time was she in any way rude, negative or unpleasant.  In fact she tirelessly attacked the problem and REFUSED to give up.  I will write directly to the president of the company and give my applause and appreciation.  Truly exceptional service.  Even though it took a lot of time to complete - Via was willing to stay beyond her 'official end of shift' to see me succeed.  That was incredibly generous of her and much-appreciated!",2
"great service ,very patient w me and they understand the frustrations of getting good service..",2
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Parker AT&T location. Warren and Deven both helped me out until all my needs were met. I love my new phone :),2
My name is JW I live in Guthrie  OKLAHOMA. I go to the AT&T store to pay my Internet bill and my phone bill. When I go to the AT&T store I make sure Billy is working because knows what he is doing when it comes to the AT&T phones and the paying your bill process.I payed my bill one month and the next time I went to pay my bill AT&T said i had not payed my bill. Billy got on the phone with them and stayed on the phone almost two hours until he got things fixed. They have messed up my bill more than once and he always knows how to fix it. If it was not for Billy I would have left AT&T and went to another phone company.Billy always has a good attitude when i come into the store. He needs to be paid more money or he should be a manager of a store to teach other employees how to treat customers .I was in the store a week ago and Billys boss was in the store with him and my bill was f up again Billy and his boss fixed it she was wonderful also seeing how i was mad and not happy.I have been with AT&T for a long time and there have bee other people work in that store who did not know what the hell they were doing and treated me like I was wasting there time. Billy IS THE MAN THANKS BILLY FOR ALL YOU DO.,2

"It has been quite some time since we have had BAD static on our 3 landline phones, even though we have cell phones as well.  I keep the landline phone because of hearing problems, and I have a machine that gives details when someone calls in to help, as well.  The static on our phone has been bad for 6 months or longer, and even people leaving messages on the landline phone, we could hear nothing of what they were saying, or even to call out on the phones. I decided after all this time that I have been paying the AT&T bill, we needed to find out why there was so much static on our phone all the time.  I made the call today, and within 30 minutes, Craig McMillin (I ask his name, but I'm not for sure of the correct spelling of the last name, but I believe he has worked for the company for several years) arrived, (I also received a text that he was on his way and the time period) after calling and confirming the correct address of where we lived. When arriving he told me his name and who he was with.  After telling him that we were having BAD static on all 3 landline phones, he went to each phone to check them out, etc. Then he run test on them. Even though he left some of them unplugged, he told me before he left, he would put everything back the way it was.  After checking the 3 landline phones, he could not find any problem, but the static was still there.  He checked outside of the house, and could see that the wires were leading to our ""craw space"" basement.  I really hated to have him look there, (we have had a lot of water in this area because of all the rain, and we have been trying to drain it out) but he told me he was checking ""every"" area, to try to ""pinpoint"" where the problem was.  To make the long story short, he FOUND the problem in our craw space, and was able to FIX the problem.  Craig was very personal and nice, and I would recommend him checking out anyone's problem, as he is very thorough!",2
Just had a great experience at at and t here in Milwaukee Wisconsin!thanks to Jeanette ! She was so kind and upbeat and friendly even in these trying times!! Great attitude and even better  service!!

I had a great experience at the Att&t location at 1016 Gessner. My representative was the best. He explained everything to me and made me feel like I was important  I love the help I received,2
Ben Lide was our technician for our Internet. He was amazing! He got there early and made me feel at ease knowing that he had some other things to get done before he needed to go inside which was good because my husband was on his way there. He was very nice and professional. He even vacuumed up the mess he made. My husband was wanting fast internet in his office and Ben definitely helped make that possible.,2

I want to give a great big thank you to Jeff at the Campbellsville store in Kentucky for his wonderful customer service and his knowledge in his profession .

"Washington Indiana rocks! We live closer to anther store but prefer this one. I ran in at lunch, worried about my husbands phone not charging and the cost of a new phone. After Alex listened to the problem we were having he then let me know that he was sure he knew what the problem was. I'm embarrassed.  The port was full of pocket lint. He saved me lots of money and was so friendly and helpful.  He did have to take the time and trouble shoot an older phone.  He could have easily made a commission but he shoes customer service over money.  I can't thank him enough!  Well done AT & T.   We always have great service at this store!",2
"Review AT&T Store on West 11th, Eugene, OregonManager Richard went out of his way to save the day for my 92 year old mother.  She had purchased a phone charger from the Valley River AT&T store the previous week and then they refused to let her return it because she had no receipt.  They claimed that they were unable to go back more than 72 hours to look up a previous purchase on their system.  I called the West 11th store and talked to Richard.  He first told me that the Valley River store should be able to find the receipt on their system and since she bought it there, it would be best to return it there.  But then Richard did some research on his own initiative, called my mother and said he found her receipt by going into the system.  He told my mother to come in to his store on West 11th and he would refund her money.  30 minutes later, all solved.  Richard then called me to say everything was taken care of.  Now That's Customer Service. WOW!My mother visited the Valley River Store multiple times to solve this problem and only received frustration and anger from the experience.  Richard solved everything in an hour from one phone call.If you want to do business with AT&T in Eugene - do it at the West 11th Store.  Avoid the Valley River experience.",2
"I was on the phone with Lori Lee(Rome, GA).  She was helping me with a business account.   AT&T needs to acknowledge her service to them everyday.  She was patient, respectful and very knowledge.   She dedicated herself to assisting me and worked magic with resolving my issue.  In a world where most customer service is just a recording with prompts, I would like to commend Lori Lee for being one of the best at her job",2
"I endured a Serious Issue. I received a bill from AT&T. The envelope had My Name imprinted on it along with My Full Address. I opened the bill, and read through an influx of pages; wth imprint on both sides. The Charges were erroneous, The Phone Number on the Account, was Not My Own and had Services; Such as Wi-Fi, That I Most Assuredly, Did Not Select.I phoned the Customer Service Number for AT&T; Waited a few Short Minutes, until a Representative came on. I explained to the Representative, That I received an Erroneous  Bill, etc; However, She was determined to prove Me wrong. I thought to Myself, Prove Me wrong, When I just told You; The Phone Number on this Account is Not My Own.  I was asked to go into various applications; One of which denied me access, after numerous attempts, encouraged by The Representative. I was trying so hard to access them , But could not.Time was of an essence and eventually Her Supervisor told her, She was on the call too long;I felt bad for her. The Supervisor took the call. He never asked Me, What the problem was. He apologized and told Me, He would phone Me back in approximately 4 to 5 minutes, But did Not.I was Totally disgusted and after, an hour had passed; I decided to redial Customer Service at AT&T. I'm So Grateful to ⚡""OUR HEAVENLY FATHER""⚡, That I did. Representative Robert of AT&T Atlanta, Georgia answered My Call. I briefly gave him a synopsis of that, which occurred earlier. Representative Robert of AT&T, Asked Me a few Key Questions and within 3 Minutes, My Issue was resolved! That Representative is a Prime Example of a Good Listener, Patience of Job, Inarguably Accurate and Prompt in His Theory and Totally Consummate!Thank You AT&T, For Hiring an Energetic and Noble Employee!",2
"I was connected with customer service right away after the tech thing was having a hard time with helping me out. Kent was a pretty rad dude. He used my real name when addressing me after he asked for it and tried to be as helpful as he could with the little information I had. Very friendly dude and laughed along with me when I realized I was giving him my iCloud password, not the AT&T one. I have crippling anxiety when I call people and Kent made me feel at ease and it was a good experience for me, especially since he spoke loudly and clearly since I can never understand what people are saying over the phone. For everyone complaining, just know that there's always a silver lining somewhere. Kent, if you're out there, just know that you're a nice man and you made me happy with my phone experience (for once.)",2
Best company ever . And oh my god Addison he s a good customer service. He has answers for all questions. And he’s really nice really professional. Wathever problem you have he s gonna resolve it. Good job you need people like this in your enterprise.,2
Best cell phone service in South Florida. Anyone who says different can’t afford AT&T. I have been with them for over 15 years and would not even consider another company. They always take care of their good customers.,2

"I went to the att store and I was told by an att rep there that if I purchased the BOGO iPhone 10 that I could do whatever I wanted with the phone because it was mine. This was a lie and he lied about dropping the line and about adding security to the previous phone that needed to be checked out.  Anyway, the people at the store said that they couldn’t help me but they would make a note of our conversation and suggested I call the loyalty line.  He also told me the person who told me all of this crap was fired!!!So, I called the att loyalty line and I was connected with this lovely lady, Jennifer from GA.  She listened and she was able to lower my bill.  The only reason I purchased the phone to begin with was to sell one iphone to pay for the other.  Otherwise, I wouldn’t have purchased it at all since I am on a fixed income.  I knew they wouldn’t refund the money for the iphone 10 but I was hoping they would at least let me get rid of the extra line I had to purchase in order to get the phone.  Jennifer from GA took care of me and she was able to lower my bill.  She exceeded my expectations and went over and beyond to help me.  She was so sweet and willing to help me anyway she could!!  I’m thankful for people like Jennifer (from GA), who go out of their way to help others!!  I hope the powers that be recognize her service and realize what an asset she is to the company!!  Please give her the proper recognition and raise she deserves!!  Also, please make it easier on your website to leave feedback about customer service.  Thanks!!",2
"I was having a really bad experience with customer service, and was almost ready to dismiss At&t all in one until I met Brad Reid. He works in the in home expert department and came out with the technician that was installing Direct TV. I openly spoke with him about my new services and devices that never came to my house. Brad explained everything to me and spent hours helping to resolve the issue. Finally, after all the frustration,  he set me up with new services with a great deal. He set up all of my devices and now we are back in service. He went far and beyond to help us. He also kept In contact with us every step of the way through emails,  calling, leaving voice messages etc. I was going to go to with another company but his excellent customer service skills made me change my mind. We are extremely happy. Thanks so much for all of your help and excellent work ethics Brad. Excellent customer service skills makes all of the difference.  Hopefully,  higher ups see this and give you recognition,  because you absolutely did the damn thing......🙂",2
"I am sharing about the BEST girl and hardest worker, Lindsay Maria. She is over the franklin road store in Brentwood, TN. She overheard me talking to her coworker about issues I was having with my bill seeming unusually high.  She went ahead and checked it out on her end and found quadruple charges for my plan that had been made years ago. Before she even found out about that, she offered me the same plan I have that now is at a $24 below difference a month. She went OUT of her way to rally for me in customer service. I cannot say enough good things about this girl. I have been in the business world for years, but this girl has natural relationship building skills and a high emotional intelligence. She was able to validate my feelings, be proactive, and cheer me on! This girl needs to move up quickly! She is invaluable and ATT is lucky to have her helping customers!​Best,Courtney Shake",2

"Lyric Kennedy at the Eunice, Louisiana at&t is one of the most helpful customer service representatives in there. No matter if she’s having a good or bad day she always greets her customers with a smile.

I highly appreciated her services and I also recommend everybody to ask for her!!!",2

Yes, we’ve had some issues in the past, but my husband and I just went and purchased a new phone and a new Apple Watch for our twin sixteen year old girls this past week in Altamont Florida. The manager Steve Shapiro was honest, extremely helpful, did what was best for our family, and Did not try to sell us a bunch of stuff that he knew good and well we did not need. We already have eight lines, so you can say were dedicated customers. Steve Schapiro, the manager at AT&T, in Altamont Florida is hands-down the only reason why I will continue to stay with AT&T. I will forever be grateful for Steve and him reminding my husband and I that there are still good human beings in the world. Not to mention the sales industry. So, if you want to say you’ve had a bad time or two or three or four with AT&T, I understand, but go to Altamonte Springs and visit Steve. He will restore Your faith in humanity again. Not to mention my bill came down about $200 LOL sometimes money isn’t everything. Thank you Steve, Amanda and Wes Clearman",2
My wait was longer than I expected. Our service was great though. I thought it was awesome that they were doing a toy drive.,2
"I now realize that you can not always go by reviews people have written. We just had fiber internet installed by James Bledsoe. He not only did a great job, he was very pleasant to work with. The job, which took about 5 hrs. was not easy. James worked none stop. I hope a supervisor at AT&T reads this and gives James the credit he deserves. Thanks for your help James!",2
The worst company in the US. Horrible!!They don't have any customer service skills . Offshore is not trained on addressing needs of the customer. why are they in business!!,2
"Beware ATT did a bait and switch on my Uverse plan ! In April I signed up for a plan with unlimited data and 1000 speed, yes it was more speed than most would need but it was the special. In October I looked at my plan online I was getting 300s speed and a cap on my data use. My bill went from $ 50 to $ 70. When I called ATT they told me the system stopped my plan in error and they could not change it back. I spoke with a manager as well as the loyalty department. I have cancelled my service and will never do business with ATT again. I will be filing a complaint with the FCC.",2
Madison  Copley  in Jacksonville tx is a very good customer service  rep she does  her job and deserves  more recognition,2
"Absolutely fantastic! Jason came out to help install and, due to the wiring in our apt, it took awhile to find the correct outlets (ended up being in our CRAWLSPACE!?) But he was so patient and helpful and kind really going above and beyond to make sure things got set up so I could have the level of coverage needed to qualify for work from home. Truly amazing guy, I honestly can't speak highly enough to him. He kept trying long after I suspect most would have given up. Huge THANK YOU to AT&T for the coverage at the right price, and more importantly for having such an amazing guy on your team. Thank you Jason!!!",2
"I chated with a gentleman named Andrew this evening and was seeing what was available in area I recently move to.although the phone service was available and DirecTV,  the other television service I was trying to get was not available. He walked me through every step my was was very happy to get her nfl network back with Direct TV.I recommend very highly of AT&T to all my friends and coworkers",2
"This review is for one individual who works at ATT store in Merriam,  Kansas. His name is John. He gets 5 stars, not the company. I have never encountered such horrific customer service in my life.  You can never get the correct dept when you call and you get transferred all over the place and then if you are lucky enough not to get cut off you have to repeat yourself. It is not unusual for me to go thru 6 to 8 agents, all giving different answers and never resolving the problem.  My tablet stopped working less than 2cmonths from purchase date, I called customer service and was sent all over the place for warranty info. Finally 2 hours later and 6 agents later I was told I would get my shipping label within a few days. One week no label. I took my tablet to the store and John was awesome. He called and of course they wanted to transfer him and have him repeat himself, he said no. You can do this and agent said it wasn't his job. John got him to do it anyway. I got my shipping label emailed and John gave me a return box and will credit me from when tablet broke until I get it back. All this and this is not his job. He went above and beyondTo top it off customer service told him I did not get my label in the mail because THEY COULD NOT FIND ANOTHER SAMSUNG TABLET TO SEND ME,  If Spectrum could buy my contract for phone and tablet I would stop ATTI did get rid of cable and internet. Again this 5 star review is for John at Merriam, Ks store not ATT ....they are worse than any company could be",2
"I felt compelled to share this experience and write a review regarding my recent over the phone customer service experience. It was the most highly efficient, compassionate, friendly and heart-warming billing dispute concern that was immediately acted upon. Special mention to April! You dear is such an angel! 😇",2
"These people are God sent seriously! They work with you the best they can and they  are very helpful in fixing my postpaid They go the extra mile. I feel a whole weight off my shoulders I'm more than satisfied with the service cyber.surgeon  provided i was so surprised when i got a mail from my service provider that my postpaid bills has reduce from $176 to $70 i will have to be paying $70 every month this was huge and relief i don't have to use half of mu check to pay my phone bills again . I will definitely  recommending my peeps to these services. Super, fast and very ambitious about getting the help you need to contact: c y b e r.s u r g e o n at outlook.c o m",2
"Stephanie, Odessa, Texas store, was AMAZING! Extremely helpful, knowledgable and friendly.  Took the time to explain options and answered questions.  Would defintely go back to see her and recommend to all.",2
"I have to give a shout out to ""Aislin"" my representative that helped me 110%..she obligated her time in full force to assist my needs and concerns!! After the love and support she gave i will strongly suggest at-n-ts services to any and everyone! They are very understanding and will be by your side!Thanks, Aaron",2
"Awful awful awful coverage in Denver and surrounding suburbs. Avoid especially if you are a ridesharer, will cut into your profits. Go with Verizon",2
"I called at&t service regarding the red blank dot on voicemail which made it impossible to retrieve any messages. The female representative suggested sending me a new phone to replace the defected one. Without my consent, the representative added a new line to my account which overcharged me $169 for it. I called customer service again and they kept transferring me between fraud department and loyalty department. I was going back and forth for about 3 hours and finally, I got to talk to David and Will. when I told them my story, they immediately knew what was going on and resolved the issue within an hour. Their service is exceptionally awesome. They showed empathy for what I was going through and understood the frustration from a customer point of view. If it wasn't for them, I would completely lose trust in at&t service regarding what happened with the first representative. Thanks so much for your help David and Will.",2
I left my phone at AT&T in Lockport Illinois with Nicole who's the manager. I had 48 updates that had to be done and she did a great jov. She even charged it for me. Thank you Nicole,2
Received my new device for internet service.  Helpful and courteous staff to explain and follow up on service.  Dependable products including other online purchase in previous transaction.,2
"They were very helpful,and prompt .good customer service",2
"I went to the Brentwood store to change from a prepaid cell company to a AT&T cell plan. The representative that worked with me was Chris. He was very professional and patient. He explained the process and executed as quickly as possible. I left the store happy. However, the next day, I had to go back- no fault to Chris-my error! This time I worked with Wendy. Again, Wendy showed the same professionalism and patience to correct my error. I left the store happy.",2
"Ordered 100 meg fiber internet from ATT a few months ago.  Service rep was knowledgeable and polite, tech showed up on time to install and I am getting 125 meg up and down, very happy with the service.  Am using it to stream tv.",2
"I have been with AT&T since I first saw their trucks enter my area...could hardly wait !   I have had only 2 problems in 10 years... and the first problem wasn't even AT&T's fault... a city employee accidently cut the cable while placing a sign... oh my.   This second time...  I was repaired within 48 hours by a young man who has worked for AT&T for 22 years named Kevin.  He was so very polite.. he understood my problem as this is my business line and he kept me informed even while he was working on my problem by calling a cell phone so I wouldn't be stressed.  A BIG company with even bigger-hearted employees.  Thank-you, AT&T...I am , your loyal fan,  Norvella Majors",2
BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!If there is something you dont like they will change it. Is honestly an amazing customer service. If you need to change billing or packet deals. Just ask and they will give it to you !,2
i got my slow internet problem resolved my calling their customer service number which is 509-207-4166  they worked on my computer and configured the stuff required to enhance the performance of my internet connection now my internet is working very fast i am satisfied with it,2
"Nothing but amazing service and good coverage. I was with sprint before and it was horrible they had random charges for no reason and couldn't fix anything and I lost service driving through different parts of my state. I switched over to at&t a few months ago and it's been GREAT. I am paying a little higher price but it's totally worth it, they told me what i was going to be paying every month when i was getting service and to my suprise that is the same amount every bill has been. They are helpful and focused everytime I walk into the store and I have never ever lost service when traveling. I personally am ok paying a little higher prices for quality service. So happy with the family plan we have. They offered up a military discount I knew nothing about when they saw my husband in there with me in his attire. I would reccomend at&t to anyone. Your going to pay for what you get, att delivers on that.",2
"So I was at the store on King Road 82nd Ave., Portland, OR there was a gentleman named Matt he is the manager at the store such excellent customer service he has provided for and myFamily you cannot find anywhere else I recommend each and everyone of you that are trying to get AT&T service to go see Matt King Road 82nd",2
"I've been an att customer on and off for over a decade, and recently started a new plan. The techs that answer my phone calls are always helpful and knowledgeable, and extremely courteous. They're also American, and no hard feelings towards Indian tech support because they're always helpful in a pinch, but I feel good knowing that it's American techs helping me with problems with an American company. 5+ stars from me, keep up the good work.",2
I had AT&T U-verse and DirecTV for several years. When I made my move to the new house AT&T has been nothing but frustrating and in responsive 2 anything they screwed up. First off my original install date that they emailed me turned out to be two weeks later which I was not notified. Then I give my old Gateway to the technician who installed my new U-verse Gateway and no note was made in the installation process and I'm still being charged for the old Gateway even though I turned it in to the technician several months ago. The new internet was removed from my account after 2 weeks. Calling customer service and speaking with the supervisor they were unresponsive and unable to turn my newly-installed internet back on so I turned in that Gateway and spoke about the old Gateway that I was given to the technician. The account has been in investigation for 5 months and now AT&T has turned me over to a collection agency who is demanding the money for the old Gateway that was turned in several months ago. I've had to call and talk to the customer service rep from AT&T every weekend 4 hours on end to try to resolve this and nothing has been done. When you move go with somebody else because AT&T is customer service reps and business as a whole is unresponsive and all they care about is collecting that cash from the consumer. I've never had an issue with DirecTV until AT&T purchase them and now nothing but problems.,2
They complicate their billing so much that you can't even keep track of whether they are actually charging you the right price. The remnants of hurricane Florence are heading my way. Probably get 20 mile per hour winds and they're already expect that AT&T will lose all connectivity for TV and internet. They suck,2
I would recommend anyone to try this company,2
I just got off the phone with costomer service due to switching to a new phone and not having internet.The BEST costomer representative ive ever spoken  helped me figure my problem out in less than 10 minutes. Couldnt ask for better customer service. 10/10 FIVE STARS!!!!  THANKS FOR YOUR HELP GLENDA!!!,2
got great cell service and reception. i like the family plans too.,2
"I think it's fine, I know why people don't like this website, the people usually can't speak English, the billing is annoying, it's hard to get any help and so on. But I don't use a lot of those services at the moment, I just navigate the website seeing where my data is going and so on. It's nice to have and even though it's not the fastest website, it really helps to have something like this. The only thing is that I wish I could get my smart watch synced to my phone number, I tried for so long but I could just never get it to work.",2
"This review isn't about telephone customers service. It's about a fantastic experience I had with a store employee in Marina del Rey, California. A young lady named Jennifer took the time to re-sync my phone to my blue tooth. Most other employees would be concerned about their bonuses. She kept a long time loyal customer happier. She was very knowledgeable and polite. This service gets 5 stars.",2
"I have found the service provided by this company is excellent, with staff available to answer questions concerning my account balance and statements that are reliable and accurate and prompt.  The integrity of this business is beyond reproach and there has never been anything which would be called a scam or unfair trade practice or dishonest representation in my history of doing business with them.",2
"I don't know what everyone else it talking about, it seems like this website is working just fine for me and here's why. Everything loads at a decent pace, nothing ever seems to be a problem, you can always chat with customer service, they offer plenty of options and forum pages to ask questions and to top it all off they actually want to help you",2
"I needed a plan with only data for my trip to New York, and AT&T provided me the best and cheapest option. It lasted for my 11 days there, without  a problem. Every AT&T I went to had really nice employees, and they solved my problem in a matter of minutes. Loved it!",2
They came out to fit my new broadband line.They were right on time and the guy could not have been more polite and hard working.Very impressed!,2
we have all of our services through att n we never have a connection issue ever. we game on ours as well..,2
My experience with at&t go phone has been great and today it has been even greater.i was short $1.00 on my $45 monthly plan and called customer service and I didn't even have to ask the guy credited me $1.00 very nicely of him to do that. And now I can enjoy my at&t go phone again. Thank you so much at&t you are the best in the business. I will never switch to another company ever again. And now my package comes with 6GB of high speed data even better!!,2
I have had ATT for my wireless phone service for many of years and never a problem they can't fix. The Customer Service is the best ever. I just upgraded a phone and got a free tablet that works fantastic. I highly recommend ATT to anyone looking for the best deals for smart phones.,2
i love them. always help me when i need it. the bill amount is good for what i have. the service is great all around. been with them for years and will be for years to come.,2
"This week I had an appointment for trouble with a land line to an electric gate phone entry system.  This problem has been on going.  The service person said it was not on AT&T's part of the line and must be with the entry system.  I was not happy to hear this...I had already had the system serviced by the gate company, they said it was at AT&T's end.  The service person offered to meet with my gate company!  YEA!  They have already set the appointment up.  I am hoping that the two service people can work out to find out what our issue is with the system.Andre was my service person.  He was professional, he had great communication skills and even saw another unrelated issue with the service.  Which he fixed on the spot.  He is a terrific representative for AT&T.",2
"I have used AT&T for years for UVerse and just recently went back to them for my wireless phone.  I called this week to add DirecTV, and the customer service was top-notch!  Not sure why others have had issues, but my experiences have been all good.  You do pay more for AT&T, but the fact that I do not have to worry about wrong bills, poor customer service, or anything similar, that makes it worth it to me.",2
"With all the cell phone companies and plans out there, I just wanted to put in a good word for AT&T's Go Phone. I don't need a lot of minutes or data, just for calling home or saying I'll be late. I've used the Go Phone for many years and no complaints. It only costs $25 every other month. Other people complain that they don't have coverage in certain areas but my phone can always make the call.",2
I just discovered this website from another company I hired so I am posting a review on AT&T since they knocked my cell phone bill down by 30% after I had an issue with my service.  5 stars review!!!  Chris was the Valencia store rep that helped me.  He was great.  I almost went to the Bakersfield store.,2
"I'm a little shocked about the other reviews. I signed up for AT&T's UVerse and Internet package six months ago because I desperately needed the internet in my new place (I work from home). I thought it would take days for them to come, because that's what I had been told, but within hours, an AT&T rep was knocking on my door. He set up my connection in an hour and was gone. Two months ago, my phone plan with Sprint was up, and I decided to go with AT&T this time around. I am not disappointed. When my first bill game, I was curious as to why I had pro-rated charges. I called the customer service center, and the guy who answered patiently went through all the charges with me. Not only did I get a clear understanding of my bill, but he dropped the pro-rated charges because I had not been informed of them. Best of all? Unlike with Sprint, I get service everywhere! I can finally have a conversation with my mom/sister/boyfriend while in my livingroom, in bed or even out in the country!",2
"AT&T is an amazing company that has helped me reach my business goals, that would not be possible otherwise. Don't listen to these other people who are just crazy about T-Mobile, Verizon (etc). Go with a network to you can trust. ""AT&T Rethink Possible""",2
T-Mobile IS the very best mobile service we've EVER had. Always able to reach a live body when you call and no wasted time getting jacked around from one phone prompt to another. Their service works flawlessly when we bounce back and forth to Mexico and Canada. They're doing customer service right!,2
"""I recently switched my phone service from Pure Talk to T-Mobile and had the pleasure of being assisted by Scott Wallace at the Waterville, Maine location. I was incredibly impressed with his professionalism and helpfulness. Scott was extremely knowledgeable about the different plans and patiently answered all of my questions. He made the entire process of switching carriers very easy and stress-free. I highly recommend Scott and the T-Mobile store in Waterville.""",2
"I'm a long time customer (12+ years) so I guess I'm satisfied with their service.  I'm in a plan that they no longer offer, but am able to keep as long as I stay with them, so no price increases, except ""fees"", which is five unlimited lines for under $150/month.  The service itself is generally good as no one on the plan lives in a remote area.  Customer service on their ""800"" number has also been decent overall.  They have moved to offshore agents, but my experience has been decent to very good with them.  Going into their stores is a mixed bag, but never any horrible experiences, though some better than others.Another major carrier has recently offered me new phones + gift card$ to switch, but I'm reluctant to take the bait, at least for now sticking with the ""devil I know"" as opposed to the one I don't know.",2
Kelly Handyman Services LLC led by Brandon & Fabian are true professionals.Their work is top shelf and far above the norm. Do not hesitate do call them as they will deliver superior customer service.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ⭐️,2
I am a 77 yr old woman and I was having problems answering incoming calls. I went to T-mobile store in London Ohio. I received very professional assistance. They were kind and patient with me. I appreciated their service and would recommend this store highly. 614-581-4075. B. Elfrink,2
"Today I visited the T-Mobile store across from Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida.I was greeted with a smile and incredible service that was offered by Brenda. Brenda is new at this location however she has been with T-Mobile for years.Congratulations!",2
"I was having a problem with my phone constantly going to ""do not disturb"" on its own. It wouldn't let me do anything! I finally took it to Edward at the South Haven, Michigan store and he quickly solved the problem! It hasn't given a problem since! (I had an app that took over the phone. He removed it...)",2
"From the very 1st encounter setting up my account I've had nothing but the best customer service. I question everything yet whether I'm on the phone or f2f, they always answer my questions patiently and politely. The customer service reps can ""see"" everything in my account and can address all aspects. I moved from another big mobile company that made my every move to leave as painful as possible. T-mobile helped me and even adjusted my account because I missed a deadline to take advantage of the discounts for moving to T-mobile. I've even used the chat feature (which is traditionally like a torture chamber) and found the people on the chat side actually competent and able to handle my service needs. I've been a customer for quite a while and can say T-mobile has come a LONG WAY in service quality.",2
Shout out to Reggie on the phone for helping me reset my phone after it stopped connecting to my cellular. Works perfect now and he was so helpful thank you REGGIE!!!!!,2
I recently visited T-Mobile in Ridgeland on County Line Road. Customer service was amazing Sanyonette was awesome. She helped me every step of the way getting my new iPhone 15 set up she even applied the screen protector. My billing was completely explained and I encourage everyone to visit this location. And please ask for Sanyonette.,2
I was in town and needed to visit the T-Mobile in Jefferson City Missouri.  I had the pleasure of being serviced by Eriana and Jharyld.  They were extremely professional and courteous.  What warmed my heart was the patience and kindness they treated   3 different elderly customers who each had their special challenges.  My mother is 79 and I know how I want her to be treated.  They both deserve special recognition  and a raise!,2
"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 7 watch through T-mobile about 10 days ago. I love Samsung products because their support team will help you resolve and understand any issue. However, Samsung couldn't help me because the watch kept asking for a PUK (Sim card) number that T-mobile had to give me. Not as easy as it sounds. I called tech support and got CARTER B. who is probably the best customer service representative that I've ever dealt with in my life! At 70, that's saying lots! CARTER B. could hear my frustration, just as much as I thought he was stumped. The difference? I gave up, he didn't. He researched, and researched more, and after 2 hours said he'd call me back shortly, with an answer, and again reassured me it was all going to be fine. Through the hours he spent tirelessly on the phone with me, he never sounded angry, frustrated, sick of me whining, or anything other than supportive and dedicated. He would not let me go until I felt like I was confident in myself to understand my watch. He is amazing, patient, respectful, intelligent, kind and the best customer service representative ever! I've ran many huge corporations during my working career and I would've been honored to have him represent me/my company. I hope T-mobile realizes what a gem he is, because this young man is going to make any company where he works a success! High 5 CARTER B!!! Let's give CARTER B. the standing ovation he very much deserves!",2
"It's weird that T-Mobile isn't rated much higher here. I won't ditz the other cell phone carriers I've used because it's in poor taste, but I will sing T-Mobile's praises. Definitely a superior brand! As a rule, they hire nice people, and their tower network performs exceptionally well.CAVEAT: If you want a bargain basement price, you'll need to bring your own unlocked phone and sign up for one of the ""Connect by T-Mobile"" plans. (All the plans that include a free phone cost much more.)",2
"I read some of the reviews and have never experienced anything like the complaints. T-Mobile gives people extensions, not only that they offer to split the late bill in two. It is not their fault people don't know how to budget. I have always had a great customer service experience and I have had gone T-Mobile everything even down to the bank account. I love T-Mobile because they have the best customer service people ever.",2
"Katia helped me today to choose a new phone plan and to port my current number over to the new plan.  It took a lot of her time but she still was patient, very courteous and helpful. She methodically went through all my questions explaining everything carefully.  I highly recommend the woodland shop should you need to get a new service. Not only were the other workers helpful as well but Eric even suggested a better deal than  I initially had in mind when I entered the store  Don’t hesitate to use their service. You won’t be disappointed.",2
"On Sat. Nov. 30, I went to the T-mobile store on Twenty Mile Road, in Parker, because my phone (bought from a local retailer) wasn't holding a charge.I had gone to Batteries Plus earlier in the day, who said the battery was no good.They said a new battery would be around $80.00. The phone was old, & was purchased new for $90.00 2 years ago.  It wasn't worth replacing the battery.When I went to T-mobile, I was met by 2 gentleman, who couldn't have been more understanding, gracious and eager to help!They both worked together on my phone to get it to charge. It would charge to 15, then drop to 2 once the charging cable was removed. The same issues I was having at home.Kway went out of his way to find me a phone I could comfortably afford; then he worked diligently to transfer my old phone information to the new phone,  which wasn't easy, since a phone needs to reach 20% to transfer.With his efforts, and his amazing knowledge of cell phones, he was able to transfer all of my contacts, as well as very important apps I'd saved in the old phone!I've been with T-mobile since they were Voicestream (30+ years?) and again,  realized last night that I've made the correct decision to stay with them, even though MANY companies have tried to lure me away with 'cheaper' plans!Thank you Kway AND T-Mobile....",2
"Daniel at the Ferndale Washington location helped me out with some functionalities with the auto pay as we'd experienced some fraud issues with our last credit card...just overall helpful without attitude, I don't live on my phone it's still only a tool for business. Daniel and his colleague Andrew were awesome, friendly...no hassles, just great service!!!!",2
I’ve been with T-Mobile for 17 years and am blown away by these comments. I’ve zero issues but I never miss a bill. I had gotten payment arrangements maybe twice with no problems. I love using their service and have used Verizon and sprint as well. I use customer service maybe 5-8 times a year and never once did I not get something resolved. I hate that everyone’s having issues….,2
I recently spoke to a CS Rep Melisa and she was professional. She handled my concerns and questions and helped me make an informed decision. Very pleasant and glad I got her when I called support.,2
"T-mobile upset me a lot and I would normally give them a one star but on the other side, I must say that they have sometimes outstanding people that are genuinely concerned about your problem and they help you, understand the issue and so extremly professional like the one I spoke today. His name is Axel. He was the best so far. Because of him, I will give T-Mobile a 5*. That’s how good he was! I will give them a 5*.",2
"I've been a T-Mobile customer for many years, most of which have been excellent. Unfortunately, I had to choose a different service recently, but T-Mobile customer service was excellent even when I was switching carriers. I'll be back for sure when circumstances permit!",2
"Coming from a $500 bill with Verizon Wireless, down to $207 with T-Mobile is incredible! I have been treated like a valuable customer since day one. No company is perfect. No company is trying to be perfect either. I appreciate the way T-Mobile has handled my business.",2
"I went to T-Mobile to change my plan and I encountered a terrific sales person by the name of Luis Astorga, Store 7532.   Not being a tech savvy person, Luis helped with through every facet of setting up my cell phone with extreme patience and sensitivity.    Luis went above and beyond what I  expected.   Great, great customer service.",2
"Great home internet and very reliable!  Left Xfinity after several issues with reliability and price changes.  Couldn't be happier!  I cut my internet price in half and have faster speeds!  Price is locked in so no worry about paying more a year later.  We recently had an ice storm and Xfinity was down in the area, heard all the complaints over Facebook on Xfinity, mine was running strong!  Glad I made the change, no issues hear and happy to be a cusomer!",2
"I am very thankful that Barbara G (Customer care) guided us patiently what to do and helped us to reach out  to the right T mobile store for help. The T-Mobile store in Desoto(851 I35 east) is very helpful especially Bryce and another lady. They were very patient and Bryce spent more than half an hour helping us to activate my new iPhone. Therefore, I want to say a big ""thank you"" to these lovely people.",2
I would like to give a huge shoutout to my local team of customer service reps especially Josh. We are very grateful for the assistance you provided in resolving the 3 month ongoing issues that really had us in a bind. T-mobile remains #1 in customer service because of you brother. We cannot thank you enough!,2
T-Mobile Store #4139(144 Moreland Ave ) Had the most Genuine and Outstanding customer service thus far. Hollis & Keem did a great job helping me and was very knowledgeable about their work. I salute their GREAT customers service and helping one another out. I will come back to this one. Thank You Guys,2
"I was literally at my wit's end and ready to break down and cry.  An update locked my phone (I had never locked it, therefore no password set up to unlock).  After being on another phone for 5 hours trying to get help, I was told repeatedly I would have to do a factory reset and lose everything.  I did the reset, but Samsung wanted to text me a code to unlock the reset, but no text messages could get through.  I took the phone to the Princeton, Texas T-Mobile store, and Pedro had personality plus, but he also had lots of knowledge and got my phone operative.  Then he restored all my contacts, photos, and calendar.  Super kudos to Pedro.  You definitely deserve a raise!",2
"We had a great experience switching from Verizon to T-mobile at the North Ridgeville Ohio store on Center Ridge Road. Chris was our salesman and was very knowledgeable and helpful. We were given a lot of the promotions and discounts going on. The manager Brian was also very helpful and friendly     We also got the internet special and love it. It works great in our home on all of our tvs, computers, tablets etc. I would recommend them highly. They made the switch of 3 phone lines very easy.",2
"This review is for Rej (Reg?). Thank you for your amazing customer service. I had trouble with data connection and issues with my phone, on top of that, my old phone was shutting down and I was unable to use it. Rej provided outstanding customer service and was really kind, empathetic, and professional. Thank you for all your help and assistance!💫🌸",2
I traveled recently and had an amazing experience with the data and connection in other countries with my T-Mobile service. It helped so much! I used to have sprint and traveled at that time and the connection wasn't good at all so this was a huge relief. I tried to file a compliment with T-Mobile but couldn't find an option online so I'm writing the review here.,2
"Minus 2It's disappointing that you must give at least one star to write the review, when you really deserve a minus two. I'm escalating my complaint to a state representatives office because T-Mobile won't cancel a bill. I've tried the phone(twice), I visited the store to verify who I am, and still two months later I'm still receiving a bill.I hope everyone reading this will also send a notice to their congressional representative as I think T-Mobile is using us to pad profit numbers before quarterly reports are due...an illegal practice.It's absurd, but your state representative lives in your area and would love to uncover such a scandal. This is what they do and they are able to help. If you've had a billing problem with T-Mobile, please reach out to your representative's office to discuss the issue (It's what they are there for).",2
"We were greeted by a lovely sales rep yesterday to help us purchase our new telephones She was very informative and helpful in transferring the information from our old phones to the new ones which took a very long time because our previous co was not very helpful.She was very kind considerate and very knowledgeable. Also, very patient T Mobile of Southern Pines NC is very lucky to have her as an emplyee",2
"I went into a T Mobile store on 4000 West and around 4500 South in West Valley City, Utah.  I was immediately helped with some help on setting up a new phone and also helped me get a galaxy watch.  The two employees helped me for a long time to understand how the phone and galaxy watch worked.  Their names are Anderson and Jasmine.  I highly recommend this store to anyone needing a new phone or help with their equipment.",2
My wife and I stopped in to a T-Mobile at 5011 Meadowood Mall in Reno and had the best experience ever. Naomi B. was are T-Mobile expert whom assisted us; she answered all are questions and helped through several issues we were having. Thanks Naomi! -Keith and Rebeca,2
"Hi I had a few questions to ask of Tmobile and gave them a 5 star rating! The gentleman that I spoke with is Aliz, he was so professional at helping me with my question! Aliz provided me with best representative service today! Aliz was so sweet and he cared and you can't find that anywhere anymore! Even when I'm having a bad day and need assistance from Tmobile about a promotion or whatever the case may be I can always count on them to put me in a good mood with there cheerfulness and positive attitude that I always experience with Tmobile representatives. Whatever there doing keep it up, I used to ask if they all do a happy dance before there shift starts lol!         Sincerely,Brittany S",2
"Somehow my phone had gotten a virus on it as I had been told by a cell phone repair shop.  I was told to remove all pictures, passwords & any thing that I wanted to keep from losing before he did a Factory Reset on it. I did as directed other than saving my contacts which got lost !! I decided to go in to T-Mobile in Lithonia, Ga. and Tyniah who is a Manager there was the one that was able to retrieve every thing that I needed !!!!  She is very good at her job and was very friendly while working on my phone.",2
"I needed help with my home internet, and the app wasn't working, so I was told to go to a store.  I went to store number 5GSP in Stow, Ohio.  The personnel there were friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  I was able to obtain quick service.  Good job!",2
"Lawrenceburg, TNThis is the absolute best customer service from t mobile I've had in 15 years. Literally the only positive experience I've had in that time. Thank you to Trevor and Alex. You need something from t mobile in TN this is the spot to go to no cap",2
Arian @ T-Mobile was by far the most helpful and patient king of all times. He helped us to much and listened to our technical issues. Great experience. Not a lot of representatives are like him. He’s one of a kind.,2
"The customer service for TMobile internet has been absolutely fantastic. Our internet has been wonderful since we switched from our previous company (Spectrum). Also when I got stuck setting up my online account today, Robert, was a huge help in setting up my online account. Thank you Robert for the wonderful customer service that you provided!",2
"T-Mobile needs to promote their Trustpilot, it’s a shame it’s filled with such negative reviews. I’ve had nothing but great experiences with T-Mobile USA. I’ve been a customer for close to 14 years now. My family of 4 is on the Magenta Military Max plan. We have a free 4th line, so we pay next to nothing per line. We’ve all used our phone service for free while roaming internationally, it has been a life saver. We’ve also all used the free in-flight WiFi. Most recently I flew to Ireland and had free WiFi from T-Mobile for the whole flight over the Atlantic! I personally believe T-Mobile has the best phone plan currently available on the postpaid market, and has had the best plan for nearly a decade now!",2
I got help at TMobile that is located at 1818 3rd Ave.  Great Falls I have had T-Mobile coverage for my phone for several years but just got internet coverage today.  I was very satisfied with Jonny's help.  I was having difficulty changing my internet on my computer but he got me up and running!! I would give the whole store a 10!,2

"This morning, while accompanying my sister to the hospital lab, I discovered that my cell phone was missing upon my return. I promptly visited the T-Mobile store located at 235 N Citrus St, Ste B in West Covina, where I received assistance from Mason McGee. With Mason's guidance, I was able to quickly locate my phone using a map, and discovered that it had been left under a chair in the hospital waiting area. I express my gratitude to Mason for his exceptional help in retrieving my phone.",2
Clair is very patient and helpful! She’s indeed five star,2
"I'm so excited about the 5- star service received by Sir Cartier at the Crossroads location in Terrell, Texas. I wish more employees at Tmobile would follow Cartier's lead of Good Service.",2
"I have been with T-Mobile for seven years. Part of that was with sprint, and the service has always exceeded my expectations. The employees are well-versed on all the devices, including my iPhone and iPad and T-Mobile Internet. I shop at Sams Club in Grand Prairie and find that there T-Mobile set up is very convenient very friendly and helpful. I am working with GG and James Jordan (upgrading my devices)who’s always been very professional and friendly. I like going to these Satellite T-Mobile spots as they can answer all my questions in a timely matter and I don’t have to wait in line like I do at some of the T-Mobile stores and if there is a line, I can always do my shopping and when I come back, they are ready to answer my questions. The main reason I’m sticking with T-Mobile is there pricing and plans ….and I  know that the people that work at T-Mobile at Sams Club know their stuff and take care of me as well as hundreds of other customers and  BUSINESS Customers that shopped there on the daily basis.AJ SNACKS",2
I recently activated my WiFi service with T-Mobile.I visited Bufrod store and met Jeff RussoJeff is extremely friendly knowledgeable and explains in easy language.7 STAR for Jeff,2
I love mobile. I've been a customer for so long back whenever they were altell as well. I've never had an issue other than when the towers are down but the once in a blue moon and what services don't have that happen. 🙂🙂,2
"I went to the T-Mobile store in Hyannis, MA. My cell phone died 3 weeks before and I was caught in the middle between the insurance company and the repair facility (who ended up closing their doors). When my claim was approved, someone suggested we say goodbye to our current carrier and go with T-Mobile. We're so glad we did. Michael is great to deal with. He thoroughly explained our options. When we decided to go with T-Mobile he spent time with us to set up our phones. Since our initial dealings with Michael, we've been back to the store for a couple of things we had a hard time figuring out and the staff that helped us was great. We really appreciate the staff in the Hyannis location and highly recommend them. Thank you to Michael and the team!",2
"I have had the worst experience EVER joining T-Mobile about 6 months ago. It started out awful with the very first phone I got, then our bill was being raised every month without our knowledge then they charged us several fees for no reason. The reason I am giving them 5 stars is because today after 6 months of dealing with this nightmare I finally got Carrie Mary as a customer service rep who was able to fix my bill, lower it to an amazing $100 a month, she has been monitoring my bill for me so that this never happens again and I am FINALLY satisfied with my T-Mobile experience thanks to her. Without meeting her then I would have changed carriers that day. All other customer reps simply wanted to “look into it and give me a call back” which never happened.",2
"I had the BEST experience with T-Mobile!!!! My mother recently joined and I wasn’t convinced to follow until I talked with customer service representative from Maine, Galin. I was barely interested in joining and was not planning on buying a new phone or joining T-Mobile until my mother called and asked about the services and phones. Galin was so happy and enthusiastic to help us with this and walk us through pricing and plans. He was so so funny and so very helpful. I’ve never had a phone service be so informative. I had the best customer service experience and I hope I can always get help like this again. If not, get help from Galin again!! Thank you for hiring such an amazing spirit! I really hope this reaches T-Mobile, we’re doing the other survey as well because he was just that good!! Thank you Galin!!",2
"I had the best experience on my phone call today with Zoe! I had bad service with my first attempt to fix the issue I was having and was told they couldn’t and wouldn’t help me. I gave it another try today and Zoe helped me and solved my problem, after I was told they couldn’t do anything,I called again today and spoke with  Zoe who helped me so much today and did such an amazing job! Thank you Zoe you were amazing!!",2
"I have had phone and internet service with T-Mobile for 3 months now. I couldn't be any happier with them. I wen from not being able to use Comcast phone or 1 bar to 5 bars at almost all times. The internet service is just as good and I actually have faster download speeds. I can't say enough about how much I enjoy my T-mobile service, and I am saving $80.00 a month.",2
"Taylor Smith from the Tallahassee FL location, specifically Apalachee Pkwy, Suite 13, was a life saver!  He went above and beyond to assist me.  Thank You Taylor!!",2
"I recently purchased a phone and plan at T-mobile in Alabaster Alabama. Benny Alvarado was awesome. He was so helpful and very nice. I was originally told they didn’t have the phone I wanted so I reluctantly chose another phone I didn’t like as well since I didn’t have time to wait on a phone to be shipped. Benny went in the back and found one last phone of my choice hidden in the back. He had so much patience when I couldn’t remember my different passwords and had to restart set up twice. He was kind and very courteous during the whole process. I love my service, plan and internet. I would highly recommend this company and this employee",2
I have been extremely happy with service and pricing.  Everything I was promised was delivered. Easy to reach customer service and every time my issue was resolved to my satisfaction,2
12/28 at around 8:15pm. Just want to let you know that the customer service II received was just Fantastic. I just wanted to let you know ☺️ the individual was experienced and was very helpful in straightening out my bill that I was VERY VERY NOT HAPPY with when I went online to see my Bill. Keep up the Good work with your experience workers. Thank you 👍 keep up the 😊 Good work!!,2
Went to T-Mobile and Jose Z help me with my phone problem. I couldn’t update some apps. He spent less than a hour to update my phone change my screen cove. He is very professional and easy to talk to. I would recommend anyone that uses T-Mobile to go visit Jose Z at the quarry. He’s awesome!,2
"My family and I went to TMobile on Centerville Rd because of a phone issue. Scott and Harry were the best! Both were so helpful and knowledgeable about the products, the promotions the bill, etc. they really took their time to explain things to us and help us find the best plan for our family. I would HIGHLY recommend this store to everyone. Great customer service!!",2
"I often find it challenging to connect with the new generation, as our perspectives differ significantly. Nevertheless, I had a positive experience with Niko and Kimberly, employees at the T-Mobile store located at 2605 Woodland Blvd, Deland, while upgrading my iPhone from a 12 to a 16. Lacking familiarity with the latest smartphones, I was grateful for Kimberly's exceptional patience and understanding. Throughout the phone transfer process, both Niko and Kimberly kept me engaged and informed about T-Mobile's current options and promotions. They took the time to review my account and provided a brief tutorial on the new features of the iPhone 16, even after store hours, without making me feel rushed. Their professionalism and support made a significant difference, and I truly appreciate their contributions to T-Mobile.",2
"Just finished at the store in Elk Grove Village. The CS rep Jordan, was awesome.  He handled several customers as the only employee. The time it took to help everyone was amazing. Thank you, Jordan.",2
"Brandon from the staples Store T-Mobile was very knowledgeable, and very helpful. He programmed my phone, because I had no idea what I was doing. Very good customer service and I will refer my friends to this store. Thanks Brandon.",2
"I've been with the same cell phone company for over 30 years until last week.  I went into Store 5121 NC Hwy 42, Garner NC.  The manager of the store was so impressive with her knowledge base.  Her name is Jamillah B.  I thought I'd never leave my cell phone company, but after hearing what T-Mobile had to offer and the fact that I saved almost $70 a month with new plan, I was force (by common sense) to say bye-bye to the former company!  Of course, they were sorry to see me leave after being a loyal customer for so long, but it was time.  I'm elated, glad and overjoyed with my choices.  I have NO complaints and love the money I'm saving!  Thanks again Ms. Jamillah.",2
"We recently had the pleasure of working with Uriel and Abas from T-Mobile, and we cannot speak highly enough of the outstanding service they provided. They helped us transfer our phones and internet to T-Mobile, guiding us through all the necessary steps with professionalism, respect, and thoroughness.What really stood out to us was how knowledgeable and efficient they were. They took the time to explain everything in detail and answered all of our questions, making the process of switching over seamless and stress-free. Not only that, but they also helped us save a significant amount of money each month, which we are extremely grateful for.Overall, my husband and I highly recommend Uriel and Abas and the T-Mobile team to anyone looking to switch over to T-Mobile. Their exceptional service truly made a difference, and we are thrilled with our decision to work with them. Thank you, Uriel and Abas, for your outstanding work!",2
"I have been a Sprint/T-mobile customer for 18 years. I had been having issues with my phone, dropping calls, never had this problem before. Called spoke with T-mobile Customer Technical Support (Jasmine). She is amazing, she tried a few things and stated she would call me back later than evening to see if it worked. As promised she called me back, I explained to her that I was still having issues. She asked if I would take the phone to T-mobile so that they could change the sim card, she also explained additional options. Again, Jasmine stated that she would call me back in a day to see if it was resolved. As promised she called and I explained to her that I was still having issues. Jasmine then stated there's one more thing I want to try, and it actually worked. She was so professional, courteous, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and would not give up until my issue was resolved. Thank You Jasmine.",2
"I went to the new TMobile store on 418 HWY 70 West in Havelock yesterday around 11, rightafter they opened.  The 3 employees had the best attitude,  smiles on their faces and were very kind and helpful.  You don’t find that a lot any more. Rarely.  I told them it was the best T Mobile experience I have ever had.",2
"There ad is correct! Ordered Home Internet, received at front door in 2 days and had set up under 15 minutes. Was able to connect my two TV’s, echo dot,  tablet and phone. So far so good!",2
Always had really good service with them. Switched to AT&T and that was a joke. So went back to T-Mobile. I’m surprised to read all these bad reviews. The only I want to request from T-Mobile is that they have the same promo as Verizon. Ya know trade in any phone any condition and get the iPhone 15 on them. I rrrreally don’t wanna go with Verizon. But right now it seems that’s the only way I can get a new phone.,2
"I worked with Meli at T-Mobile customer care support and must say it was the most positive experience I've had through their call center. I generally go into the stores for resolution but in this case, Meli was incredibly patient, empathetic and definitely in troubleshooting mode and determined to get to the bottom of my inquiry. We have NOT always had the greatest customer care experience w/ T-Mobile (over the phone) but if Meli is any indicator, things have certainly improved exponentially! Kudos to her!!!!!!",2
Nicole was very helpful and polite with all of my questions and comments. Was very easy to have a conversation and to get all the information needed in a timely fashion. Great customer service and worker,2
"Had a new phone set up.  Way over my head.  Arty made it a simple and enjoyable process.  Very focused with a side of humor.  Thanks Arty in Edgewater, Colorado.",2
I switched to T-Mobile from AT&T in July 2024 for my iPhone only. I chose Go5G Next. The same plan is designed for Yearly upgrades. This left my Android phone on my family's AT&T.This means I have to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max in September 2024 to start my iPhone Yearly Upgrade. It would be an iPhone upgrade from my iPhone 14 Pro Max.,2
"I recently transferred 4 lines from Verizon to T-Mobile. I have to say, my experience with T-Mobile so far has been fantastic! I've had several reasons to contact T-Mobile customer service during the process (billing, phone reimbursement, etc). Outside of an hour plus waiting for their tranfer department, contacting customer service has been very responsive and pleasant. The whole process has been seamless. Several years ago I went through the same process transferring from Visible to Verizon. Verizon was an absolute nightmare! I literally spent 30+ hours chatting and on hold trying to resolve the myriad of issues they couldn't seem to get corrected. Kudos to T-Mobile for their excellent customer service in an age when everyone else is sacrificing quality service for a buck.",2
"I’m very happy with the phone and a deal I received for my new iPhone 13. The gentleman John was very thorough. Very knowledgeable of his work . Great customer service at the T-Mobile store in Manor ,Texas.",2
"I sent this via email to the CEO (update:  Mike replied and indicated that he appreciated my email.  He will reward those who helped me.  He was very concerned about the overall low rating of t mobile on Trustpilot.  He will look into this).Mike,This is written to show my deep appreciation for the three amazing employees who made my day, my week, and perhaps my year.  I am not exaggerating.  I was a customer of your competition and I went into your store because I wanted to get a good deal on mobile phone service.  Your team took the time to get me a great deal, patiently educated me on how to move from my current provider over to T Mobile.  The process was not quick and in fact it took over two hours to complete the process of moving two phones to the T Mobile system and eventually moving all of my data from my old phones to the new iPhone 15 models.The district manager was present and offered me a great deal on internet and a land line. He even told me that the price for service would never change.  Incredible.Please extend a thank you to this great team of employees.  They are Anthony, Lorenni, and Yassine.  They work at the store in Exton, PA at the Main Street shopping center.I find that the best way to keep great employees is to show your appreciation.  As the leader, you set the example.  Do the right thing.Thank you for taking the time to read this.Sincerely,Jeff DavidsonSatisfied customer since today... Keep it that way!Jeffrey A.

"Yesterday I went to the T-Mobile store at the Eastview Mall in Victor New York. I needed a new phone as my old one had charging issues. Sheshe was the woman who helped me out with my new phone. She didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need and she saved me a lot of money by having me trade my old phone in.  I was in the store for quite a while, but I didn't mind. Sheshe helped me out while working with others that came in. Her and her co-worker Tanya were polite and knowledgeable. Sheshe  was even polite to the irate man who kept coming back in because he didn't know what he was doing but was blaming everything on the woman that had finished her shift and left (personally I would have decked the guy). I have nothing but good things to say, my new phone is great and getting it was nothing less than enjoyable.",2
Great service right to the point Jose was very helpfull!!!,2
"All carriers have flaws, but T-Mobile has THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you’re at work, they’ll help you through text!!  Everyone has problems with internet, but not all carriers put as much effort into helping customers as T-Mobile. These poor ratings must be old ones, as it’s not fair when I’ve had the best experience ever with customer service!",2
Chose T-Mobile because of the 5G coverage in my area. (Verizon and ATT maps show coverage but in reality don't exist. Verified with MVNO sims.) After using spotty MVNO online services it was a pleasure to walk into a T-Mobile store and sign up. I have had service for a year with no problems at all. I am on autopay and that works without a problem.,2
"I can’t rave enough about customer service at the T-Mobile store in the Milford Ct Post Mall! Sherman was amazing! I had several issues with 2 separate products and he worked patiently with me on both! Outstanding personality, he was an absolute pleasure to work with! Also the entire crew Kristopher and Steven were extremely helpful as well! Thank you gentlemen for making my hate of going to the Mall a pleasure!",2
"Had a great experience when purchasing a new phone.  Genesis,  the sales professional who educated me and gave me many options to choose from was awesome! Refreshing to meet a 20somthing who is driven and overwhelmed me with information! T-mobile will loose her soon because she is unique.  Go see her if you need a phone ASAP.",2
"A person on my account was in a pickle tonight and needed the recent call info on his line.  So easy-peasy to get to this kind of information - in fact, ANY information you need about your phone service.  Also, if I had needed to call for assistance the local team for our region is terrific and will stay with you through any issues pertaining to your phone and phone service.  I've been a customer for 20 years and wouldn't switch for anything.  This may sound solicited - it's not!  Of all my ""utility"" and ""communications"" services I rate T-Mobile  ""best of class.""",2
"On Saturday, 20 August at 1:30 p.m., my wife and I went to T-Mobile store located on Laclede Station Road in Webster Groves, MO.  We had purchased Smart Phones from T-Mobile in 2019, and had a few questions about operating and updating.  A gentleman there named ""Ron"" spent at least a half hour answering our questions and suggested ways for us to get better use out of our phones.  He was most gracious and nice, and extremely smart, and we left T-Mobile well-informed, more comfortable with our phones, and ready to upgrade with T-Mobile next year.  He was not pushy at all, and we definitely will be dedicated T-Mobile customers from now on out.  Thank You, Ron!  The McCormicks of Saint Louis, MO.",2
Great customer service from Kelly at the Brooklyn Center location she’s beyond expectations,2
"Sharnael was amazing!!! 6/7/2022 at 4p.m. she was not only polite and went above and beyond, but was very professional and patient. She addressed all my concerns. She needs a bonus/raise because she was just amazing. It took an hour in total but because of her going beyond. Thank you!",2
I went in the other day to purchase a new phone from T-Mobile at Rialto location. Let me say the experience went so well. Stephany was the one who helped me the whole way through. I was going back and forth undecided of which phone to choose. I appreciated that she had great patience with me. And I can say I am very happy of my choice. Thank You Stephany- Thank You T-Mobile.

Thomas had to be the best we ever had at the Butler Store. We need him to stay. He was the best!!!,2
"T-Mobile expert Darius, Ashburn, VA was very helpful, efficient, knowledgeable and professional in helping me out with phone connectivity issues. This was after being turned away from the T-Mobile Leesburg, VA store and told that I had to contact T-Mobile via their help line. Stay away from T-Mobile Leesburg store. Driving 12 minutes further is worth the service.",2

"I purchased a new Cat 22 flip phone a few days ago. I had an issue with the talk to type feature and the screen would not switch between portrait and landscape. My large hands and the small screen made texting impossible without these features. Colby , one of the reps at the T Mobile store on Maugens Ave. in Hagerstown fixed both issues in minutes after the rep in Waynesboro, Pa. T Mobile  and the on line chat people for T mobile didn't have a clue what to do. The young man deserves a raise in pay.",2
"I personally don't know or understand what All this talk about TMoble Not providing Excellent support.

"I just upgraded my to the iPhone 13 and had several issues getting the phone to work properly. I went to two store and chatted with online tech support for over two hours. I went to two stores and no one was either willing or able to help me.  The very last store I went into was in Rosemount, MN and David fixed my phone in under 5 minutes.  It really boils down to people and training.  Thank you David!",2
"Compared to Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile has been a breath of fresh air. Their support people seem to be located in the United States, they actually know how to fix and deal with issues, and they're friendly.  T-Mobile's 5GUC service is blazing fast and free of issues and problems.  The billing and online portal from T-Mobile absolutely blows away Verizon's portal; T-Mobile's portal is simple, intuitive and concise, where Verizon's is a bloated mess that is always broken.",2
"customer service  is horrible, changed from sprint to T mobile  when sprint merged with T-Mobile incorrect billing and charges, I am the account holder , they are charging my brother eventho i pay the billing , extremely frustrate, called called customer service over an hour wait, still on hold, considering hanging to another carrier, really frustrated with the amount of time wasted",2
"At first, it was rocky, but now it is an excellent gateway.  My speed is around 500 Mbps at 6:00 PM, high traffic time of day.T-Mobile bandwidth allows me to work from home and participate in video conferencing meetings.  I added a TPLink mesh router to support the T-Mobile gate through my home.",2
I have nothing but good things to say about Tmobile. I even switched my parents  over and they are saving over $60 a month! They also both got a free phone and costumer service was excellent  helping them set up their new phones . That says a lot since my parents are 80 years old.Almost all my family is using Tmobile  and we are all happy with our serviceThank you Tmoble!Keep up the great customer service!!!,2
After 11 different people I spoke to through Sprint and T-Mobile I finally got someone that I could understand and also that he knew what he was talking about. His name was Tony and he saved the day. He was very polite he explained everything thoroughly and I really appreciate him and the time he took for my daughters phone.,2
"I can't speak for other locations but for me, the T-Mobile store located at 4825 Stone Mountain Hwy, Lilburn, GA has gone beyond my expectation with setting things right, communicating what's happening during each step of the process, and providing the necessary follow-up when there is a delay. Perhaps this store and its employees are the templates that should be duplicated.",2
I needed a phone. I got good service and got what I wanted . I don't like passwords on my phone so Juan took the password off for me and gave me my senior discount and a cheaper plan. Juan was nice and explained different options I could get.,2
"I am a fan of T-Mobile, they are by far one of the best mobile services I've had. However, I wish they would put up a tower in my area (Rainelle, WV) they have a site location here, and I get great network service at the store because they have a booster. I don't get good enough network coverage where I live, only about a mile from their store. My sync up drive will not update until you drive at least 30 minutes out of town. The home internet is unavailable to me because they are waiting for a tower to be put up. But other than that, I love the deals/promotions and features T-Mobile offers!",2
UPDATE!!!!!T MOBILE MADE IT RIGHT AGAIN!!!!I have been with TMobile for almost 18 years and things were great until now. A representative offered me an additional line on my plan for $0 per month so I purchased an additional phone and added it on only to find that they are now charging me $30 per month for that line. Many calls and escalated up to managers and they are telling me their rep was new and wrong to offer that deal and they refuse to fix it. The old bait and switch. Looks like it’s time to switch.,2
"I recently visited the T-Mobile store located on Flagler and 100th Ave.  Miami.   I must say that I’m extremely satisfied with the attention and help received particularly from the Manager, but also the rest of the staff.  I hesitated before going given the reviews some people write, but in my case, and from comments made by regular customers there, I’m extremely happy I did business with them.",2

"I recently went into a new store at Battle Ridge Pavilion, Powder Springs Rd, Marietta, GA 30064.  I am not a customer but just needed help getting a new case on my iphone.  There were 3 employees there and each one greeted me with a smile and assistance!  I was impressed. Good job, guys!!",2
I dropped my phone and the screen shattered also leaving my screen unresponsive to the touch. I took a visit to T-mobile as usual in hopes of finding Jailene there. Jailene has always had exceptional service skills while working fast and efficiently. I was out of t mobile with my upgraded iPhone 13 and some accessories within the hour. Hands down always the best place to come and if you’re looking for someone to guide you in your cell phone services- ask Jailene.,2
"Jenny ID 055272 is the type of customer service I'm use to from tmobile.  She didn't haggle me or act as if it was a chore to assist a loyal long term faithful customer.  She explained things very clearly and made sure I wasn't ever inconvenienced. She allowed me to explain uninterrupted and also apologized for experiences with tmobile that had nothing to do with the care she was providing me. If every customer care representative was like her, T-mobile would be the only carrier needed in America. Please reward her with responsibility of management because she is ready to not only be the example but to set the example for others to follow. Promote now!",2
I had the best help from a representative named Nate is a representative named Nathan.. He helped me and his personality was so wonderful I wanted to leave a review he was very bubbly outgoing and very patient you have one wonderful asset on your team on your team T-Mobile. If I could call every time and have a bubbly personality like this I would never have a problem calling he took care of all my needs and was so friendly to go extra on helping me with my new device information he deserves a raise,2
I called tmobile today to repair a phone I bought from Bestbuy. I spoke with a Rep named Leslie today 1/23/22. She was very helpful & courteous she even stayed on the phone while I spoke to a repair technician . She went above & beyond to make sure that I was going to get a repair ticket before exiting off of the call. I'm very grateful for her superb customer service (some might say it's her job)because I know she didn't have to do it! Thank you Leslie & to all the Leslie's that really love assisting customers & resolving issues!,2
"At The Falls mall T-Mobil store Miami,FloridaAgent Estrella Conminas spent 1 hour on the phone with billing department helping me on a issue that was going on for a month. She had the professionalism, courtesy, knowledge and customer service attitude and took care the problem from roots. She was actually loosing money with me because at the end found out she works on commission only and lost other clients coming to purchace. She is the best of the best. would make a great manager + higher. Thank you T-MobilEstevez",2
"I had a good experience at Surfside T-Mobil branch today. Dominicea was so kind as I enter the store and Mykel was very helpful taking the time to respond my questions. Thank you for the courtesy to both of you. Keep up the kindness, good manners and work ethics.",2
"Hubs & I have been with T-Mobile for about 17-18years now. Our son has joined us on our phone plan & we now have the internet in our home provided by T-Mobile. We’ve had our battles in the past but I really cannot complain about their services. I had received a few emails from them this past couple weeks, asking to take a short survey & get a gift. I thought it was total bologna but did it anyway. Less than 2 weeks later, there was the prize that I had chosen in my mailbox!!!! Thank you T-Mobile!!! You are appreciated.",2
"On 5/25 I visited store at Eastgate Mall, Cin., Oh. Joe Alvarado and John Lombert assisted in changing phones for me for over 2 hrs. They were pleasant and very helpful.  I will always be a T Mobile customer!",2
Biggest frauds on the face of the planet!! Charging my mom for someone else’s account!! She’s almost 80!! What a scam and you don’t answer your phone. Cowards!! You know you’re crooks! Your service is crap!! You suck at customer service. Go Away!! You Suck!!,2
"Customer service over the phone 611, with T-Mobile, and  “Megan”, including the technical support, has gone above and beyond to do their job.They are very…. kind people who want to help in any capacity they know how.It’s greatly appreciated.And sadly they do not follow up with a survey. The time I want to report how impressed I am with the service I was given.So here I find myself searching for any kind of way to let others know my gratitude I feel tonight. Not often do I feel overwhelmed like this from the sincerity of another.Thank You T-Mobil for employee these wonderful people. I hope you take great care of them!!",2
On 11/20/21 I visited the T Mobile store number 6853 and received excellent customer service from Sales Rep # ****041. This representative was very professional and very friendly. Kudos to T Mobile for hiring such a high quality representative.,2
"I see a lot of negative reviews for T-Mobile but my personal experience has been wonderful. I just ordered a iPhone 13 Pro Max & the customer service was amazing!! A wonderful gentleman named Aziz is a saint!! I pick up my phone this week & he has offered to help me set it up, transfer data from my old phone, & help me add a new line for my Daughter. As an additional  bonus he has agreed to help me apply the screen protector (I have trouble getting it on right). If that isn’t outstanding customer service then I don’t know what is. I can’t speak for other stores BUT our T-Mobile goes above & beyond!! Thank you Aziz!!!  Love these guys!!",2
"T Mobile has been nothing but great...ok several areas up 75N towards Lee that's sketchy but that's it. Good customer service and can't beat the plans...a lot of entitled complaining here on this page...wah, wah, wah...",2
Tmobile has excellent service but they probably seem bad to all of you guys because they are probably vaccinated. Don’t get the vaccinated guys. Or you guys are probably vaccinated and have gone absolutely bonkers/silly.,2
"For me, customer service is everything. Most of the goods and services we use ate commodity, and work and even cost pretty much the same. So the real mark of qualities in a company is how they deal with issues as they arise. All things being equal, I haven’t really experienced customer service as responsive as T-Mobile’s. That doesn’t mean I always get what I want, but at least I know that someone with authority to do things has heard me.We have been customers for over nine years, and use them for both business and personal communications. There might be other companies or slightly better in some areas, but the combination of service and customer service means that I am happy",2
T-Mobile is fantastic! Thanks for saving me $150 monthly by taking me away from both Verizon and Hargray! Very happy with customer service as well. All the way around they are the better choice!,2
Crystie she was a good person to help me out with my bill I love her for what she did for my family  thank you god bless her and her family and her co workers family to t mobile the best phone company,2
"I love Mae and Cale.  They run the store and all is good.  I found it odd that two managers walked around the store looking at items and signs when the entire store was packed.  They had three people working and they were slammed with a LONG line.  I mean could they not jumped in an helped? Kim and the other male manager were more concerned about a sales rep drink being the counter and a crease in a sign.  I was rather taken back by the way Kim spoke to her employees.  She told me that she was the manager and I thought to myself I wouldn't want to work with or for you.  I mean who redirects an employee with an entire store of customers.  Again, love the customer service reps that work at this store.    They are kind and so helpful even though they have limited help.  And take unthoughtfulness from a manager.",2
"I would like a commend Matt C.  He was very helpful and cool.  One of the nicest people I’ve met at a phone store, this guy needs a promotion.Store 2SJO 1391 34th st N st Pete FL",2
Lamar was so PATIENT WONDERFUL AND SOME OF THIS BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FIXED ALL MY PROBLEMS HE IS BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT SO VERY POLITE HALES CORNERS WISC,2
"I don't understand when I saw a 2 rating.  My experience with T-Mobile in Pace, FL was outstanding!  First time to get internet.  Was paying $80 to AT&T and now I pay $50.  The person who help me at that time explained everything.  When I got home, I didn't understand something and I called and the problem was solved.  Was paying Straightalk  $90 and I am still paying $90....BUT...so many more bennies,  I now get Netflix monthly for always, Paramount free for a year and Apple for a year.  Might  only be for a year but I will still be saving $16 on Netflix alone a monthly after that.  My rep was Taylor.  Talk about patience,  She took care of everything from setting up my phone, to setting up a new phone for my husband. Now anyone who has changed carriers knows the time and frustration of doing it.  She took care of all of it and I wish I could contactT-Mobile to leave a review there.  She is an outstanding rep for T-Mobile.  That stores environment is relaxful, friendly and everybody seems so patient.  I give Taylor a 2 thumbs up for a job well done,",2
Dylan who is a phone tech for T-Mobile was very helpful.You guys have a great employee and he had honestly deserves a raise and to be promoted.,2
"I had an outstanding customer experience at the T-Mobile Store, 4225 Ramsey Street, Fayetteville, North Carolina! The Representative, Isaac, went ""above and beyond"" helping me get my new iPhone 13 Pro Max activated! I had problems getting the SIM card out of my old phone (iPhone 6S), and he literally provided me with the utmost professionalism, compassion and expertise! It took almost an hour to transfer my information to my new phone. He was not only patient through that process - but he went ABOVE and BEYOND by installing my new phone in the protective case and putting on the protective shield for me; both items I brought with me to the store, but had planned to do myself! I also watched Isaac treat other customers that entered into the store with that same level of warmth and professionalism! Thank you Isaac - and thank you T-Mobile!",2
I've had T-Mobile for over a year I've never had a service any better in my life just to let y'all know so many other providers are not,2
The customer service at Orland Park store 15615 Lagrange Rd was 10 stars. The best I’ve experienced.Thank youThank you Thank you,2
"I learned the hard way it's not always the provider that's the problem for slower data, etc. Sometimes it's the VPN.",2
"TMobile home internet is great, however signed up on 12/25/2021, received two units on 12/28/21. Tried for over a month to get a hold of someone on the phone to correct the issue of two units only to find out we had to drive an hour to the tmobile store. Customer service in the Elizabeth City NC store(Tanglewood Dr) was excellent. Representative Nik got us a new pin# for the unit we have hooked up and cancelled the account on the second one. We were to receive a return label  by email. That did not happen. Called customer service and they said sorry we can't help you. That account has been cancelled. Called Nik at the store we had previously visited, told him what was going on. He said let me call you back. Within 15 minutes, Nik called me back and told me to check my email. Sure enough, there was the label. Nik gave us the best customer service that I have had with a company in a very long time. The 5 star rating is for the service provided by Nik at the store.",2
Justice  (842) from Pottsville store was wonderful.... Justice explain everything and  perfect gentlemenThank you,2
"Been with T-Mobile for 16 years; thank you Shay for your customer service today, you're one of the reasons we haven't needed to explore other options.I should mention the online chat feature for customer service is not helpful. That's okay I just call in and someone's always available to help (Except at night).",2
James at the Aliquippa store is a Duuuude,2
"Supervisor, Nakiya Robinson did a great job today!  The professional and diligent attention given to each customer is remarkable!I bought the wrong phone in hopes she would get it working.  She worked on it for FOUR HOURS! Her patience is to be commended.  Gotta love a dedicated employee!  I will return with the correct phone next time and look forward to having her assist me again.",2
The best telecommunication company in the US!,2
"Is it the best internet...NoIs it the fastest....NoBut I find it to be very reliable and fast enough for my needs.It's reasonably priced, has no data caps and you don't need a land line to get it. Which in an area prone to bad storms and downed lines is important.I'm also able to stream multiple televisions with no problems so I've been able to cut the cable and halve my internet and television bills. (I now use youtube tv instead of comcast)When I've had to call customer service, they've always been very helpful and diligent in solving any problems I have had. They've also been very open and admitted if the problem was on their side and not tried to blame me like some internet companies I know.So overall I give them 5 stars. They're just starting out as a home internet provider and I think they're doing a great job. Like anyone just starting out, they're not perfect. They are, however, determined to give you the best internet possible.",2
I am a small business owner in town and I go to the local Oxnard T-Mobile at the Esplanade center. I absolutely love the staff they are so enormously helpful and honest which is hard to come by these days. The manager Jesus always treats us like we’re family and when we walk in the door they say our name and they all really seem like they want to do their utmost to make you happy that seems to be the very most important thing which I appreciate a lot because I’m always really happy especially when I walk out of there with a new thing. I’ve been going to Sprint for years and I’m excited to see all the T-Mobile has to offer us  as we transition from sprint to T-Mobile. I remember the days that when I was at my office I couldn’t except square payments because I had no Internet and now I do even though I don’t pay extra it’s on my phone and I like that. I really like the service and customer service when I call is also exemplary  and I appreciate that. I just came on here to just praise the Oxnard team mobile with manager Jesus . It’s awesome To go to a contemporary store and feel the hometown feeling by way of customer service. Thank you so much from Patti,2
"I must say that having Sprint acquired by T-Mobile has certainly made it difficult to get my phone serviced.  But, today, in Idaho Falls was an exception.  I was trying to send T-mobile my phone to get the screen repaired and the loaner phone that they sent to me just would not work despite spending two hours on the phone with their service people.  So, they directed me to a sprint/tmobile outlet in Idaho Falls in a shopping mall where I was lucky to encounter Emett. Emett used to be in the military until his eardrums were destroyed and he was returned to civilian life. Emett pointed out that T-mobile does not engage in repairs at their stores as Sprint did (bad change I must say), but he would do everything he could to try to get my loaner phone working.  And so as he ran between me and other customers he ultimately fixed my phone!  He was great and I'm sure would have been a Sprint superstar- too bad Sprint is disappearing.  But Emett did for me what Sprint would have done and I am so grateful!",2
"Went to the T Mobil Store at 10670 Culebra Road and W Loop 1604 in San Antonio and worked with Rachelle to correct the Billing on our cell phone service.  Rachelle listened to what had happened took our contract and went in the back office.  When she return we had good news.  The bill got straightened out to our satisfaction.  Rachelle is the Assistant Store Manager.  She knows how to treat people and knows what customer satisfaction means.  We are seniors ages 76 and 77 and so often are not treated with the Respect and Dignity that Rachelle showed to us.  In addition Rachelle reset our cloud names that were misspelled and downloaded the yahoo mail app so we could access mail on our cell phone.  Rachelle is a Breath of Fresh air, she is one of a kind and a Excellent T Mobil Employee.  She deserves a merit increase and if I had a business I would hire Rachelle in a blink of an eye, which my friends is faster than a New York Minute.  Thank you Rachelle for your Kindness and Patience with us to get our billing issue resolved.",2
"Yesterday, October 27th 2021, I went to T-Mobile on Hull Street store number 637D, and to my surprise I was helped by a young lady by the name of ABENI PAGE. She went above and beyond to help me with a situation pertaining to my phone. I have been to several other locations of T-Mobile in the Hampton roads area. All of the representatives were unable to help me with my situation. Ms. ABIEN PAGE, without hesitation knew exactly what she was doing! She was knowledgeable and very helpful and able to multitask as well not to ignore any other customers in the store. ABENI PAGE, is deserving of a pay increase. She is an essential employee of T-Mobile and should be recognized. She restored my faith in T-Mobile. Perhaps she can offer something more to T-Mobile, if every representative was trained to obtain her qualities, there would be no negative posts about T-Mobile. I was so impressed with this young lady that I'm not stopping here! I will take time to personally contact Isaiah Johnson so he is well aware of a fabulous employee that's representing T-Mobile! Thank you ABENI PAGE for your time, for your assistance and restoring faith in my choosing T-Mobile and leaving Verizon.",2
"I contacted TMobile on several occasions to request they mail bills to my Mom for her cell phone account without any success. They could not explain why they stopped mailing bills to her because she NEVER requested paperless statements!!!!! I was given the run around so many times I made decision to switch her cell phone to my cell phone carrier.  The worse customer no service I ever experienced!!!!I physically went to a T-Mobile store and spoke to the most awesome, professional customer service rep named Yvette (Brass Mill Mall-Waterbury, Ct.) She listened to my story and immediately took action to assist me.  Yvette went above and beyond the call of duty.  She was able to honor my request to have bills mailed to my Mom after spending several minutes on the phone with her fellow TMobile colleague and advising him how important it was to service and satisfy the customer. I'm so happy she was able to resolve this situation and illustrate the true meaning of a customer advocate.  Her patience and determination to make every effort to assist me was truly awesome. Yvette 's superb skills and efforts to resolve this very simple request are the only reason I decided not to switch to another carrier.   Thank you Yvette!!!!!!",2
"I recently became a t mobile customer.  I made the decision to switch from Verizon because of the great offer they gave me.  As the months went buy  I asked about the $200 that was suppose to be credited to my account.  So they told me that they divide it up and credit my account on a monthly basis, and it takes a month or so to hit my account. So I finally realized that something wasn’t right.  Instead of getting the $200 I was promised I only got $100.  Apparently what happened, I was given the wrong amount by someone who no longer works there.   I was disappointed but Emanuel was awesome.  He took to the phone to call customers service to get things straightened out.  It took 30 minutes or so.  The first time calling didn’t get anywhere but he was determined to fix my situation. Called back and asked for a supervisor and finally got through.  He explained the situation again. This time they finally worked with him and was able to get my a credit for the difference. I was very appreciative and he wasn’t about to give up.   I am an Assistant Operations Manager for Rite Aid. I know what great service is.    This young man has great customer service skills. If you are looking to switch or get a new service he is up on the deals and is willing to go above and beyond.  Go see Emanuel at T Mobile in the Loop in Methuen   You won’t be disappointed.",2
Gerardo is the best sale associate super funny sweet kind and helpful highly recommend him,2
I've been with T-Mobile for over a year very reliable I love their company,2
Very professional and competent service. Store is wll organized and managed.,2
I want to thank to Felix for the excellent customer service,2
Nothing to complain. Tmobile is the best ever!,2
"I needed a case and new glass protector on my phone.  I dread this kind of errand.  My past experience with another company, was aggravating because of the attitude and lack of help. Today I went to the T-Mobile on Main St. in North Tewksbury and had an entirely different experience.  Armando was GREAT!  I left there very happy.  Next time I will not dread the errand at all.  Thank you Armando!",2
"Having trouble with reception on my A32.  I went into a T Mobile store, and a young man named Eli helped me.  As soon as I walked into the store, Eli acknowledged me, and said he would be with me in a moment (normally, I am ignored).  Eli was very kind and helpful to me, and the next customers who came in after me, giving them information quickly to help.T Mobile is lucky to have someone like Eli on their team.",2
"Honestly, I am really surprised at the low scores of these consumers, because I cannot say enough about how well T-Mobile has really take care of me, specifically Phil ID#2196859.  In fact this man single handedly, made me have a complete different view of cellphone providers, that I have personally encountered in my 42 years. Most companies, are out to dupe their customers into hidden fees, excessive charges that were not there during sign up and once the get you in, you are trapped in the endless cycle of more and more fees and customer service calls. Well, this employee, Phil ID#2196859, single handedly change the game of cellphone customer service providers.I am a semi new customer, for me it is because I usually pick a company, and stick with them, as long as they are treating me like a valuable piece to a successful business.  This is any business, multi billion dollar business, to the local mom and pop business that has been open since the beginning of time. Customer service is the road for businesses to connect with their customers, customer service should be looked at as a reflection of how a businesses history is with their customers, but I want to say, that sometimes that reflection is fabricated.I had had issues with my phone, it's a new phone and I have already had to replace it three times, it's not a top tier cellphone but I don't mind all that, bells and whistles are not my thing. Function and Accessibility is all I care about. But I need my cellphone to work, I use my phone for work and this phone I got at sign up, crashes every two seconds, so my original complaint was only directed to the phone not my service. I actually had a semi hard time trying to trade my original phone back or have it replaced even though I had that specific phone for two days literally and not exactly two, it was more like 36 hours. But I requested to speak to a supervisor and she apologized for the inconvenience of the previous specialist behavior that his behavior was not what T-Mobile stands for.  She was very kind, and seemed to have fix everything, I had a new phone arriving, with a return label for the the broken one.I got my new bill, and not only was the charges that has previously been credited was back. She had not done what she had said she would do.  But I am a very fair person, I wasn't angry at all. I didn't know what had happened, it could have very well be within the system but it was my bottom line. My decision to call T-Mobile was ultimately to part ways or at least find out what I need to do to close my account, even if there was a charge.  But T-Mobile must have felt my vibe coming through the phone and sent in the he bug guns, because this is where Phil stepped in.I wanna also say, I am writing this review, on my experience with them, because of this particular person. Everything that is stated here is 100% truth, I find it unethical to write reviews that are fabricated for an incentive for that person or company. And I kind of feel like the sheer amount of bad reviews isn't and shouldn't reflect your decisions about T-Mobile, they make it extremely easy, and they also give some bad credit a chance without exuberant price fluctuations. T-Mobile in my opinion is highly underrated and I also believe majority of these reviews are baseless and not accurate.When I got Phil on the line it truly was a huge blessing for me and my family. As I have been dealing with these cellphones for a couple months and to be honest I don't have the energy.  My husband is in ICU and my brother just passed from Covid. And I don't think that I would be a customer if it weren't for Phil.  He was genuinely a very kind person, he should amazing customer service skills, had a clear understanding of his job, and executed a job with such professionalism, and care that I felt so grateful that I came directly here to make sure he gets recognized and If I could speak to his supervisor, I would say.. if you had about 3000 Phil's, within this company they would have five stars everywhere, the supervisor that did not do what she she promised, was no where near a professional as he was. And I honestly from the bottom of my heart, and a lifetime customer because of Phil. I cannot stress enough, him being a kind person was so important in this situation. nd he did just that and I can't tell you enough how he made my day turn completely around, I am truly grateful to this gentleman and if you are reading this Phil, thank you again!",2
Couldn't be more pleased with the sales representatives.  Both Henley & Ruth couldn't have done more as they both were well informed; giving us the information we needed & answering our questions. Thanks to both!!!,2
"I have to make a review about this T-Mobile company.  If I only knew about how excellent their customer service are, I would have switched to them a long time ago.  I only been with this company this year and so far, they have given me a lot of wonderful perks considering I only a prepaid customer.  I wish I can remember all of the customer service staff I have spoken to re: my account, the latest one was Jorge (1878975), he was so helpful to me.  He was very patient and took care of my concerns re: travel abroad and connections.  What a wonderful customer service staff.  I am giving him 5 stars for taking care of me and my t-mobile needs.  You guys deserve recognition for your excellent service.",2

"I had a fantastic experience with an associate in Columbus Ohio at the T-mobile store on Sawmill. The one around the cornee from Trader Joe's. I was having issues with my phone and they were out of a cord. So I went to the other one down the street. There they checked my cord and told me it might be a phone issue and that I would need to forfeit my phone and they would send it in to check something and that would cost me money and time. Something told me to go back to the other t-mobile and get a second opinion. When I did the associate Crystal told me my phone was still under warranty and so I could get a new phone for $5.00. The phone only took 3 days to come in. And when I went back to pick it up she helped me port everything over. Even figured out how to get it to save my dreams which I recorded on the recorder. She was excellent, so helpful, and had all the answers. Plus she was a delight to work with. My new phone is working beautifully now. Thanks for the incredible service!",2

"We went to the TMobile in Centerra, Store 228 and spoke to Alex.  We weren't sure if we wanted to purchase a new phone because one of ours was always in need of repair.  He showed us every option from trading in to buying a new one, to adding a line.  He was so patient, respectful and professional.  We have to let T-Mobile know that Alex should be commended.  We did buy a new phone and he did explain everything to us.  We have been with T-Mobile for 24 years from when it was Voicestream.  Thank you Alex",2
Getting new service was so non hassle. So much that I ordered a phone for my daughter and then after receiving hers I ordered myself one. I was a Sprint customer for 10+ years and it was overall good service. I appreciate a company that appreciates my business like what I’ve seen so far with with you.,2
"I want to give accolades to 3 people at the Ames store ABSN store #402.573.5678 in Omaha, NE. Amir, Taleigha & Robin did so much to resolve my issues. This was my 2nd time in the store for this issue. Amir was helping me and through no fault of his own, I was overwhelmed with the whole process of trying to get a new phone. WiFi was terribly slow so he couldn't access my account. My phone was too old for a TMobile sim card. A new phone would cause problems for the other two people on the account. It just wasn't good so, I left. Today was stellar! Amir remembered me so I didn't have repeat my issue. WiFi was working so he quickly found my account & introduced the phone I was eligible for. He and Taleigha and Robin worked together to quickly get my new phone working. I am a senior citizen & they took the time explain things to me. They didn't make me feel stupid. They even brought me a chair to sit in while things were getting done. I expressed that with the new phone, I might be able to hear my phone music through my car. They offered to set it up. They'd already done enough so I talked them out of it. I walked out of the store floating on cloud nine. Thanks to these 3 people.",2
"I am new to T-mobile.  I am coming from verizon, the most awful copany in cell service I have ever dealt with.  I called them and could not get a person.  They force the chat option where robots answer questions and if you can get a human, they spew the same garbage.  I paid $70 and stayed one month.  I called T-mobile, got a person right away. Normal for new service.  I had to call customer service through 611 and got a person pretty quickly.  The first gal did not get my issue taken care of but since I found 2 more things I needed help with, I got someone who went beyound and called verizon to get my account number to port my number properly.  The call hung up immediately when the port was successful.  Took a little time but I got it done.  In fact, just a second ago I got a call verifying everything I needed taken care was taken care of.  Number  ported, got my netflix, and hotspot now works.  I got a hold of a person.  Verizon no longer answers their phones at the stores.  This even says so on thier answering machine on all 3 stores in Lincoln NE.  I went in and was told to open in a browser and figure it out.  I walked out.  Very disappointing experience.  I spent hours trying to sinc the ap and the phone and while their end said it was successful, I could not log in no matter how many magic numbers they sent me.  Nothing worked.  The phone will NOT work without the ap.  I had to enter in all information 17 times the first time and it kept erasing everything and putting me back to the beginning.  I only did it 6 times the second before I called T-mobile.  The ap is optional with T-mobile.  Maybe it is not all that good or maybe it is.  Either way I can chat from my laptop if I have the time or I can dial 611 and spend a couple minutes getting around their answering system to see if it is a quick fix or your issue is on their phone menu. The first rep tried and was really nice. She might be new.  The second rep spoke better English and that helps because I am hard of hearing.  The 3rd rep was in chat and she helped me with the rest of set up.  Then she called back to make sure I got everything I needed for my new service.  So far so good.  I rarely call a cell phone carrier so I hope to have many years of good service.  Way better than verizon in customer service.  I can't tell you anything about cell service because I was not able to use any other service other than call or text and a lot of the time they wanted me to connect to the internet and data did not work.  Very happy right now.",2
"@TMobileWade Green & Travis Bright #11305 are the BEST customer care consultants EVER..Travis stayed on a call with me thru 4 depts, 3 representatives (1 hung up in our face on purpose), that took 1 hour, 15 mins 11 secs...Wade answered my text after hours and had his Manager resolve my concern and offered to work late into the evening to close my issue out for me because of my frustration...Now that's taking care of a LOYAL CUSTOMER OF 11 YEARS..THANK YOU TRULY!!#bestguysever #customerserviceleaders #impressed",2

My husband and I went to the T mobile store on 98th and slide near live oaks animal hotel.  We were extremely pleased with Johnathan and Jacob.  They both helped us get the best plan for us.  We got the 55+ plan which also gave us Netflix..   Those two were very knowledgeable and got our phones set up and stayed with us until we got everything to our satisfaction.  I would recommend this store to anyone.,2

"As loyal Sprint customers for 20+ years (we switched once and hated it, so back to Sprint we went) we were saddened by the merger announcement. My  husband's phone died recently and we went to get a new on at T-mobile, our very first experience with them.  It didn't start out great, but between multiple staff members and Chris & Vikas over in the customer support phone center were a true pleasure to deal with.  We spent 6 hours in the T-mobile store and didn't even walk out with a working phone and we're still happy with the outcome and will be back tomorrow to get a new phone. We appreciate all the help and assistance in getting my husband back up on the grid.",2
I went to a Columbus location upper Arlington a suburb of Columbus Ohio. I went to a T-Mobile there and the kids that help me his name was Chase and Charles. They were amazing especially Chase he went to great links to help me so much that I went and bought him a Starbucks while he download in my old phone to my new phone.

My T-Mobile Expert is Isaac Moreno.  There are truly not enough stars to express my appreciation. He is very knowledgeable and technically astute.

"Well, I am coming to SHINE some SUNLIGHT about my T-Mobile!  I’ve had an OVERALL GREAT experience with T-MOBILE. Like with ANY company, they have their kinks to work out, but MY experience has been, pretty much, GREAT. Let me start by saying I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the CHAT customer service versus calling in. The CHAT customer service is 100% satisfactory with me! They haven’t missed a beat(5-0) with whatever I need! Granted my issues aren’t MAJOR, but they are friendly, fast, professional, and willing to go the extra mile without being promoted. My daughter has Verizon wireless and my service picks up where hers doesn’t and vice versa(at times). I enjoy my T-Mobile.",2
"7/6/21 I visited T-Mobile in Moses Lake ,Wa. I was greeted graciously by Devin and given full attention and excellent costumer service. I had a problem with my I-Pad ,originally purchased at a T-Mobile store in Renton, Wa. Devin magically touched various screens and my problem was solved and my IPad was up and running again. He was very patient and made sure I could reach all my sites before I walked out the door.  Thank you Devin. I am new in Moses Lake and appreciated the confidence you gave me that I could return for any future needs or purchases. Good representation of T-Mobile. You deserve a raise. 😊😎you are a rock star!",2

It was Nicholas' quick actions that resolved my issue and had this happy customer on his way with a new (working) phone.Thank you Nicholas!",2
I love T-Mobile glad to be back with T-Mobile I have sprint sprint was terrible I was with sprint for seven years and I had to leave and get right back with T-Mobile the prices are way better my bill is not high Sprint will always ask me for money every week Sprint is so bad and plus they’re going out of business anyway so I recommend everybody come over to T-Mobile I would never ever go back over to Sprint even if they did go back into their own company I would never ever go back to spring again they treated me so terrible sprint gave me hell for a 7 to 8 years T-Mobile is the best,2

My fiance lost her phone in the river while in Pennsylvania.  We went to the West Goshen Shopping Center and Kristofer couldn't be more helpful.  He helped us get the best deal on the phone we purchased.  He took the time to switch out both our SIM cards and even helped my fiance pick/find a password for her google account until she got all her contacts back.  If I had to get a new phone I would go back to him n Westchester PA even though I live in NY.  He couldn't be friendlier and more helpful!  a+,2

They were very accomodating specially Mr. Zahi Pena. He was very polite,helpful and an demonstrated expertise helping us. Lucky for T-Mobile to have Mr. Zahi Pena. We told him if there's a review moret than a ten or 5 stars, we'll gladly give him that.Thank you, Mr. Zahi Pena.",2
"I want to leave a review so other people can see it. While the representative in the actual store failed me, the representatives in the call center in Tampa have gone above and beyond to help me. At one point I even had to speak to a supervisor, and he was able to fix the situation fairly quickly.I see a lot of negative feedback on this page, and I want others to know that if they are able to fix a situation that they absolutely do.A few weeks ago we took advantage of a promotion on the Galaxy S21 plus phones. They were buy one get one! The lady at the store told us that we could save money by switching are phone plans, and just getting a hotspot for the house... letting me lose a wonderful plan I was grandfathered into. The plan I was originally on is unlimited hotspot through my phone for $25 a month. Instead I was  talked into paying $55 for a hundred gigs a month... yeah that was not fair. Our bill ended up being well over what our original bill was, even before paying on the new device.The representative I spoke to on the phone did the best they could to fix what they could. However I still managed to have to talk to her supervisor, so that he could switch his back to our original plans.Flash Forward to today, I got my new bill update... $150 more than what my original bill is usually. So of course I was angry. I knew I would be paying more since I was paying on a device, and the fact that we have protection plans in place on both of our phones. But $150 was not the right amount...So again I called back, I wanted to speak to the supervisor I talk to you before just because he was familiar with my information prior. He was on another call at the time, so the representative I spoke to spoke it over with his supervisor, and was able to come up with a solution. He solved the problem and Save the Day!My situation was very confusing, it was even confusing for me to have to explain to them. But each representative and supervisor understood and fixed the issue.As I said, the girl inside of the store was terrible. She lied to us up front and cause a whole lot of issues... but thank God for those supervisors at the call center.",2

"Just want to sincerely express appreciation for representative Leslie (9948600) at Clive IA location. She was so incredibly kind,thorough and patient with a ""nontechie"" customer like me. She made me feel my phone switchover and setup was her priority. What a sweetheart!",2
"After installing a new T-Mobile SIM card in my Sprint phone, I had extremely poor service in one particular very rural area near McHenry, Maryland. After spending at least one hour on-line chatting via WiFi with a Sprint representative in an attempt to improve my service, I lost all service for several days. Then, while traveling for a funeral, I took my phone to a T-Mobile store in Windsor, CT, where the store manager, Abigail Surrell, restored my service in about 10 minutes. Now it's better than every. Thank you Abigail. Of course, I have no praise for the original on-line chat representative from Sprint!",2
T-Mobile on Howard Road is fantastic manager and Associates are wonderful they are a great help their patients they take time with you to understand if you're buying a new phone they're awesome definitely recommend to purchase phones from T-Mobile on Howard Road in Rochester New York,2
"I needed faster speed for my 5G phone.  I know performance is a matter of device/technology/coverage near my areaI had tried AT&T prepaid, Cricket, Visible, all on the largest/fastest/mostest-whatever unlimited service...My service speed and quality deteriorated with each in the order mentioned above!I decided to try T-Mobile prepaid...  On the speed, they delivered!  A sweet 200 Mbps in my area!Within the same week, I went back to my local T-Mobile store to switch from prepaid to postpaid, so I can explore and benefit from some of the additional perks on postpaid.  I activated 3 lines on postpaid Magenta Max.On the cost includes all fees and taxes, they delivered!On the speed on postpaid, they delivered!On the perks with the Tuesdays app...  I'm still waiting to find something that appeals me enough to go get it, but this is far from a dealbreaker!On the additional add-ons (included in Magenta Max), they delivered!  The SCAM Shield works good.  The DIGITIS app works good and with that, an additional phone number provided to preserve additional confidentiality when dialing out.  All that included in my Magenta Max monthly plan, in addition to unlimited text, talk and data!  On all this, they delivered!On service, over the phone, I wish I had written down the name of the person I spoke with to provide specific kudos to that person!  First, yes, service is over the phone, not self-service via a web page, you actually speak with a human!  She handled my questions and responded with clear information that was all accurate.  She ended the call by saying she was going on vacation but she would contact me once she had returned...  Me, based on all my previous customer service experience, I had forgot about this, assuming I would never get a call back...  But guess what?  Exactly on the day she had said to be back, the phone rings and there she was, following-up on my request!  I had a remaining question and she committed to address it herself directly, so I don't have to go through repeating my story again, and that she would call me back in about 3 days on this!  On customer service, not only they delivered but exceeded my expectations!From my local T-Mobile, I also received the same experience, very courteous, speedy and clear explanations.  On the locally provided service, T-Mobile delivered as well!I do not receive compensation for my review and I am not affiliated with T-Mobile in any ways.  I am just a happy customer!",2

"WOW...Courtney Silas who is the Store Manager and Glenn Ordway.Talk about unbelievable knowledge and service. I went to the Oakleaf store with a slew of questions because I am coming over from Sprint, and because of that I had a few hiccups due to the merger not at either Agents Fault.  But to no avail they jumped into action with a solution that works out for me in the end. I can't believe how informative and welcoming these 2 were and if you ever are in the area please be sure to ask for either one of them, they make you feel like Family which is important in this time and age. I am THRILLED to say I am a forever T-Mobile customer...  Thank You again Courtney and Glenn..Respectfully,Alyse V.",2
"We've been with T-Mobile for 8+ years now, by necessity, as they are the only ones who provide service at our location (despite the fact that we live in big city). Both T-Mobile's coverage and customer service continue to vastly improve. It used to be somewhat frustrating, but their customer service is much faster and more helpful than it used to be. My billing issues were resolved by phone within 20 minutes (including time to connect to a rep), kindly and to our satisfaction. Their rollout of 5G is improving our coverage. We have gone from begrudging customers to happy customers, and will continue with them even if other carriers fix their coverage. Another perk is a new store close to our house with by great service & short waits.",2

Anthony from Shakopee MN was awesome and resolved all questions/concerns!,2
I got a question. Is it an invasion of privacy. Is it proper protocol? when you go into T-Mobile(or now sprint also) they ask you for your driver's license and you comply. They  take a picture of you and your driver's license. Sometimes your driver's license is all. That bothers me.,2
Edit☆ updated from 2 stars to 5ok so they called me back I'm so glad- a supervisor reviewed one of my bad surveys and reviewed my case. She called this morning / apologized and took care of my issue with no problem- this is the TMobile I've known for years.. so grateful!!1st/ initial review-I'm being generous I've been with tmobile for 14 yrs - added family as well. Up until recently the customer service has been great now.. not at all. Instead of customer service being accountable for issues - the issues are passed on for others to handle [ and noone calls me back to update me] I was in customer  service for 20 yrs- never a good sign when customer service goes downhill/ every customer should matter..Got me rethinking my loyalty,2

I came across these reviews and had to leave one for myself.  I've been a TMobile customer since 2013.  I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Customer service is the best I've ever delt with.  They know what they're talking about and have resolved the few minor issues that I've encountered over the past eight years.  My bills are always correct.  If I could rate them 100 stars I would,2
"I went through 3 days waiting to resolve the purchase of iPad 8 plus and a Samsung Tablet. After 7 years with T-Mobile this was my first difficult experience. With that being said I decided to call T-Mobile about this situation and the T-Mobile Professional, Exceptional,Patient, Alexus in Birmingham, was an absolute Gem in resolving a three day frustrating experience. I am a retired Accounting Manager from a multi franchise organization and Trust me when I tell you, T-Mobile, You have the Best of the Best in this young lady! She turned an absolute mess into a, “ I love T-Mobile moment! “ if I were not retired I’d be trying to steal Alexus from you as I know from experience how very difficult it is to find anyone with the ability to change a customers state of emotions from zero to 60 in just a few moments. It’s important to Employees to know the impact they’ve had in the company that keeps your customers coming back. It’s not the product it’s the Representatives that keep your customers with T-Mobile.Thank You Alexus!",2

"In the world for cell phones; I first started out with a  Black berry. T-Mobile was my carrier. It froze and some how I went to get it looked at but the Sprint rep. came to me and I was dooped into that carrier. I always had a problem with billing. I then came back to T-mobile. I moved to a remote place and traveled often; I felt I had to change my carrier again so I went to Verizon. Customer service by phone was horrible; picking up a new phone at the Roxbury location was awful. Billing was atrocious. I had to abandon ship even though I still owed for the device.  I am now convinced that T-Mobile was always my home. I am back and never leaving again. The Mount Olive location is where I found my first love back. Everyone at this location has been helpful in me obtaining  my new phone. The manger CIHAN HAZER  truly came through. He continued to follow up with me to ensure all my questions and challenges were resolved. He has a great personality, Very knowledgeable as well as very professional.  I would recommend any one who is looking to switch from those other carriers to T-MOBILE. The Mount Olive Location is where it's at.",2
"I just have to say James B from the colorado call center is so nice!!!!! He helped me so much I was so irritated my phone calls kept dropping and texts not sending and he gave me advice he did so many amazing things for me like waive delivery fees, put credit into the account. He was so helpful and he really made me such a happy customer. I have to say this here he was the head senior technician at tmobile and he truly truly cares about the customers. I'm always nervous about who I'm going to get but I was so happy to talk to James B he was so friendly honestly and really made it his goal to do whatever he could to make me happy. He really made me feel comfortable and helped me as much as he could. Anyway, I hope other people get him or anyone else from Colorado call center and they will help you I promise!! Please also leave a review or ask to speak to their supervisor when you have a good experience with someone, we are so used to leaving bad reviews or giving supervisors bad feedback about the representatives, but if someone does a good job please let their supervisors know!",2
"Dylan Von Sloten is an outstanding T-mobile expert. I was impressed with his excellent customer service skills. He demonstrated the ability to carefully listen to my phone issues. He displayed effective people skills in meeting, addressing, and resolving my phone issues. He was pleasant, patient, and knowledgeable in implementing a new phone service for me. I see him as a Valuable T-Mobile employee. If I need to return to T-Mobile store, at 2100 S. E. 164th Ave. suite A106, I prefer to ask for Dylan to assist me.",2
i went to T-mobile store at 2025 N.Bechtle Ave in Springfield Ohio and was greeted as soon as i walked in the employees at this location are extremely knowledgeable in their products and very helpful with the setup of my new a21 phone and helped me get through some of parts that i didn't understand. I would recommend this store and also the great products that T-mobile sells,2
"I had just transferred my cell phone to T-Mobile. But unfortunately the coverage was an adequate so I had to leave. I want to give a huge shout out to Autumn who resides in Colorado Springs. She worked tirelessly on my account getting everything as it should be. T-Mobile has one terrific customer service rep.Autumns skill set, follow-through, and pleasant attitude made me wish I could have stayed with T-Mobile.Please reward her for the wonderful work she does.Mary Ellen Martin",2
T-mobile is #1 in my book. Never had an issue with billing or phone service. They are better and less expensive than others. I have their Revvell phone and for $200 you can't beat it. I'm on my phone all day with calls and research and it keeps on going. .,2
"Wife needed a new phone .. went to store 1001 on 3551 parkway village ct. winston salem, nc. Store mgr. Johnathon was one of the best customer service person. He asked what my wife ( Cathy ) needed and then proceeded to show her several options. He could have up sold her to a more expensive phone but advised her she didn't need to. Also got a great deal ( trade in ). He even called us after the sale to see if everything was good. T mobile has never disappointed us in over 18 years and employees like Johnathon will keep us coming back . Thank You !!!",2
"Well, let's start with, my daughter and I walked in the T-Mobile store with frowns and feeling a bit confused. Leaving Metro Pcs after  25 years wasn't  going to be easy. Being very loyal customers we were very nervous. I must say meeting with Madison Piper Mobile Expert, we soon walked out of store 7842 in Clearwater all smiles. Madison Piper was just very kind and smooth on explaining all information to us. My daughter knows more about these new phones but was confused. I being a senior know nothing about new phones, plans ect felt worried about my choice to switch from Metro Pcs. Let me tell you Miss Madison went over and above what we both expected. In no time we felt relaxed and excited about our purchases and choice. She help me with apps. She showed me how to maintain my phone so I drain less power ect. Madison Piper was awesome. My rating of her and her service was a 10 across all boards, she knows and did her job well. Thank T-Mobile and again, we look forward to a long relationship. Thanks Madison  Piper my daughter and I give you a  ( 10 ) we are Extremely satisfied!",2

Great service very helpful guys I’ll definitely be back!!!!,2
"Tmobile engages in dishonesty. They quote a rate (recorded) when bill comes it is a very different rate!Also, many pockets in southern CA have no service coverage... disappointed!!............The review above was s one star.Tmobile called and remdied the situation to my satisfaction.Any company that cares to do that gets five stars!!",2
OMG... T-Mobile is the best. My screen protector was cracked and they fixed it within minutes. And it was amazingly perfect. I highly recommend T mobile!!!,2
We had a mix up in service for our cell phones.   Kiera from store #3059 was most helpful.  She sorted out our problem with a great deal of patience and overwhelming knowledge.  She showed leadership beyond her years.  We know that she will exceed wherever she placed.  Wonderful experience!!!  We will travel twenty five miles to receive such components service.,2
Had an amazing experience with t-mobile! Juan at the Riverdale store made sure we were happy with the service we were getting as well as the best deal that worked for our large family of cell phone users.,2

"I'd like to compliment the employee, ""Katrina"" at the Denver, Lowry T-Mobile store.  I went in with three cell phones needing to erase one, transfer data and then do the same with the other two.  She put in over an hour of assistance with a smile on her face.  No money transacted, just good plain customer service.  THANKYOU",2
"I'd like to compliment two employees at your Barra Road Biddeford, ME store.  I was in there about 2PM today, 2/14/21.  They arranged for my phone's warranty to be used because the phone stopped working after 2 months.  They did some checking and made this possible with a lot of professionalism and courtesy.

I am a new t-mobile user.  I visited a store in Renoldsburg Oh to ask for help with my Google assistant.  Unfortunately when they replaced my sim card they deleted photos and contacts from my phone.  Devastating. Couldn't get anything back.I went to the Pataskala store and was helped to at least get my apps in the right places and helped me secure backup so this shouldn't happen again. So thankful for Grant and his caring attitude.   I have worked retail and I know how valuable a good employee can be.  He went above and beyond to help me.  Kudos to Grant.,2
"My new Samsung phone crashed after 5 months. Costco wouldn't take it back because it was past their 90 day policy on phones. T-Mobile support asked me to describe the problem, transferred me to Tech Support, who asked me to describe the problem and finished up by saying ""we'll send you a new phone."" That's pretty much the whole story, called on Friday, got the new phone on Monday.",2
"Michelle (T-Mobile, Market St., Flowood, MS), my sales rep/phone tech was extremely nice, first and foremost. Although I had to make a second visit because Tyler the first rep two days earlier was not knowledgeable enough to get my current phone data transferred to my new phone. I left the store without a working phone. For the next two days I tried transferring the data myself to no avail. Today, Michelle went through the exact steps needed to get my data transferred and took less than 15 minutes to complete the process.  My phone is working as it should; very well!!! I’m extremely satisfied with her (Michelle’s) customer service, knowledgeable disposition and kindness.  This’ll be my store wheb I need to return to T-Mobile fir anything cellular because of Michelle, (Flowood, Mississippi store on Market Street).",2

"I have been a customer of Team Mobile for 12 years!Before coming to Team Mobile I experienced all the major cell phone companies.Without a doubt Team Mobile has provided me with the best customer service bar none!  TM Staff are patient and courteous.  Tech support is superlative!Recently I purchased the new TM internet service.  At $50.00 per month for unlimited data this is a steal.  I set and added 3 devices by myself...and I am 74!  It was that easy.I can say I have had a few issues from time to time, but nothing that was not quickly resolved with the friendly and knowledgeable Team Mobile staff.Susan",2
"I have been a customer of T- mobile for well over 18 years now. I Moved to Las Vegas from Seattle Washington. Since being here, I have gone to a couple of T- mobile stores in my area, and I must say that I was NOT pleased with the customer service at either location ! However, I did not give up on locating a T- mobile store, that I would be satisfied with. As time went by, I did find a T- mobile store, close to where I do some of my shopping. The moment that I walked in, I just knew, that I was in the PERFECT T- mobile store. I was Pleasantly surprised. I was Immediately greeted by a friendly staff members, The wait timewas very short. The sales associate was very helpful & knowledgeable. The associate Eddie, and store manager Shiloh, helped me with getting a new phone for my Grandson. They both went above and beyond. I thank them. They now have a customer for LIFE ! So if you are looking for great t- mobile customer service, head over to 6525 N. Decatur Blvd. suite # 130 Las Vegas, Nevada 89131 On Decatur & the 215 (Awesome Store )",2
"I was so impressed with the T-Mobile on Lawrenceville-Suwanne Road, Suwanne, GA.  I am a 65 year old female with limited knowledge about technology.  I young man named Breenen was the customer service representative that waited on me.  He was very patient, informative, professional and had a wonderful demeanor about him.  I think he could see at some point I looked like a deer in headlights and still did not make me feel stupid.  Ha. He gave me a short tutorial before I left. The teaching time and porting of information and number over to the new phone did not take barely 30 minutes.  I had planned to spend a couple of hours. This young man is an asset to your company.",2
I had a very bad experience with in person costumer service a prior day but today I called the technical support team and I was very pleased with Roi. He was very professional and very respectful and he fixed my problem in record time. For that I give him and tmobile a 5 star rating.Have a blessed day.,2
"I cannot believe how great tmobile customer service is. They 100 percent listen and respond with not just no action, we are sorry for your problem. I have had all cell phone companies, spectrum, sprint before tmibile bought them, verizon, and atnt. Tmobile is by far the best customer service I have ever witnessed from a phone company.",2
I received excellent customer service in Bristol CT from Shakira.  I was adding a free line.  I was happy she new what she was doing.  Very friendly and fast.,2
We switched from Verizon because of the high prices and they lowered my bill by 80$ for the wife and I we have also dropped direct tv and have the TVision app and we get there highest package for 50$ with auto pay and that would cost 120$ with direct TV haven’t had any issues or dropped calls.

"Just wanted to take a minute to commend Garion Williams and Darius Powers at store 2RSS in Lexington, SC.These two young men when above and beyond helping us and getting the items we needed but observed them handling some very impatient and rude customers.  They handled everyone with respect and eventually helped everyone to the best of their ability during a very busy time in the store.  They were knowledgeable, professional and just a pleasure to work with.",2
"After experiencing a problem with our Sprint phones, my husband & I decided it was time for new phones. We went to the T-Mobile store in Greece-Ridge Mall, store #350. We were greeted and waited on by Justin.  As we are senior citizens, the newer technologies can seem a little daunting.  Justin was the epitome of a excellent salesman, very patient and knowledgeable about our new phones. Even after we returned home and phoned him numerous times he never showed us anything but professionalism, if he was unable to take our call, he was very prompt in returning it.  This young man made a challenging purchase much easier.  We will encourage any of our friends wishing to upgrade their phone to go to T-Mobile and ask for Justin.  Eileen Klemz",2
Hello my name is Jackie Johnson. I've been a tmobile customer for years. I took my mom in 2 weeks ago for a problem with her phone. Tmobile at 1921-2 Gallatin Pike Madison TN. A young man by the name TRAVELLE  MARSHALL  helped us. His manners were great! He was very patient and knew his stuff. He also said he was new to the job. I think if you had more good employees like this Tmobile could be a better place. Please recognize this young man. Thank you!!,2
"I must commend John Motley the T-Mobile Manager in Atlanta West End store.  I switched my business lines from Sprint to T-Mobile on 21Dec20 after being on the phone with customer service for 3 hours with no resolution.  Mr. Motley was very patient and took his time with me while servicing other customers in the store and on the phone.  He was also coaching two new trainees in the store at the same time. He exemplified exceptional professionalism throughout the 2 hours I was in the store.  He stayed on hold with customer service until he was able correctly switched my phone over to T-Mobile.I called Mr. Motley again on 28Dec20 because my second line was disconnecting the main line. He saved me from returning to the store and worked with customer service again for 2 hours to resolved the issue.  Mr. Motley needs to be compensated for adding value to the West End store.   Mr. Motley! Thank you, for your outstanding work ethics.  Landmark REIG",2
I don't know what these 1 start reviews are. It's either people not understanding what they are signing up for or fake reviews. I've never experienced better customer service. Yes the employees at the stores are ok but that's every service but the experts when you call are just amazing. White glove treatment.,2
4-year customer. Love the customer service and the prices.,2
"T-Mobile is terrible. Constant error messages, getting kicked off shows I'm watching. Shows and websites take forever to load if at all. I have made endless calls to try to get service fixed and it seems they can't. I'm tired of paying for crappy service.",2
"Rafael the store manager at the T-Mobile 700 N. Michigan Avenue location is AMAZING!  After calling the T-Mobile 800 line 4 times & getting nowhere, I finally spoke with Rafael at the store.  I was a very irate customer, but he was polite & professional the whole time. (I did apologize) He did the best he could to rectify a messed up issue. Thank you, Rafael! Customer service is a rough job and he deserves a raise!  I hope his boss sees this and appreciate Rafael's hard work!",2
"Zero Stars....We first went to the new Glendale location... It was HORRIBLE! Employees were sitting on the floor. They were playing their own music very loud. The person who tried to help us page new iphone12 said he didn't know how to trade in our old iPhone so we would have to come back another time. It was so of the worst customer service we have ever had.We left and went to the Capital Rd location in Milwaukee. 5 STARTSKaitlynn is the BEST! We first went to the new Glendale location which was absolutely horrible!!!! We left and went to the capital location and thank goodness. Kaitlynn was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and professional. If it wasn't for her we would have switched to a different company after now than 10years with T-Mobile..",2

I am a Sprint customer and have been since 2016. I recently sent my note 9 in to Asuncion to repair the screen. When I received the phone back they sent the wrong sim card back with my phone. Our local t-mobile store is closed for some odd reason so we traveled 40 miles to get my phone fixed. At first they were not sure but they put all their time and effort into restoring my service! Thank you Quad and Salvador! I appreciate you making something better in my day! Thank goodness 🙏,2
"I give t-mobile 5 stars because through this whole thing,  they have been the most understanding and compassionate business I've encountered!! Without a doubt you can truly see they really care genuinely about their  customers. My bill is high because I've been out of employment a few months but they have stood by my side. As long as I call and keep them informed they are willing to help do whatever they can to keep you running! And now I found a new job,  my bills will be paid up but if it wasn't  for them  helping me keep my phone on, I would of  never found it!

"I am in Fort Collins Colorado. I had a very bad experience with the shift from sprint to T-mobile. Literally have been in the store for hours, probably a total of 15-20 hours over the past couple months to get my small business account cleared up. Ali was the worker who helped me through it and did an excellent job! Some of the best and most diligent customer service I have had. Sal is the manager there and seemed to be helpful as well. My experience with T-mobile has been a difficult one, and if it wasn't for the customer service at the Fort Collins store I would have taken my business account elsewhere. So kudos to Ali for helping us through this",2
"I have been a T-Mobile customer for about fifteen years. I purchased a new phone five days ago and got EXCELLENT service from Joseph and Belle expert reps. I received my phone the next day with free shipping. Walked into T-Mobile at the wellington green mall (Florida) and ALEX went above and beyond to get my new phone working, downloading apps for me because my old phone crashed so I could not transfer my information to the new phone. TMOBILE is my carrier.",2

They were very knowledgeable,  understanding & helpful,  explaining everything & answering all my questions.

I highly recommend T-Mobile !",2
"Left At&t two years ago because At&t was too expensive. I was paying $300 a month on a family plan with five phones. Moved to T-Mobile and my bill was $195 a month. I had 4 issues all solved by US support people. International roaming is great. I have used once a year sometimes more.  No charges at all since T-Mobiles explains what is free and what is charged..   We got to test T-Mobile before switching we knew where my parents live there is only one bar of signal but as to wifi calling it did not matter compared to we live we get nearly full signal.   T-Mobile was very helpful to my parents as to the low signal they sent out extender boxes once in stock free which fixed issue from zero or one bars of signal to 2-3 bars inside.   Once the towers for Sprint are switched to T-mobile my parents will have more signal as Sprint has a tower nearby with out the need for the extender signal boxes.Paying less, free global roaming, and US support no complaints.",2
I was having issues with my phone charging Reba helped me - hooked me up and got me back in the game! Thank you so much life saver!!!,2

"My Galaxy S7 Edge lost the Messages icon on the screen. I called 611 and spoke by phone with an expert. He was unable to fix the problem. I went today to the T Mobile store at 10259 S. Post Oak in Houston. I was very satisfied with the team. I was assisted by Monica who was very motivated to solve my problem. She spent lots of time trying to figure out the resolution. Soon other team members assisted her, including Yuri. They all did google searches, brainstormed, and refused to give up. Monica and her support team solved my problem. I left feeling great about their respect of Covid, their fund of knowledge, and their desire to resolve my problem.",2
"A Young lady Named:Meldina,is the smartest customer service Professional Tech I have had the Pleasure to get My Migration service from Sprint to T-Mobile, Her intelligence is far above these hahoo's in the T-MOBILE phone centers told me I could not move all six phones over unless my daughter who was in Virginia, and my daughter who lives in Huntsville Texas, they said we all had to be in the store at the same time, this young lady did it over the phone in her office wow, I moved six phones from Sprint to T-Mobile and she did not make one mistake first time everything worked all six phones that is incredible thank you Meldina; (of T-MOBILE'S Experts)you're the best.!!!

If I ever had any difficulty again I will see if I can find Daniel. Thanks Daniel!",2
"I am happy to say that I had an excellent experience at T-Mobile on US 19 N Palm Harbor. I am in the age of seniors and really do not have a good hold on all the updated phone perks that is offered now days. Hanisha Watson, the Retail Store Manager, was more than helpful in explaining what phone I needed to accommodate my needs and stay within my budget. She spent 1.5 hours without rushing me to assist with making the right decision. I am most grateful for her knowledge and guidance. Her reassurance to assist me in the future was very comforting. Thank you Hanisha...you are the best! Barbara Ruthberg",2

"I've had T mobile 5 years. They are the best. Not only the best service, but they contributed in a BIG way to those in lockdown during this Covid pandemic at my husband's Nursing Home. The wifi was weak, and everyone there, all 300, were having problems from time to time with a weak wifi. T mobile placed a black box "" booster"" thingy in my husband's room, and everyone now has better wifi thanks to T mobile. Even those not using T mobile because it boosts the house wifi. NOW, people who never get visits from family due to quarantine get "" face time"" better and longer phone time to family they haven't visited since February ! Very important ! Thank you T Mobile for your contribution to the seniors during these harder times. And thank you for great phone service on my phone as well!",2

"I had an inquiry about SIM card replacement. Truly expected an automated response, did get a person though. It was via chat, 7:02pm NY time, anyhow, she was so pleasant, gave me the info. I asked if I could do it in store versus online so I can have my SIM card replaced by someone who actually knows what they are doing. She let me know the total would go up by $10- which is reasonable and if we were still good? What?! She actually did a mental check in with me?! I know our interaction was brief, but after all day on the phone for work myself with a high target, fast paced demand, this little check in was so personable and very welcoming. Liaa, you managed in just seconds to deliver awesome service. Did her job, but added that human touch. Never know who may be on the other side of the screen (as in us customers), and she delivered.",2
I had some trouble  with my phone randomly  dropping calls so I went to go see Joshua  at T-mobile.  not only did he fix the issues but he saved me $50 a  month from my bill. Great customer service and a friendly  atmosphere.,2

"This review on Store # 1645 at Metrocenter location;Let me start out by saying, I was a customer of Verizon for 21 years but Verizon  rates are outrageous for plans now. Coverage for wi fi in my area where I live in a mobile court is bad. Verizon unlimited was out of range as competitors & too many Surcharges added on to cost per month.I looked to TMobile & found exactly what I needed. Seniors  rates, unlimited  everything, could keep my old phone number & I needed to buy new phones anyway because ours were outdated.  TMobile has phones that are 50% off & some free phones depending on plan. For me, I am a senior, retired, on fixed income, needed to lower costs per month.TMobile has everything I needed, at best low rates per line, & bought found 2 phones. My husband only wanted standard new flip mobile phone but I wanted High Tech, 2020 model phone with all the best everything a phone could offer.I bought, Samsung A71 5G.I got it 50% off right now with Senior 55+ Essential  plan, unlimited everything 2 lines.$55 + taxes with Autopay. Per mo.I called the store first to find out if phones I wanted were in stock, a lady Sandra said she had them & would put them aside for us till I could come in.When I went to store Sandra was there, recalled who I was & had the phones waiting there for me. She helped me pick out best choices that would fit for my needs. TMobile has a lot of price ranges to choose  from with phones accessories but Sandra listened to me & helped me choose just what I had said I wanted in my budgeting range. Sandra also made all transfers from old phones to new ones, even keeping same phone numbers. She put all accessories I bought on phones, & let me pick from vary of colors & styles I was looking for.Sandra was excellent in her willingness to help me in anyway I needed. She set up all transfers of photos & contacts & apps, etc. that I asked her to do. She took her time,  wrote out all info I needed to do with me for use when I get home to follow up on. Her customer friendly behavior was by far,""Outstanding""!.I felt after I left store I had the best service for my money & felt like I was assured if I needed anything else from TMobile I would get  supportive quality services here.I am grateful for taking the move to TMobile.Thank you Sandra, & associate Ben, for your service.Sincerely,Sherrie &Dennis P",2
Issues slow or no service.  called talked to Keith in Alabama. What a nice guy. all is good.,2
"I had a billing issue that customer service was not able to fully handle. I asked for the corporate office email and wrote a brief detailed complaint with proof of my billing issue. I was contacted the next day by Vanessa with the corporate office who was excellent, she helped solve my issue and was very helpful, knowledgeable and curious. Thank you, Salimah",2
"Decided to leave Sprint before the rush.  Went to the T Mobile store at N 14th St & Citizens Blvd, Leesburg, Fl.  Met with Briana and Renee.  Bought two Galaxy A71 5G phones and service.  Our plan even beats out our old Sprint plan.  All information in our 6 year old phones transferred with no problem.  The whole process took about 30 minutes. Phones work perfectly.  Service is great.  No regrets.  Many thanks to Briana and Renee for the service and conversation.",2
"Kylie and Brian in Portland Tennessee branch. Are the reason why I will continue to be a T Mobile customer! Superior customer service. Some may say it’s their job to take care of a customer, but they went above and beyond! It wasn’t just their job it was their character! They truly know good customer service",2
"I have had T-Mobile for years, and absolutely no complaints.",2
"We have been T-Mobile customers for 2 years. Today we visited the store on 37th Ave SW Flagler St, Miami, Fl. We needed help with some apps. The associate who took care of us, José, was cordial, helpful, very knowledgeable, quick to explain our issues, pleasant and answered all our questions without hurry. We are in business ourselves so customer service matters greatly when we seek assistance. Jose has an excellent customer service attitude. We left the store very happy and will go back to see him for all our mobile service needs. We give a 10 in overall relaxed atmosphere to this store, no rush till we had all our concerns resolved. Thank you!!Grisel Garcia",2
Jason at the store on Kellogg and Rock is awesome. His customer service skills are great!! He helped me so much today and got me serviced with a sweet phone. 10 stars for Jason!!,2
I would like  to start out by saying that I’ve been a T-Mobile customer a little over 2 years and I’ve always had great experiences with T-Mobile however to day I received exceptional customer service from JASMINE she went above and beyond to help me with a very troublesome situation I was dealing with from the insurance provider assurant JASMINE  did a 3rd party call and stayed on the line for over 30 min until she was able to rectify a problem on assurants behalf that they weren’t willing to help even though they are the ones who were not able to fulfill their end of the bargain and send me a device within the 24 48 hours promised they were saying that it could take up to 6 months or until they receive a phone like mine do to it being on back order however JASMINE from T-Mobile took charge and made sure that I would receive a phone within one business day and that is especially important due to the fact that it was for my special needs son who relies on his phone for safety concerns and I felt that JASMINE was not only doing her job but that she truly cared about the difficult situation I was dealing with and it meant so much to me and I will definitely stay with T-Mobile and their wonder staff !!!,2
I have used TMobile since they were even named T Mobile. They were called Sun Com.  I have found them to ALWAYS be cooperative and do everything in their power to help anyway needed. I would never change from T Mobile just because of their wonderful customer's service@,2
"Here's a breath of fresh air when dealing with a T-Mobile reps., I wanted to change my cell phone carrier, so I stop at 624 Tyvola Rd Ste.104 location for business.  Customer service was excellent from the store manager - Alfredo and Luz the cell phone rep.  These two individuals know their jobs..meaning I was porting over (Six Lines) over from two different carriers and they know how to transfer all of my phones which were different with no problems...and that was quite impressive!!! The manager Alfredo gave me some unbelievable deals that would include taxes if I  left AT&T, and do business with T-Mobile.  So, if you are needing excellent customer service, and knowledgeable rep.  working, and helping you, and possibly get you some great deals on your phone service STOP AT THIS LOCATION. Ask for (Alfredo or Lus)!!!  We now have Netflix on all of my devices, and I didn't get that at AT&T... and paying a (WHOLE LOT MORE), NOW with all my phones at one carrier, I'm saving big-time MONEY!!!  I'm satisfied!!!",2
I was having a lot of random service issues after getting a new phone. Turns out it was just some weird settings and Henry helped me fix them in one minute! He's probably the nicest customer service person I've ever talked to.,2
I would just like to give a shout out to the T-Mobile store on Nellis and Charleston it's manager is doing a wonderful job and he should be commended for that I have been to several stores and this one is absolutely the best!!,2
"I do not get some of the bad reviews. I have had T mobile for over 10 years and they have been great, customer service, price, and overall service is the best in my opinion.  I do recomend T Mobile to my friends and family.",2
I have Metro by T-Mobile. And so far I love it. Always good signal. The employees at their store were very nice and helpful.I had to call them about my bill's due date and they fixed it and gave me 10gs of hotspot for having ro2 be put on hold. Which was only for 90 seconds,2
"I went in T Mobile today, 3 June, 2020. A very nice young lady informed me of the protocol (mask, distancing). She saw that I was waiting for a bit, so she took care of me as I was next in line. She was polite and very helpful, even though there was a lot of pressure on her because there were people waiting, and there were few  employees. Her name is Marium in the  TMobile store 8681. Marium and Andrea were holding the fort down! A couple of the customers were quite rude while waiting to enter the store. Both of these young ladies kept their cool and handled the two of us inside the store while going back and forth outside to explain to the people they would be with them as soon as possible.",2
"Huge thank you to Allie at the Berlin, NJ T mobile store (115 NJ-73 #70) who was the only person willing to hep me. Managers, supervisors, no one would help, but she persisted and was finally able to get me the credits I deserved after T mobile failed to credit me properly for returned equipment and cancellation of account set-up.  If it wasn't for her, it would never have been resolved.  Thank you Allie!  You went above and beyond and it is appreciated.  Too bad not all T mobile workers are as dedicated as you!",2
"My Samsung Note 10 was not allowing me to put in my pin unless it was double . In addition the voice continued to speaking on various times during the process of entering the pin and accessing different applications.As a fed-up customer i tolk the phone to t-mobile on Rockside Rd, Cleveland,  Ohio where a extremely, knowledgeable and easy going young lady Takara knew immediately what the problem was.   Takara relayed the best service I've have ever received from a cell phone company that on and off the phone. When I asked what caused the problems. Takara as well as her manger didn't know . However, Takara made sure i knew how to fix it in case it happened again and also let me know i can come back for anymore assistance I may need. I left the store thanking God for such a wonderful person 🙏 assisting me.",2
"I met a lovely lady at TMobile store in Hyattsville MD, she was so pleasant, knowledgeable about the services provided by TMobile. She was so patient, friendly and easy going, her name is Stella. She never for 1minute frowned nor complained. Please everyone if you ever go to the TMobile at Hyattsville ask for STELLA the perfect customer service personnel.I give her a million stars🌟🌟 🌟🌟 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Keep up the good work Stella",2
I dont know why people hate it so much.  T-Mobile has wide range and affordable price in my opinion,2
"T-Mobile customer service has been outstanding in helping me fix a problem (iPhone issue, not theirs. Every person I have spoke with has gone above and beyond to help me. They're very polite and knowledgable.",2
Had Matthew help me the first time I purchased a phone and he did a great job!! Had me out quick! Came to retune because I decided I wanted a different phone and came in a few days later and Darian helped me and did an amazing job!!! Was very friendly and helpful and I was so happy with customer service here at T-Mobile!,2
"In October 2019, I got cell line with T mobile. It's 1 phone. Over the past 7 months, They have gotten the Bill correct one time. They have been charging me for 2 lines. I've had to go in and get the store manager to correct it. Each time is an hour to hour and a half in the store. I pay the bill on time or early when in the store with the manager. The following month, T-Mobile claims the payment was late though I have the receipts. Then if any of their experts try to make any change, They add on a fee for that the next month. The bill should be about 45.00. The April bill is 96.00 with them claiming I did not pay 28.00 of the last bill thogh done in store with the manager, a 5.00 late invoice fee though the bill was paid on time in the store. At this point, I would recommend any T-Mobile customer should look over all their bill's and see what false charges T-Mobile is placing on them. I would not recommend anyone get a cell contract with T-Mobile.",2
Please let everybody that doesn't know should know t mobile it is absolutely impossible to deal with you get one person on the phone date eventually hang up on you they have no clue how to answer your one of them has been trained in the same way cuz they all have different answers for everything nothing is ever resolved in one phone call then the next day where you were told the night before it is not valid this place is a f****** nightmare of all nightmares on top of that I wanted to store that I bought for phones football lines court cases and it's absolutely despicable excuse for a human being was hitting on my stepdaughter in front of my nine-year-old daughter and swearing he came straight from the sewer I believe believe meet my lawyers handle on that what I find is the funniest thing ever is it day or telephone company or cell phone company and they have no way of calling you back they do not have any Management on the floor ever not just during is Coronavirus is this been going on 4Ever if you are even thinking of joining this company run as fast as you can you'll never get anything resolved they should all over you it's ridiculous I'm sure they'll never show this review but somebody sorrowful e,2
T-mobile has great customer service as long as you are patient and kind! They helped me during the Covid-19 crisis and delayed payments on my business lines for several months. I have been with T-mobile for ten years and they reward loyalty every time I need to contact them. They also helped me change my phone number at no cost. I have multiple business lines with T-mobile and I salute them for offering the additional features to everyone for free during the Covid-19 crisis unlike other phone carriers. 5 stars!,2
Tmobile is a great company.  I've been with them for 17 years.  Like every company they have some issues but they are still the best.  If you are having problems ask for a supervisor and don't take no as an answer.  It's worth it.,2
"Amazing group here at T-mobile, always wanting to help and looking for the best interest of the customer.Customer service is amazing!Product and service is amazing!Looking forward to see T-mobile grow. If there is a merger on the horizon, here is to hoping they stick to the T-mobile way of doing business.",2
Exceptional service was received from Ms. Selina at the 730 Gulfgate Center location.  Was extremely pleased with the customer service that was rendered.,2
"Y'all are lying, 3 weeks ago y'all sent me a promo and my wife and I started an on-line business and we started to make money. We get paid on the internet, you said y'all would help with the virus but unless you have money right now, no you will not help, you don't care even on your site there is no help you just ask for money for donations to help your CEO is a liar my wife and I were 2 paychecks away from actually making it after the bad wreck I had last year cause me to lose my job, my house, and everything I owned. I simply asked to have my internet restored for 24 hours so I could get paid and you couldn't do it because I wasn't a customer yet. Now you sent me a hot spot and I was 9n the cusp of making it. I even asked to turn it on for 2 hours to collect my money and you couldn't do that. My phone credit is messed up because I had AT&T for years and I could not pay my bill because of the wreck I had. So now I am stuck. No T-Mobile did not help they do not care unless you have money, do not tell the American people you are doing everything you can to help cause you are not I don't care what your CEO says cause he is lying 2 hours is all we asked and you would have got your money 2 hours and you couldn't give us that. I know my comments mean nothing to T-Mobile or anyone else it won't change anything but I do know that someone in this country may look at what I have said and think damn 2 hours they couldn't give someone 2 hours in a time of crisis what are they going to do to us when things are normal. Nothing is what they are going to do, I take that back, they definitely know how to apologise really well for why they don't care",2
I am very pleased to say John187780 Has an amazing customer service! Will defenitley continue my service thank you tmobile for having such a great staff!!,2
"I went to T Mobile in Eau Claire Wisconsin and had a young man who helped me his name is Cole he went above and beyond to help me, he was very polite and the nicest young man ever. He deserves a raise for sure. I have a hard time with the technical stuff and he explained it to me, helped me get all set up and did a fantastic job. So thank you Cole you're the best.",2
T-mobile is a great company they assist you with what you need and if they take long to assist you they are just helping somebody else.,2
"On hold for over 10 minutes, Call took almost 45 minutes. Great call other than the wait time. 4761026 did a wonderful job!!!!",2
Well reading all these reviews pretty much scare me. I hope this is not my experience as I am a new T-Mobile customer my husband and myself. I need to say that store 157D in Deerfield Beach Florida is awesome. Dasia and Michael were the best.. they did everything with a smile and they were patient with my husband and myself. I hope to God that these reviews are not true. I guess more will be revealed but for right now I'm a happy new customer to T-Mobile.,2
"Superb customer service, and we know customer service is EVERYTHING!!  There are many T-Mobile ""hubs"", some with negative reviews, but if you want associates who really care, are exceptionally knowledgeable and will clearly explain anything you want to know about your phone or future purchases, go to  T-Mobile @ Rocky Fork Store #4404 at 313 South Hamilton Rd., Suite 1, Gahanna, OH 43230. This is THE place!Case in point: I want to give a shout out to Darius, who along with his crew are the most customer service oriented, knowledgeable, helpful and friendly service reps you will ever encounter, barr NONE. Just EXCEPTIONAL! Tell them Nancy sent you:)",2
"I’m not sure why the other reviews are so negative, I just switched from Verizon to T-Mobile & not only did they get me out of my contract but they credited me every dime + then some so that it covered the cost of my current bill. They have been absolutely wonderful & so helpful, EspeciallyJim the manager of business accounts, as well as the associate Vail. Thank you guys!!!!",2
Best Cell Phone Company! They’re very helpful and very informative.,2

Me and my husband decided to change our phones and walk in to a very happy group of representatives they help us with two new phones help us set them up ! Thank you for such a awesome team !,2
I needed assistance with some information on my project paper and Clark an accounts expert ID 17769277 helped me where he could. It feels good when your carrier is not just listening when you are buying but even when you need help to write a project paper. I have been with T-Mobile since 2006. I am grateful.,2
Anthony is the absolute best. 40523. call him every single time you wont be disappointed. Solves problems quickly and efficiently and overall a friendly and kind person.,2

"I have had service through all of the major carriers either for personal use or business use. For me, T-Mobile has been the most affordable and easiest to use. I love that I can turn my phone on internationally and have service and text and data are free in most countries. I also love the free Wi-Fi on Gogo equipped flights!",2
"I went to the T-Mobile store in Bordentown, nj and was cordially assisted by Brett - who was not only efficient, but totally resolved my phone issue and even let me in the store a few minutes prior to store hour opening.

"John Ea was awesome and his coworker. This is T Mobile in Ephrata, PA. T mobile had plans and phones for my family where we all can stay connected. Good deals in December. I probably took advantage too many deals..lol. T Tuesday is awesome too.",2
"I have had an incredible experience with T-Mobile's customer service agents. I had a situation where my new phone was shipped to me and my apartment didn't accept it due to my name not being on the package (this was my fault). The device ended up being returned. The customer service agent helped me reorder my device and ensured that even though the original promotion was over they would be able to credit my account the full value of the OG promotion. Once my phone arrived, I returned my old device without doing all the necessary steps. They helped me fix these and applied the promotion that I was promised thanks to the thorough notes that all the agents that helped me kept. I couldn't be more pleased with the help I received from T-mobile's customer service team.",2
"Changed service from a large cellular service to T-Mobile today.  The prices were better for the same services. Our T-Mobile cell phone guru, Dillon, was amazingly patient, exceedingly knowledgeable, and very helpful! His service was a huge factor in our making the big change.  Thank you T-Mobile and Dillon!",2

"As my girlfriend and I entered T-Mobile Store 135 (19250 West Lake Houston Parkway, Humble, Texas 77346), Samantha and Eduardo greeted us warmly. During our meeting, Samantha and Eduardo, a formidable and unrivaled team, certainly demonstrated their extensive knowledge of T-Mobile’s advantages compared to other providers and of T-Mobile's products. They answered all our questions in depth including but not limited to coverages, download speeds, Dolby sound, Netflix, transferring data, insurance, and operation of the Samsung Galaxy 10e and 10+ phones.  In fact, they stayed with my girlfriend and me until all our questions had been answered in depth even though it was close to an hour after closing time. Because of their combined expertise, engaging dispositions, and impressive work ethic, we decided to become part of the T-Mobile family.",2

"Our latest experience with T-Mobile Customer Care deserves an A++.  While the TMO towers are getting an upgrade, in our area, the signal strength fluctuates quite a bit.  Contacting TMO Customer Care, we dealt with Judianna. She asked all the right questions, consulted with techs, and got back to us with a solution. Her level of courtesy, patience, and ability to interpret the technology for us, was outstanding.",2

Not bad service. Just wish there was more coverage for outdoors people such as myself. Shout out to Jasmine(1048498) for excellent customer service and professionalism.,2
been with T-Mobile for several months now for the first time I have had nothing but great experience with them from the time I walked in the door till now they've always been prompt courteous everything they said they were going to do they did even when my phone was working incorrectly and I couldn't figure it out they managed to correct it or have the phone returned under warranty I just couldn't have asked for better customer service anywhere then with T-Mobile I was pleasantly surprised. Great team of people to deal with over phone & in the store,2
"Verry bad service, they still money.",2
Last night went to Tmobile in desperate need of a phone on 2nd line since it was smashed and my spouse works for a delivery service where a phone is a MUST. Even talked to Tmobile in the parking lot before I went in. I WAS told I was eligibile for upgrade on 1st line. The store rep told me no I wasnt and I would have to pay $180 to pay the phone off or $250 for the phone. I wasnt expecting that and rushed out. Went back to the same store this morning and I was in a rush to get my spouse the phone within 30 minutes because 30 minutes after that he has to work. KAYLA store associate said the girl last night was NEW which I was hoping for because if she wasn't then this review might of been different. I give a break on the newbies since there is so much to learn. KAYLA got me w/the new phone and otterbox case for $80 in 20 minutes. THANKS KAYLA Store 8705 Warm Springs & Marks Henderson Nevada,2
Great service.  Always answer right always help with tech probs.  Kinda pricey though,2
"Wow! All I gotta say if you don't got t-mobile or you have another phone service. you gotta get t-mobile or cancel that other service for t-mobile. I've been with t-mobile for years. Great service, fast internet. great quality with Netflix included.I redeemed a free whopper at Burger King today.T-mobile has an app called T-mobile Tuesdays that offer free stuff or discounted events. if you don't got t-mobile your losing out on a great company who actually cares about their customers.",2
"Originally, I was paying $140 for two lines that wasn’t a family plan. I called T-Mobile and customer service representative named Arci converted me to a family plan for 2 lines with T-Mobile Essentials plan which allowed me to save $50 each month on my phone bill! She completed the entire request in about 10 min and it was about a 30 min phone call. Thank you for being competent and caring about my issue.",2
"I had something of a phone crisis on my hands, and I went to four T-Mobile stores covering three cities and two states to fix the problem. The only store that truly managed to help me resolve the situation with true professionalism from the staff, was the store on Campbell, south of Ft. Lowell, on the east side of the street in Tucson. The staff was so far superior than the other three stores that I will now only go to them from here on out. They were all courteous, professional, didn't try to sell me something I didn't need (honest), and friendly. The store is slightly difficult to find because it's set in a little south off of Campbell, but there is a pink T-Mobile flag on the street. I highly recommend this store to any T-Mobile customer in Tucson. I'm a teacher and that store gets an ""A.""",2
"Just had the best experience with Iza from tmobile, very informative, sweet, patient and friendly. Wat to go Iza with your customer service skills!!!",2

"I am a T-Mobile customer from Daly City, California and frequent the Westlake store her. I just want to point out the outstanding personalized service I receive whenever I stop in. Glenn,Theo, Leonardo make a point to help me as quickly as possible as well as the other customers because this place is always busy. They are very professional, extremely knowledgable, understanding and they make you feel as welcome as a good friend. I am still recovering from a near fatal concussion a year ago and I must admit I can be difficult sometimes. This All Star team is sensitive to my condition and go the extra mile when serving me. Even when I was healthier and using other carriers I never felt so appreciated as a customer as I do with T-Mobile. To Sprint, Metro and Verizon I felt like a number and to them it was just all about the money. I am thrilled with my new T-Mobile tablet and their network provides faster than lightning speeds for my devices, no issues. Hip Store, music in the groove and a great staff! The Sprint stores inside always feel like you walked into a rental car place. No thanks.",2
Kendra from the Cleveland office did a fantastic job and was a total pleasure to work with. Thank you Kendra for the he fantastic customer service you you gave me today.,2

I had inadvertently made an international call on the wrong phone so I had a rather large bill for that call.David took care of everything for me - he made a call and my bill was reduced by half; in addition our bill will be $5.00 less than before.  I truly am grateful to David's service and kindness.  Thank you, David.",2
"Sarah is great! I told her I would give her 5 stars for helping me. I know that sometimes the service sucks for people, but no one ever comes here when there is something good to say, and I did have a great experience. I am not a shill just in a good mood. Sorry for everyone having problems I've been in your shoes. Hope someday you'll be in mine!",2

I called 611 it took me directly to an amazing guy who totally helped me out. He was very awesome super friendly quick his name was John /Jonathan from Guatemala and his supervisor Luis was absolutely outstanding the service was just exactly what I was hoping for. GREAT PEOPLE! & EXTREMELY HELPFUL!!.I'm so pleased it was so fast & easy I got right on to write a review! They were more helpful than the people here in the T-Mobile stores and so much more friendly!! I will recommend them to everyone!☺☺☺~ Tammy,2
Excellent customer service and in store customer rep. Store at 871 E Commercial Blvd Oakland Park FL 33334.,2

Excellent service ! One representative sales guy helped me with HIGH LEVEL OF PROFESIONISIM his name is RICARDO NORENO ( RICHI ) I highly recommend this guy for his great dedication on customer service on this amazing company if I could rank 10 stars I will for sure do it .,2
I am aware that large corporations like T-Mobile get a lot a bad press but my experience with T-Mobile has been satisfactory so far.,2
"I was having issues with my data on my phone and it got to the point that I thought It was my phone, though it’s practically brand new, hasn’t been a month yet. After 2 days of not having data on my phone a representative at T-Mobile customer care named Alvin saved the day! He was able to get my data back and running and i just want to say Thank you for doing your job right! :) Happy thanksgiving Alvin!",2
I just hung up the phone with T-Mobile and the customer service was great. I spoke with David and i received the best customer service that i have ever received. If this guy doesn’t get a promotion i don’t know what’s up! Literally the best!,2
I love they service customer service is great they treat you with respect,2
"I love T-Mobile!!!  we have had phones with them for years !!  4 lines .  also the BEST customer service.   I went in a store in Derby ks - 200 rock road.  closing time had some questions .  the 2 people working were amazing !!!!.  so helpful , didn't rush me , they didn't get upset about it being closing .  love this store !!  thanks for always being great .",2
Awesome job by Justine. 110% satisfied.,2
I remember how t-mobile used to be and theyve come a long way. Customer service and quality of calls is on point. Only reason i'm even writing this review is because I had a really good experience with their customer service...I know it sounds weird to say but they were super nice and were all over any issues that I had which honestly were minor. The only attitude I got was a positive and caring one from a Brooke(1240482) that helped me through everything and even said she and her team were the ones assigned to me from now on. Assigned....that means I have a personal team I can go to. I dont know about you but thats just awesome.,2
"I've had T-Mobile service for over 19 years (they were Powertel back then) and have seen the company grow into the best in America (my opinion). At one time I had two phones; one with T-Mobile and one with Verizon. The T-Mobile coverage was as good as or better than Verizon in at least 95% of the places I travel. However, my Verizon bill was over $800 more per year.One IMPORTANT piece of advice: Get a quality phone. When I upgraded my phone I found my coverage improved dramatically.",2
The gentleman akeem who helped us was very calm polite and knowledgeable about all the devices great customer service,2
"T-Mobile has really been successful in hiring individuals that are exceptionally skilled in the areas of customer service and in customer retention. I have had really great experiences with each and every interaction(s) I have had with this organization. I particularly wanted to say thank you to two individuals (T-Mobile employees) who in my opinion have really gone above and beyond their assumed job responsibilities to ensure that my family was taken care of with regards to the products received and in the service plan set up for us. Dominic of the Oceanside, CA store off Jefferson and Avacado Rd.  thank you for being so kind and patient when addressing all my questions and concerns to ensure that I had a complete understanding of the plan I had set up. To Darren (employee ID#122613) in the Expert Care Dept. thank you for your genuine care and with your concern for my family over the phone this morning in respect to our needs this month in being able to maintain our data service plan given that we had great financial constraints that were making it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations. You were so kind and understanding. Troubleshooting, you provided great suggestions/ideas on more viable options/methods ultimately ending in a payment arrangement that would accommodate our needs and alleviate some of the financial burdens felt.  Thank you both so much and keep doing what you do!",2
I enjoy being with T-Mobile. Sometimes i feel like I’m talking to zombies over the phone but today i spoke to a woman named Joy from Texas! She was so great to talk to. She answered all my questions and made sure i understood everything! Thank you joy for helping with my questions AND for making sure i knew about “JUMP”.,2
"Greetings:1). I just recently sent in a complaint to T-Mobile about an outstanding matter. I kept good records and sent that in to their corporate offices on a Thursday May 17, 2018.2). On Friday, May 18, 2018 by  I received a reply to my complaint that a member of their executive support team would contact me right away.3). On Saturday May 19, 2018 I received a call from a member of their corporate executive team with an apology from corporate that they had looked into my issue and had seen that the information which I provided was in deed accurate. That they had alerted the collections company and told them to reverse any actions which may have taken against me; they also informed me that they had contacted the credit reporting agency to have if any  negative posted comment about my account removed immediately from their records as it relates to this issue.4).  The member of the corporate executive support team also informed me that if I should observed any further issues with this matter, that I should contact them as soon as possible and they would follow up on the issue.5). This came as a shock to me for I have been with T-Mobil for over 12 years and never rally expected any form of reply from them – to just one customer in the thousands of users that they have? But this demonstrated to me and was told at the same time by the corporate executive support team person who had contacted me, that the  office of the President and CEO, takes their customers care and satisfaction very serious and that their first order of business..is their customers.6). So for those who may be experiencing issues with their account and have not been able to have  them settled, despite all the efforts you are making,  if you keep good and accurate records of the dates and times and the person you have spoken to and what the outcomes were on each call, when you would have reached the limit, send an email or letter to their corporate offices in Bellevue, WA. 98006, and send in a detail explanation, just the facts, and leave out any abusive or insulting words, and request an investigation into your outstanding case.7).  I am sure that when your complaint is received, they will respond to it without delay. It is to their advantage to keep their customers satisfied and if we can send to them issues that we experience, it well help them to provide training and perhaps even allow their technicians more access to prevent fewer complaints from  matters that could be handled at their own level.8). I have not been asked to make this comment by anyone. I am doing so on my on free will, with no promised of any kind of reward from T-Mobile.Kind Regards – CK",2
"Been with T-Mobile for 20+ years, they've consistently provided good coverage, products and they have awesome customer service.  I was in the T-Mobile store in Riverdale, Utah yesterday had several issues with apps not updating, needing to delete some accounts and needed the help of a tech to do it, the service we received was outstanding!  Definitely recommend T-Mobile and the Riverdale store, thank you!!",2
I went to the t mobile store on Iron Point in Folsom.  I received excellent service purchasing a new phone and giving my old phone to my son. I also had to visit them again when I licked my phone and couldn't remember my password.  They are so patient. I dealt with 3 different people and they were all so nice!,2
I transferred two phone lines to T Mobile and I must say I am impressed with their customer service. There was a slight problem with the porting of one phone number. The problem was addressed and taken care of with ease. I am grateful for the excellent customer service I received.,2
"I purchased 2 revvls Feb 28th one for me one for my boyfriend . His works fine mine however completely froze a week later to where neither I or a store rep could factory reset it . So the rep ordered me a replacement on the 7th of march I waited almost 3 weeks calling customer service no one could give me a tracking number no one could tell me when it will arrive nothing ! So I called tech support and they told me after 5 calls that I was supposed to send my old phone in first which requires me to pay shipping why do I have to pay shipping to mail a phone that I already purchased  that has manufacturing issues . So to settle I mail it in through the store 4 days later I receive a text saying they received the phone your new phone is on its way , again no tracking number that was March 26th . Today April 9th still haven't received the phone no tracking number nothing mind you on the phone I purchased I bought a screen cover they're not going to provide me with another scree cover so I have to come out of pocket again for something I already purchased ! I used to live by t mobile not no more they can't tell you anything helpful you can't speak to anyone but reps and the customer service reps give you diffenerent info then the store does it makes no sense ! I JUST WANT MY PHONE I PAID FOR IT 2 BILLS ALREADY WENT THROUGH AND I HAVENT USED IT SINCE MARCH 6th ! Crooks smh",2
"I had been with Verizon(over 4 years), ATT(3 plus years), Metro PCS and Boost mobile and I'm now a happy customer of T Mobile. I don't usually write reviews but I have to say something about the customer service I've received from T Mobile because I see so much bad press about them. But I have nothing bad to say after over a year with them. I get good reception and feel that my monthly bill is reasonable. But what makes me take time out to write this is their customer service reps. Really friendly and helpful. I call often and I always feel like they care and really want to help me. I don't have to wait on hold forever and they always have some awesome promo to give me more for less. Who can say that they are totally satisfied with their mobile carried? This girl can! :)",2
"I went into the store in Florence, Alabama and Lindsey Davis was the best! She explained what I was getting charged for in great details!",2
"Compared to Sprint that i had they have been wonderful, polite and helpful....also saving me a lot of money.... I admit I have only just started with them, but so far everything they have promised they have done...Thank you T-Mobile",2
"My name is Deshanaye Alexander and I created this account just so I can let T-mobile know how FANTASTIC of a customer service rep they have. I have went through many reps the past couple of days. I had finished paying off my leases and wanted to get a new phone and also wanted to add a line to my current plan. Not one person I spoke to before Kristina could give me the right answer. I spoke to people both in the Tmobile store and over the phone and I was getting told different things. I called this morning and I got Kristina as my representative. I explained my situation, I explained what I thought didn't make sense and she understood. She took the time out of her morning to go through several motions to make sure I have got the right deal. She found out what the problem was and she MADE SURE that she FIXED IT! She got the job done promptly. She was very respectful and wanted to make sure she could do everything she needed to help me out. After the results....BOY DID SHE REALLY HELP ME OUT! Kristina was the ONLY one that was able to figure out what the issue was. She did not try to argue with me, she did not tell me that I was wrong...she simply listened to what my issue was and fixed it. If it wasn't for Kristina I probably would not be a customer with Tmobile anymore. I would love to speak to more representatives like her! SHE REALLY NEEDS A PROMOTION OR NEEDS TO BE A MANAGER ASAP! She is great in so many ways that I can't explain and I can't thank her enough for what she has done for me and my family. THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH Kristina. If anyone has an issue, BELIEVE ME she would get it done. I have never wrote a review about a representative and she did so much for me I couldn't go without acknowledging her greatness. ASK FOR KRISTINA she gets the job DONE.",2
"My daughter was in Japan unable to make a call or text, so I called customer service  at 10:30 pm. I was surprised they were able to contacted her in Japan they fixed her communication problem. I am very pleased with t mobile técnical support!",2
"Called customer care, and it only took about 30 seconds from when I dialed the number for the rep to pick up. The nicest rep and the best customer service I've ever had!",2
The only reason I am giving five stars is because of Byron from Albany. He saved me a lot of money when 6 other people I spoke to were not helpful at all. The only reason I stayed with the company is because of Byron from Albany or else I would have switched. Shoutout to Byron!!!,2
I switched from Sprint which are the worst with billing and customer service is poor. All I can say is the customer service for T-Mobile are awesome. I have had no problems dealing with them. No problems with calling either.,2
I was completely satisfied with the help I received. I walked in a bad mood cuz of other issues in my life but walked out very happy.cuz of customer service. Thank you guys😉,2
"I was really upset with T-Mobile in 2017.  Previous review is below.  However, I waited for the next promotion, and took advantage of the BOGO offer.  Their service has been great, no connection issues, so I have change my rating.  The important thing to remember regarding my previous issue (below), is to alway get the name of the person you talked to.  Confirm things you are told over the phone with a supervisor, and the the supervisor's name.  This way, if you have a problem later, you can say who you spoke to and it will give your case credibility.I was so angy, I initially gave 1 star for T-Mobile due to below issue:Over the phone, I called T-Mobile to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile based on their good prices and the fact they were doing a BOGO promotion on the Note 8.  I was assured I could take advantage of the Note 8 promotion when I received the sim cards.   I specifically asked about this because I was concerned about the promotion ending before I get the sim cards.  The girl assured me that it would still be available to me when I get the sim cards.   So, a week later I get the sim cards and go into a T-Mobile corporate store to install the sim cards and port my numbers over.  I told them I wanted to take advantage of the Note 8 promotion as well.  They say the promotion ended 2 days ago, so nothing they can do.  I called T-Mobile and tried to fight this injustice, and no matter how high up I went in rank, the end result was there was nothing they can do for me.   So, basically, they got me to sign up over the phone (30 minutes) and run my social security number, spent 1 hour at the T-Mobile Store, and 1 Hour on the phone after I left the store.  All a waist of time.  I cancelled my service with them, and now I have to drive 20 minutes back to their store to drop off the sim cards to get refunded for those.  You would think they would do something.  It's just very wrong and unfair, and a waste of time.",2
"I had the pleasure of working with a gentleman named Dakota (5116) in the technology help department. My phone had stopped working and would not go past the welcome screen. Dakota took his time and walked me through every little step, he made it extremely painless. I got on the phone in the worst mood and got off of the phone laughing with a fixed phone. Thank you Dakota for making my experience so easy and making my day do a complete 360!-Kelsey",2
"I will have been with The Mobile for a year in July. It started out a little rough but I am completely happy with this company. ANY issue I have had they have fixed. If you want any thing fixed MAKE SURE YOU GET AN AMERICAN if you want to get someone that really understands you in English. I have had issues and gotten representatives that English is not their first language and they never fix the issues. I hang up on anyone that doesn't speak English well when I hear them and keep recalling until I get someone that does understand me. That is the only issue I've ever had with T Mobile. I don't care if I have to keep calling and hanging up until I get someone that understands me because it's worth it to me to get my issue(s) fixed. I love that on Tuesdays customers get cool deals and free stuff. They don't have to do it but they do and I pray they don't merge with Sprint because I HATED Sprint.As for now I have my bill directly taken out of my bank monthly and my bill has actually went down in price by 10 dollars since I started with TMobile. I love this company so much and I can't say it enough. All I have to say is if you have and issue, you haven't spoken with someone that speaks your language correctly or you have someone that is not having a good day. My suggestion is call someone else for customer service until you get your issue taken care of. I'm not joking, they will really work with you if you put in the time to find the right person to speak with. I have been an AT&T customer, a Cricket customer, a Sprint customer, and now a TMOBILE customer. I can tell you right now that Tmobile has done more for me then any  of the ones I have been with. I will be a TMOBILE customer for life if they keep doing what they are doing right now. As I've said I pray they don't merge with Sprint. Sprint customer service is THE WORST I've ever experienced and they gave me a lot of problems more than any company I've ever been with and Cricket a very close second. I have nothing but good things to say about Tmobile and I plan to stay with them as long as they keep thinking about their customers first as they do right now. If by chance they merge with Sprint, I pray TMOBILE makes Sprint conform to what we customers have with TMOBILE. As I've said Sprint is the worst company I've ever dealt with and I left them went to Cricket and then came to TMOBILE and I will stay with TMOBILE because to them it's all about the customers. It is NOT about the customers with the others. Again I want to say I love you TMobile!!! <3 <3 <3",2
"Visited the Oxford Didcot branch. Had poor experience over the phone downgrading me misold me & was about to leave 02. Was greeted by Nathan in store. Extremley empathetic, efficient, honest, understanding and went above & beyond for me. His service is why o2 retained my loyalty. He logged my complaint & did all in his power to provide excellence in service. His manager jamie also supported with my overall experience. Thank you very much didcot. Highly recommend.",2
"It seems that all the 1 star reviews are because of bad customer support, but I didn't have any issues so I didn't run into them. I previously used giff gaff and my family used Plusnet mobile. When Plusnet mobile was shut down, we all decided it was time to switch to a different provider. I chose O2 and got my family to switch and so far my experience has been great! The service is really good and free roaming is amazing. I really like O2 and everyone in my family has had a great experience.",2
"I must say that not every time I needed a help from o2 i got my issue solved. However, this time, Huzesa, answered my call and he explained why my first bill is bigger than what my contract states (first bills are calculated pro-rata) … he was helpful and sorted my query.",2
"I visited the 02 Elgin store recently as my phone contract was due for an upgrade.I was welcomed into the shop and guided to an adviser that could help me. Sorry but I can't remember his name but he was very helpful explaining everything, answering my questions and most of all listening to what I wanted for my next contract. No hard sell but he did advise me of all offers available to me that day.All  upgrade was completed in about 20 minutes and I left the shop happy. Thank you guys at the 02 Elgin shop🙂",2
I popped into O2 Ashford High Street in Kent to upgrade my old phone. I was looked after by Laura who guided me through various options helping me to understand the Pros and Cons. She was honest and straight forward suggesting things I could avoid which would have cost more and I was unlikely to use. On my return the following day she set the phone up transferring the data from the old phone. She checked with me to ensure everything was there. Laura has suggested I come back with the old phone to get £100 once I am happy all the data has successfully gone over.This service was excellent and Laura is the perfect ambassador for O2.,2
"I was on unlimited with o2 I got advised to on to the 250gb as I'm nowhere near even the 250gb I was advised to be put on based on my unlimited usage.I have the best value for money phone deal/data deal combined with excellent Internet signals no matter where i go working in the entire Manchester area.The people I speak to  at 02 are excellent call handlers and sales teams,it reflects on the 02 infrastructure.Mike",2
I had a call with Saket from O2 to help with my account on MyO2. He was very helpful and polite throughout and was respectful of my caution towards sharing details which I had due to past experience of several fraud calls. Very patiently went through the entire process with me and helped me resolve the issue. Thank you so much to Saket.,2
"Customer service worse than non existant, make it close to impossible to contact anyone and when you do they do their very best to cunfuse.  Trying to leave 02 is very difficult, friction being used to the n'th degree.I guess from a O2 profit perspective providing a good service comes second to getting you stuck on  contract that increases massively in price each year and O2 making it as difficult to get out of the contract.",2
"Customer service agent Rohit is the best. Extremely helpful with helping me transfer my old number to new SIM card. Introduce me with loyalty plan 20% off monthly plan fee for my daughter, not pushing me to join but accommodating my new late starting date. Professional and polite.",2
"Popped into the Stafford store this morning to upgrade my iPhone at the end of my existing contract. I’d done my research so I knew exactly what I wanted and the salesman could not have been more helpful. Guided me through transferring all my stuff which took just over an hour on my office internet. Cheers guys and thank you so much, here’s to another 3 trouble free years!",2
"I have contacted O2 couple of times in last month and I must say I was positively surprised about the customer service I have received. I think sometimes the customer service people have been way too polite, which was a bit annoying, but they sorted my issue.Joseph answered my last call and he switched my phone number during the call. He understood I had a few more concerns and he needed a bit of further advice, so he transferred me to Shayda, who set my spend cap and send me an email with a link to get my free subscription.All phone call did not last more than 30 minutes, so hopefully next experience will be again positive oneShame the signal is really bad in rural areas around Cambridge :(",2
I was having problems this morning with my Bank not able to send otp to my mobile. I then realised that my mobile was indicating no service available. After trying to solve the problem on line I got through to an O2 Asion call centre. The agent spent considerable time and patience solving the problem. His efforts were most appreciated.,2
"Had no issue with O2 since 2022. Recent added charges prompted review. Had a spending cap that apparently does not work abroad (did in past) O2 stuffed me with £66 bill but I guess could be worse as I read some dreadful stories.Update, o2 has rectified issue",2
"If this helps to contact. Phoned 202 and chose to cancel, another list and chose other business. Put through to upgrades and complained about bill charges, obviously wrong department and put through to accounts answered almost immediately. Gentleman from Mumbai was excellent, reimbursed the over charges and gave good advice. Round about way of getting there but worked for me, 5 stars for Dominique in Mumbai only not o2.",2
"I was talking to O2 staff member from South Africa amazing person very polite knows what he’s doing really should be training other people how to be talking to customers he knows exactly what he’s saying and he knows exactly what he’s doing. Appreciate all the work and effort that he did for me, his name is Nhlakanipho mtshal thank you very much and thank you for everything. Keep up the good work and to this managers let me tell you that he a great worker and you know how to talk to customers.",2
O2 Kingston Bentalls CentreIf you’ve tech things to solveI highly recommend the kind professional helpOf AJ (Alexander) Assistant Manager at O2He embraced connectivity issue keenly& took time to stay with the situation untilhe found a way to resolve thingsSimply wouldn’t let go until he found the solutionThanks AJ,2
"Great efficient, warm and friendly service from Daphne at 02 branch just now. Resolved issue super quickly. Was outside as shutters opened and she offered nice welcoming friendly service with smile to myself and another gentleman. Exactly what you want from customer service.",2
Great service from Alex at Wakefield 02 store always helpful and sorted things out for usWhen something didn’t go right he did t fob me off he dealt with it himself and made sure all completed would thoroughly recommend him lovely guy thanks Alex,2
Recently stopped to O2 as my contract with 3 had come to an end and they were charging outrageous roaming charges for when I am in Europe. Now for under £10 a month I have free roaming in Europe and a smooth transfer of my mobile number.I buy my own phones and have sim only deals which is the way to go!,2
"My initial contact with O2 was terrible as i was speaking to handlers from abroad who didn’t understand what I was saying and we’re trying to hard sell me products. However, My call was eventually handled by a gentleman called Shervan - he was from Manchester. He was fantastic at understanding my issues and resolved them with his obvious knowledge on O2 products and services, patience, and care. He talked me through my options and provided excellent advice and didn’t push me to buy anything - but made me feel comfortable and confident to purchase an upgrade. I thank him.",2
Called to O2 shop in Abbeycentre Newtownabbey today for a quick query on using my phone abroad. Craig could not have been more helpful he even fixed a glitch on my phone while he was at it!Just as Customer Service should be.,2
"Reymar John, you’ve been fantastic! Your service was outstanding, you listened to every single query and delivery exceptional customer service and handled all discrepancies and queries with ease! 10/10 service thank you!",2
Lacking in knowledge of what my next moves were when my contract was ending I didn't want to rush anything so I wanted to just do a sim only contract. After speaking with Nick and him going through a few different options as well as filling in the gaps in my knowledge he showed me a great deal and even wiped the remainder of my device plan. An absolute pleasure to speak to and if I could have given Nick a 6 star rating I would have,2
"A massive shout out to the staff of the O2 store in Workington today . Their patience has to be applauded for the complex cases I witnessed today including mine while working understaffed . All worked effectively as a team but my big shout out goes to Jan - you are an asset to the store, keep up the good work guys",2
After a very difficult morning being passed around three different people and departments that lasted over an hour I finally spoke to Teagan who solved all of my problems in just a few minutes. Please recognise Teagan for being a star and taking ownership of the problem. The rest of the experience before that was abysmal. I also spoke to a lady called Tolu a few weeks ago. She was also brilliant. Put these two in charge of training the rest of the team please.,2
"I've been heavily critical of O2 in the past, but it seems things are improving. I just rang O2 to sort a relatively technical issue, and was fearing the worst with wait times and level of assistance.7 minutes from dialling to hanging up, query sorted quickly and efficiently. The call was answered within seconds of me completing the menu, and they fixed my account in minutes.I'm usually quick to criticise and slow to praise, so it's only fair to give good reviews when they're deserved!",2
"Alisha was super helpful in paying off my device plan, getting a new sim only tariff that suited my needs and at a cost that I could meet, as well as updating my account details and providing guidance on possible discounts. Absolutely fantastic!",2
"Recent good experience with O2. We got PAYG Sims and topped up with vouchers to activate Big Bundle packages, which have worked exactly as promised, including in the Europe Zone.My husband hit a glitch and was asked to top up another £15 to make a call that should have been covered by the Big Bundle, but we were able to get prompt and helpful customer service from O2 to sort this out.Pleasing to deal with a telco that lives up to its promises!",2
I contacted the webchat to try and sort a cheaper data roaming plan. Yashwi was phenomenal and is a shining example of how to give fantastic and flawless customer service. Yashwi went out of their way to ensure they did everything possible to reach a positive result. Not only have so many of my worries regarding finances been resolved but this interaction and experience has stopped me from ending my custom with O2. Please ensure Yashwi receives the praise they deserve. They are a truly wonderful person!!,2
"Upgraded on the 25th March Uxbridge branch. Lovely young man talked me through the process was professional friendly polite and so knowledgeable. Made the experience simple and timely. Name began with M.27th went back in to make use of the samsung ipad offer and assistance as could not download Whatsap on my new upgrade. A young man YAHYA  very helpful polite , patient , professional and did it all for me. Great customer service just how it should be and credit due.Was advised also if any concerns with the ipad to come back in.Overall a very positive experience at 02 Uxbridge.",2
I've been a customer with O2 for many years and have never had any issues. Recently took out a additional product and struggled to activate the free extra Prime. After 3 attempts (phone calls/mesenger) I managed to get to speak to Ryan who to my relief was from the UK and could understand me 😀 Ryan had the issue sorted in minutes. I was really worried after reading all the bad reviews. Panic over. Happy customer.,2
"Great experience in Scunthorpe branch. Staff were very polite and helpful. In particular a lady called Lisa was amazing, going to great effort to get me the best deal and even compared across phone models. Walked away with a brand new phone with unlimited everything and smart watch for the price better than my previous contract of half the size storage 4gb of data and 2 phone generations before. To top it all off my upfront cost of the phone was waved, £100 knocked off the top and thanks to the current promotion I got some headphones for free. Don't have a single negative thing to say about my experience everything was well explained and I would definitely recommend.",2
"Spoke to Alan from the payment team this morning as I'd falling behind on my bill payments. He was honestly the most helpful person Iv spoken to in customer service for a long time explained what my options were and helped me set up a plan to clear my bill. Was a genuinely nice person, understanding and not patronising at all which I think you need when trying to sort out debt.",2
"I recently got the latest and greatest iPhone via o2, and the process of renewing my contract, and getting a great deal including a free Disney + package, made everything just that little bit sweeter. The agent I dealt with was very professional and polite, even when the line dropped (my fault) he made sure to drop me an email to conclude what we were discussing. Would highly recommend o2.",2
"Went into Cheltenham’s store yesterday as my brother in law, who has a degree of learning difficulties, SIM card was blocked. I have got to give a huge shout out to OLIVER who helped us get through the red tape and resolved the problem. Oliver, thank you so much for your time and patience!",2
The team at the Kings Road London branch are absolutely the best! I’ve been going there for years and the service is consistently great.,2
"I came into the Tunbridge wells shop and was helped by joseph who was incredibly knowledgeable and swapped my eSIM over to a physical one, set up my phone to actually receive data.After spending 2 days with Vodafone trying to fix the issue and only to have it resolved in under 15 minutes by joseph was a real win!",2
"I had a wonderful experience of o2. I signed up for 4 SIM cards (family). We ended up going for another deal just at the end the cooling off period (due to no fault of o2). I thought it would be difficult to leave. It was super easy. Agent Laeeqah was especially helpful. 10/10 to her. service for the period we had the sims was excellent. Great coverage, great connection, and the best international minutes I could find. Will definitely go back in the future.",2
"It took 4 staff, 5 automated systems and a 46 minute phone call to cancel a phone contract of £12 per month, absolutely ridiculous. It would also be useful if the phone line staff spoke fluent English as it's very difficult to understand what they are saying and vice versa. NEVER again will I be an 02 customer!",2
"I would just like to write this review, I spoke to William from 02 and it was a pleasure to speak with him today, he was very thorough, and very helpful with everything we discussed and he helped me out so much, I really appreciate everything he done for me and how lovely he was on the phone. He was an absolute gentleman, they definitely aren't made like that anymore 😀",2
My names Gurmac Singh. I spoke with Ash today and he walked me through ordering my phone as I was having issues and even arranged a call back to see if nothing has gone wrong which I’m awaiting. He had so much patience and knowledge and the customer service was unmatched!,2
"Darron of the 02 The Swan Centre EASTLEIGHHighly recommended Darron ensured we were totally satisfied, well informed and left more than happy to return.Excellent service and put the 02 in Winchester to shame.Go to Eastleigh for all your needs worth the travel you won't regret it! Thankyou Darron 02",2
Writing this on behalf of my brother Michael because he doesn't have an account with trust pilot but he wanted to say Shane from the Customer Service team who spoke to him  around 5:30pm today was very helpful helped him get his PAC code. He mentioned he usually dreads calling phone companies but Shane made it very easy.,2
"Sorry I was angry. I had trouble to login, but after getting through to customer support everything seems to be working fine. Thank You.",2
"I have been to lakeside Thurrock o2 shop for upgrade, been served very quick and nicely done by a worker called Tyler , he does exactly what I asked him , faster and perfection, , I highly recommendThank you",2
"Found myself in a most complex situation regarding a contract I had cancelled during the ‘cooling off’ period.Called into the Derby store and was fortunate to have the attention of the team leader, Jade.This pleasant lady was knowledgeable and helpful and patiently resolved a long standing problem.Credit where credit is due.",2
There's a reason why I stay with 02. Aside from the brilliant tariffs for being a loyal customer it's also the brilliant customer service provided in store.Wanting to upgrade a new phone Rob and Paul at the Stockport store were helpfulness personified. Not only did they text me at my time to be served (so I could go away and have a coffee) Rob also transferred all my data while I did a bit of shopping for an hour.Wouldn't go near another store for a new phone or a provider for a great tariff.,2
"I called on behalf of my Mum, she was with me when I made the call (GDPR ) and 02 was brillant, they offered a great deal so that Mum doesn't have to worry about monies and big expense.",2
"I went into the Watford store and Bill was amazing. He was knowledgeable easy to talk to, pointed out benefits that were tailored to me. Helped me upgrade to a new phone, recycle an old phone, spoke to me about virgin media and overall made me feel very informed and also like I had got a great deal. This guy was brilliant",2
"Where ever I go O2, Where ever I breath O2, Where ever I get in  love O2, where ever I eat O2, Forever O2. past 23 years of Experience of UK and International  Mobile Network and Broadband O2 made me Sing a Song For them its Best For me Just be Kind to them they will return your Kindness back with quality honest and reliable service and they wont leave you your heart without pulse Thank you Again",2
"I am SIM only and generally it is a good experience. I don't appear to have the speeds I had with EE, but I am paying a lot less.However, and I am blaming the pixel 8 for this, it attempted to sign in to my pin code  at least 3 times in my pocket!!Anyway, so then I read you need a puk code and you get it through myO2. So I sign in and then it says you need to get the code from a SMS message.If the SIM is locked, it's a little difficult 🤬Maybe a different process should be advertised?Update: customer service were very helpful and polite and I got the puk code pretty fast.My lesson is, always backup your puk code.",2
I couldn't access my o2 account. Tried virtual assistant hoping to get trough to real life advisor but it wasn't possible because chat with advisor is available only after logging in account which I couldn't. That made me a bit annoyed and I tried to reach out to complain team about this issue but then after emailing I thought ill just try look if o2 have people working on Facebook. And they do. I successfully reached out to advisor on Facebook messenger who sorted it out for me very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised I thought I'd be asked to call customer team on the phone but no. Thank you Facebook team.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 10 years + and have just recently moved a family member over to the service. I had a bit of a complicated request but the advisor I spoke with, Sunil. M was incredibly patient, helpful and efficient! He really went above and beyond, which is rare when contacting any customer service line these days. I am really happy and want to say a big thank you to Sunil for all of his help. He is a credit to the o2 customer service team and I hope he receives this feedback (and a bonus!).",2
O2 have been extremely supportive of us whilst having issues with our partner company.Unfortunately the last few days whilst i have been trying to deal with an issue with the mobile contract i have not been able to get any answers....I have been promised Pac codes then told i cant have them.I have sent an email to complaints team on Tuesday and still havent had a response.There is no way of getting through to anyone who is willing to help or assist me.My business is suffering as  people cannot contact me.I just find it sad that i need help and cant access it,2
"I called O2 about a SIM card that was stolen from my letterbox and used to spend a large amount of money from my bank account on gambling sites. Justin immediately blocked the card, reported the case, and advised on where to go from here including providing the numbers I needed to report to the police and to get in touch with the gambling company and their regulator. Everything was explained perfectly and I could genuinely tell that he was trying his best to help.The best part, I'm not even an O2 customer, so for him to take an hour out of his day to help me is so incredibly appreciated. Not all heroes wear capes (unless you do, but I won't judge you for that).",2
"Despite the overall consensus on here I wanted to spread a little positivity and express what a wonderful experience I’ve just had with Sue in Telesales. She was incredibly kind and patient with me and thanks to her I came away with even more in my tariff for LESS money than I had anticipated! It was a truly wonderful ‘welcome’ to O2 and I sincerely hope others have the joy of dealing with Sue. She was so, so lovely and helpful. Thank you.",2
The sales man had excellent customer service and answered all the questions I had and  broke down all the queries I had. I had tried contacting the service provider but the other agents I had came across were not so helpful and quickly cut me off as I was a new customer.I spoke to Dylan Daniels for over an hour and he didn’t sound agitated or anything by the questions I had. I’d recommended Him over and over again. keep it up Dylan,2
"So far our experience of 02 has been excellent. We have two different numbers with them and I when I took out the second one the costumer service person suggested a way for me to pay less on the first, too, by changing contract. Monthly cost of each sim card is extremely low, and so far the coverage has always been good when out and about.",2
"I again had issue yet response was completely acceptable and I could notice for the 3rd time sice few weeks when contacting o2 customer service that finally things seem to go in right direction, also it was so nice to hear english person on the other site. Well done o2, keep going get this stars",2
"Possibly the best! Had been with O2 for both work and private mobile with no issues, but had a head fit one day in April this year and swapped to another provider (with a numerical name - see my other review!). Biggest mistake ever - ended up changing back to O2 this week and can't complain at all. Had to ring them this morning because of a problem - 2 minutes waiting, then spoke to a very halpful and polite member of staff (Jay?) in the call centre who sorted it in no time! Now I have a great signal wherever I go, and I've stopped pulling out my hair!",2
"Poole store, Imogen and Chris are amazing assets to the team. I’ve had so many problems regarding the upgrade of my phone and probably spent the equivalent to two days in the store and they were lovely and chatting away with me while my baby was fussing. You should be proud to have them apart of the team.",2
Brandon in the Banbury shop was an absolute delight with me today. Kind and patience. He sorted my problem out even though he hadn’t come across it before.Thank you so much Brandon.,2
"After having a lot of trouble with o2 insure sending me a faulty phone twice when claiming on my insurance, I went into the o2 shop on Westwood Cross and Gareth was able to help me get a new phone and get it sorted. He was amazing and the most helpful person I’ve spoken to with o2. Honestly made my day.",2
"Firstly i see alot of negative experience about the customer service but maybe i'm one of the few lucky ones. I just wanted to leave a review because the customer service today was very helpful.I took out a £8 contract with o2 with 30GB data and seemed a pretty good deal, unfortunately i do live out in the rural areas so signal is not the greatest (sometimes dropping to just 3G). It's a shame i'll be leaving because in urban areas you would get up to full bar 4G or even 1-2 bar 5G in city areas.The customer service was a little long winded to get through to different departments but once you're through they were helpful in cancelling my contract. (Although looking at some of the comments here, i hope it doesn't bite back and charge me extra!!)",2
"Spoke to Sivern from South Africa about setting up a new sim contract.  Even after all the current technical problems O2 have had, it was a pleasure to speak to someone who was friendly and competent. Sadly unusual to find someone who it both.Could not ask for a better initial contact with this company. I hope that anyone else in my situation is lucky enough to talk to Sivern",2
"Just visited Salisbury 02 store and had amazing service from Nik!been years since I have since such efficient, charming and swift service for mobile!  Outstanding! Will defo purchase next phone deal with him!",2
Recently came back to o2 after leaving them for a cheaper service. Cheaper isn’t always better!! Came back and wanted to port my numbers. Had to ring customers services and they were nothing but helpful. Took them a few days because of a technical error. I’ll be staying with o2 now!,2
"I have had to call O2 3 times today due to problems with my phone.  I have spoken to a different person each time and each one of them has been polite, friendly and very helpul.  They all knew what they were doing and talked me through what I had to do in a way I understod - not being tech savvy.I read the reviews before I called and was dreading the experience but in fact, it could not have been easier.  Yes a bit of a wait to get through but not too bad.",2
"Rohan via web chat on Saturday morning was very assertive understanding and found me the best deal on o2 switch up! I can say being the most valuable customer with o2 since the age of 15/16 it has been very hard dealing with o2 customer service team in the past. I think they need more colleagues like Rohan not only did he get me the best deal and sort everything out promptly swiftly and smooth, but when I also had another query he diverted me straight away which was bit painful but manage to get what I needed thank you once again Rohan for all your help and support!",2
"I have both a pay monthly phone contract, and a PAYG SIM I use for a router at our holiday home, and I find both work well and are very easy to manage via APPs or website.",2
Today I contacted o2 about my account.I was greeted by a Gentleman called Ashish.In all my years with o2 I have never had such a pleasant conversation with a man who was very knowledgeable about the products and services.  Ashish helped me with my account  query and device so efficiently that I had to come on trust pilot to thank him publicly.  A glowing asset to O2 and I hope they recognise this.   Well done Ashish!,2
"I've been using the O2 SIM only deal at £9.99 per month for a while now, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Service Quality:** The service has been good. I haven't encountered any significant issues with connectivity or customer support. The process of getting the SIM and setting it up was smooth and hassle-free.**Network Performance:** The network works great. I get reliable coverage in most areas, including both urban and rural locations. Data speeds are consistent, and I haven't experienced any dropped calls or prolonged outages.**Value for Money:** At £9.99 per month, this deal offers excellent value. It meets my needs without breaking the bank, and I feel I'm getting a good amount of data, texts, and minutes for the price.**Overall Experience:** So far, so good. I'm satisfied with the O2 SIM only deal and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, reliable mobile plan.In conclusion, if you're seeking a cost-effective and dependable SIM only deal, the O2 plan at £9.99 per month is a solid choice.",2
"Having read the reviews on trustpilot for O2 I was sceptical about the service I was going to receive. I was calling to cancel a contract, Harley, who dealt with me was incredible!! I had no intention of staying with O2 already taking out a sim-only contract with another provider. However after explaining what I could afford to pay and the deals I'd seen online, Harley was able to get me an offer I couldn't refuse.Incredible service and Harley is a credit to the team!",2
"Abigail from your cancellations team went over & above for me today.  She wasn't able to resolve my problem so consulted with her colleagues several times,  she was very patient & listened to my issued & relayed this to relevant people.",2
"In spite of many negative reviews , I  was delivered excellent customer service by Kurt. He was a fantastic active listener. He found a solution for the issue that I had and solved it straight away. It has been about a year since I have been with this company, I called them several times and they did the best . Thank you",2
"Went to O2 yesterday in Telford and she gave me great advice on getting the right phone at the best price.Have been with them for years and not had any problems, that's my experience anyway",2
"Ola Onwunli was excellent! I have just had excellent customer service from Ola. She was polite, professional and incredibly patient with me, as I was getting a bit mixed up. Thank you so much Ola.",2
We had a big issue with my husbands 02 account. We cancelled the account in the correct procedure. But the person we spoke to did not process cancellation correctly and we was going to be charged £320 incorrectly. 02 in Hempstead Valley Gillingham Kent was totally unsupportive and said we was liable and very unhelpful. Not customer focused at all n not interested.We went to 02 in Chatham Kent. We asked for help and the staff where brilliant. Kree (Male assistant) went out of his way to help us big time. He resolved the problem with help of customer services on the phone and his determination with us. It was an error in 02’s staff and want to thank Kree for his totally customer focused service and a fantastic job. Highly recommended to all customers. Do not go to Hempstead Valley Gillingham as not customer focused.,2
"Spent ages with one of the representatives and got nowhere as soon as Christopher got on the phone he dealt with my query quickly and effectively, hats off he turned around a bad experience ! Thank you mate",2
Just spoke to a lovely understanding guy called Gill. He helped me no end even looked at changing my tariff to try and save me some money. Thank you so much for being understanding and patient,2
I had been receiving fraudulent calls offering half price contracts on my existing o2 phone. Extremely convincing scam with the fraudster even giving agent ID then asking to confirm to them my email address (but I knew o2 have it already) so I called and spoke to a man called Ashyun in your call centre who did rigourous security checks and really helped explain what to look out for with these scams. He helped secure my account and did a fantastic job helping me when I was in a very stressful situation.,2
"Lauren at Bexleyheath store was really help full and went beyond my expectations to help resolve changing my pay as you go to pay monthly mobile. I cant recommend this store enough for the help I received this week, very pleased!",2
"This is a five star review for BEDFORD SHOP- The assistance name is Raima.I went in with a problem with my phone contract, I didnt understand how to sort this out and found the 202 customer service not able to help me. Raima was helpful and reassuring, and sorted the issues, going over and above to ensure I had a working phone, she took the time to sort this despite pressure of a busy shop. The customer service was amazing- I had been in to the Cambridge shop in the Grand Arcade and they were unhelpful and rude- Cambridge have a lot to learn from their colleagues in Bedford. A huge thank you to Raima.",2
"Reported a little issue on my last bill to O2 this morning. The matter was resolved by a very responsive, customer service orientated gentleman, Adnan. He is an asset to your company.",2
"Long story short I ordered an upgrade 9th of June, paid my last year off of my old contract in full (£260).Been sent the wrong device and then a broken device, then told it would be sorted and a new phone sent on a next day delivery, 5 weeks ago.  Ive been waiting 8 weeks in total now and still no phone.I've logged over 10 hours of complaints in total, over 7 hours on webchats, I was told last week it would be sorted and a phone would be sent within 5 working days, 7 days later and still no phone, again.  I can't cancel the contract as they said they'll charge me for the device, £1500, which they've never sent.Honestly just stay well clear, I'm going through the ombudsman next week and hopefully they can help resolve this because this is the worst company I have ever dealt with. Customer service is horrendous, I've just been lied to and fobbed off constantly.To add Insult I've been a customer for over 15 years.",2
I visited 02 in Romford Essex. I received excellent service from Charlie and he helped in resolving an issue for me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable.,2
In particular staff in Kingston branch called Monica was amazing and  good customer service. We have four fraud issues recently she has been resolved as soon as possible.,2
"I don’t think I’ve ever spoke to a more understanding and empathetic customer service advisor! Washiela took her time to look into my account, despite me speaking to someone different 45 minutes prior and getting nowhere (who came across as rude and couldn’t wait to get me off the call) Washiela explained everything to my academic knowledge and led me to understand everything that she was telling me. Washiela was extremely empathetic of my financial situation, explained everything perfectly so I understood the following steps. Washiela is a great asset to the o2 customer service team and I strongly believe fellow colleagues could learn a lot from her. Incredible service, thank you again Washiela 🫶🏼",2
Rexth was really helpful and polite I was having trouble with my o2 roaming and helped resolve the issue and made me feel much better.Credit to the company and contributes to why I’ve stayed with o2 for so many years.,2
"Zhed! What an amazing man! I always seem to get people that really go above and beyond to help others and you were one of them. You were patient, kind and actually took time to listen to me! Every woman’s dream! Honestly Zhed thank you so so much! You’re going to make an amazing husband!",2
"I contacted 02 today to discuss my contract that recently ended, l was not looking forward to the call as l am an I.T and Mobile Phone dinosaur and know very little or nothing about Mega Bytes, Giga Bytes or any other Byte.I got through to a Customer Services Officer called Kirsty and all l can say she was an absolute star. She listened to all my questions and responded in a helpful, professional and respectful manner. She explained things clearly and repeated things that l did not understand.Based on my call with Kirsty l will be remaining with 02 for the next 24 months and l also have a clearer understanding of the contract. There was no ""Hard Sell"" or ""Gimmicks"" about better offers, and the icing on the cake is that l have a cheaper monthly bill and my data has been reduced as l never use the amount of data on my contract.I am happy to remain an 02 customer with special thanks to Kirsty. I am still a dinosaur, but l am a much better informed dinosaur.",2
"Great shop experience from the Ashton Under Lyne branch, efficent and knowledgeable.We went into the store to get a sim only deal for my daughters first phone.The week before a helpful team member advised us of the best deal and as we were an O2 customer already that we would get a further 20% off.  There was no hard sell.The following week we went in, a different team member, helped us get the same deal and we were done in less than 20 minutes.Other mobile phone shops i have been too in the past, i have been there ages and often a smell upselling.  This was not the case from this store.  Good work!",2
Spoke to Sivern (South Africa branch)He explained everything very clearly and gave me a better deal than I had chosen online. Friendly but professional and patiently re explained anything I was not sure of the first time explained.,2
I went into my local O2 branch in Meadows Shopping centre Portadown.  I was  greeted by a lovely  man called Gareth. He was very helpful and went above and beyond to explain my account and get me the best deal to suit me . He was very professional and polite. A pleasure to be served by him .,2
"Good experience yesterday when I visited O2 Oxford St store at a time when they were lean on staff. James exercised helpful, flexible, willing customer service keeping queuing customers informed and keeping the queue moving on what appeared to be a busier than expected day. Thanks James!",2
"I ordered on the Sunday & my number was ported& sorted on the Thursday morning ( it would have been a day earlier but  it was after 6 pm on the Tuesday  I wanted to keep my number. Great communications and updates   it went like clockwork. I was with Tesco Mobile for years but after being ignored for 20 mins and blanked by the salesman there....not so much ""I'll be with you soon or you're next"".. just totally ignored. That said 60gb for £9.99 was a saving of £1 per month & FIVE times the data that Tesco were offering.  I've tested the sound quality and it's better believe it or not,even though Tesco piggyback  on  O2 network!. The app is easy to use even to someone who has hit 3 score and 12... Many thanks O2 for a trouble free switch",2
"O2 shop Redhill, Surrey.Fantastic service from Colin who spent a lot of time helping me transfer my old iPhone to a newer one. There is no way I would ever have been able to do it myself as I really struggle with tech stuff. A great member of staff. Very, very much appreciated. Thank you Colin",2
We’ve had our phones for a week now and would like to thank the team at o2crewe for their help especially Olena and Shaun for sorting us both out and making our little dog welcome many thanks and take care,2
Been with o2 mostly all the time since 2003 my first mobile connection. Always had great service and their local store here is very friendly and helpful. Always had good deals for phones and Sims. Recommended.,2
"My experience initially was really bad and quite stressful. I called on the 16th, 17th and 18th of October 2023 to explain my problem that my old number hadn’t ported to my new phone. I was told on the 18th, I’d get a call between 10am and 11am today the 19th of October 2023 and no call arrived. This is a very stressful time for me as I’m currently undergoing treatment for colon cancer and I didn’t have the energy to keep calling and being on hold for 30 minutes each time. I gave it one last attempt and eventually after being put through several departments got through to an advisor called Rikki. Her compassion and customer service was exemplary and she swiftly ensured my old number was ported to ensure I didn’t miss any crucial hospital appointments that get sent to my old number. I can't stress enough how much pressure this hasn’t taken off me during this difficult time. Thank you Rikki for your excellent service! This 5 star rating is for your service!",2
"Easy to apply, changed tariff a few times (glad you can do so easily), eSIM downloaded straight away. Great connection all round. Haven’t had a problem and are pleased with the quick process.",2
"I would like to say a huge thank you to two customer service assistants at 02.Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the first lady I spoke to.She was polite, professional and put me through to BECKY SMITHWho is based in South Africa.I have attempted on many many occasions to get a record of my data usage for a particular day on November 2022. and failed every time.This week I decided to have one last attempt before making an official complaint to 02's head office in Slough. This information is very important to me because  it concerns a court case next week nearly a year after the offence.I was amazed to find Becky was polite,professional and efficient.She found the day I needed and gave me the information. She has promised me and I really do believe her that I will receive an email before Thursday 5th October to help me prove  my case.Many thanks Becky it was such relief to receive such quick and efficient service.Kind regards.Mrs. N. Thomas",2
"Called on a Sunday evening as I had damaged my phone, ordered a new phone as I was due an upgrade In a few months anyway. The caller had to call me back once due to my error, lack of Information that I had to gather for him. Called me back on the dot, sorted and the phone was delivered 10AM on Monday morning! Super quick, helpful service. I've been with 02 for over 5 years now and never had an Issue. Brand new phone, for less than my old phone per month. Thankyouuuuu!!",2
"I visited O2 bon accord and the reception was good. The staff that attended to me on both occassions were lively and ready to help.O2 network in my house, school, and workplace is excellent",2
"Had a very positive and swiftly efficient experience in the SUTTON O2 store today with INTISAR (following a disastrous on line experience yesterday where, after an hour, I was cut off without achieving my change of tariff). INTISAR dealt with me immediately and gave me impeccable advice, finding me the best tariff for my needs. This was further improved at no extra cost because I am also a Virgin customer. I am saving £17 a month and getting a better tariff! Thank you INTISAR for making me feel valued as a customer of over 20 years (unlike O2 online who almost lost me as a customer yesterday and obviously didn't care) THANK YOU",2
"We were with 3 for many many years and after they put up our deal we decided time to move provider. We looked on u switch and found a great deal with 02 but we wanted to get our existing numbers. Our best option go in store and get help to do this. We went to 02 store in Staines. Here we were helped by the Manager Sian ? (Sorry if wrong) who was amazing did everything for us to do with transfer, account etc. could not have been more helpful. 02 kept us informed the whole time. Thank you Sian and 02.",2
"Today, I went into the o2 shop in York, with my two friends to buy a new phone. The sales assistant James was absolutely phenomenal, he made a stressful situation seem so calm. He listened to what I wanted and gave great advice on both the phone and the price. Overall I am so happy with my new phone.James you are an icon!!Anya, Grace and Emily",2
"As a new mum its hard to find the time to complete tasks. I thought I'd call as soon as i had a spare moment to discuss my tariff. Unfortunately the first agent i spoke to was unhelpful, impatient, rude and had the odassitty to hang up the call without answering my query. So much for customer service, she simply couldnt be bothered. This really upset me as i speak and treat others how i wish to be dealt with. I called up again to discuss the same query. I spoke to a lad called Vishal who dealt with the query and helped me change to a better tariff. Well mannered and patient with me and my baby. Treats customers like family and is an asset to the company. If it wasnt for Vishal i would have moved to another company. Thanks Vishal 👍🏽",2
"Up until now we've rarely had issues with o2. Now I'm seriously angry.I desperately need help regarding a code for an offer that was on when we refreshed my daughter's phone in December. We were told that the code -for Galaxy Buds for £1- would arrive via text within 30 days but have heard nothing. Over the last 10 days I have phoned customer services 8 times,for at least 20-30 minutes per call. I still am no closer to getting this resolved. It is extremely frustrating and time consuming. We are seriously considering leaving o2 altogether (5 members of our family,all on pay monthly contracts,some for at least 10 years) . We keep getting palmed off,telling us to wait 48 hours for an email,then it was being escalated and we had to wait another 5 days,it's now been 7 days and nothing. Every time we phone we have to recount the entire story AGAIN,very difficult when all the advisors have extremely strong accents  and we can barely understand them. Still no closer to getting the Galaxy Buds then we were when we tried to sort it ten days ago. Would never recommend o2 to anyone.",2
"Great customer service advisor and technical team member. Andrew contacted me following an issue I reported with a PORT made from Three network to O2, he dealt with the issue swiftly identifying what the cause of it was and resolved the issue with the technical team.Many thanks.",2
"Spoke with Soco, she was lovely and very cheerful. She helped resolve my problem straight away and explained to me why it had happened and how to avoid it in the future. Great experience:)",2
"Honestly i had been with o2 for years, never had an issue at all with them until this week. I would have recommended them to everyone before this ordeal.I had to call every day since monday to try get my issue resolved. I was lied to, dismissed and generally the customer service I had recieved was pretty awful, I dont think I had ever experience such terrible customer service in my life and it changed my view on the company drastically.So why am I giving it 5 stars?. Because finally, after speaking to an agent today my issue was resolved. She was extremely helpful, patient, kind and just the embodiment of the what amazing customer service should be like. She understood my issue, she was honest with me and instead of apologising and dismissing me like other agents before, she LISTENED and took action. From that one agent alone has restored a tiny bit of my faith in the company that I had lost after this whole ordeal. I can't thank her enough. It's good to know there's still some good agents left in the company.",2
"The member of staff at The Strand, London, store was very helpful in getting my iPad all set up for me.Well recommended.",2
I have a 3 account on 02 and I'm having a problem logging in to check my bills and tariff. I called customer service and I spoke to Harrold from the Philippines he was very helpful and I all the information I needed he provided in detail his very very good…and polite,2
Went to Mansfield branch to do an upgrade was served by Mandy and Julie what a credit to the store helped update and transfer data to new phone nothing was too much trouble.,2
Having a lot of problems over a bill called 4times and nobody helpful until today and a young man called Alex sorted it all out a definite asset to o2,2
Would just like to say a big thank you to luke the shop manager at 02 epsom as a pensioner dont always get things the first time but he had the patience of a Saint and a great sense of humour,2
I was helped by an assistant called Carl in the o2 shop in Birkenhead. I can’t recommend him more highly. He sorted out my issues with my phone and went above and beyond to assist me. Thankyou so much for your service 10 out of 10 and much more.,2
Called O2 on Monday regarding a data query and got through to a lovely guy called Jermaine (Manchester based) who was very friendly and helpful! Dealt with my query very quickly and efficiently! A great asset to your team! Hope this feedback gets passed over to him!!,2
Very good spoke with EMMERON she was very helpful and she very good spoke with me she is very kind and friendly I need say thank you very much you definitely do your job ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Called O2 three times but only after talking to a friend did I discover my 2g phone was no longer supported hence why I was not getting service. This should have been spotted, I had mentioned my phone was fourteen years so it should have been picked up. On the plus side I bought a new phone from O2 online. Nice phone for less than £20. Then I saw my old SIM was too big to fit. This is where O2 call centre in Manila did well. I was told I would receive a new Nano SIM, within four to five days, with my old number and my Pay as you Go balance added. This is what happened as described. Very happy now and really I was due a new phone. The only cost was for me was some inconvenience and my new phone. The service, phone calls, nano SIM were all part of the service. Thankyou O2",2
Very good service compared to others 3 networks I had...,2
"HiI went into the Newark branch of 02 today. The gentleman I saw was very helpful. I had not been able to receive phone calls on my Samsung Flip for ages, no signal bars. I assumed it was because a local signal tower had been taken down in my local village. However the gentleman, who I forgot to get his name, said there is hardly any signal on it now and that I should be getting signal as in a different area. The gentleman swapped my sim for a new one, no charge. I then went home and restarted my phone. Nothing no signal bars.I put my phone on aeroplane mode then shut aeroplane mode off. I had tried this before I had had my new sim put in but this did not work, but this time it worked. My phone is now working . Thankyou to the gentleman that helped me at 02 Newark branch he was very understanding and I felt he did everything he could to ensure my phone was set up to work properly and receive a signal.",2
This is to give a big shout out to Chrystian Briggs from your Crystal Peaks shop.He was very patient and helped me to choose a new phone and contract .Nothing was too much trouble for him .He helped me with transferring the data from my old phone on to my new one .I tried to give a review however it stated that this had expired .Thank you,2

"I'm not giving O2 5 stars I am giving it to the lovely lady by the name of Chelsea and her manager who was the only advisor who listened and within an hour she had sorted out the mess the other advisors had made and put me through  hell for 23 days without a phone, numbers that was changed and personal information and data transferred to another phone. A new contract that was broken and the phone turned off and no usage for 23 days on a new contract. I couldn't even phone my family and what if an emergency had occurred. Two phones without usage. The stress this cause me was unbelievable. The advisors who feed me lies and told me that all this would be sorted, they told me to wait first 24 hours then 48 hours, then 5 to 7 days then 5 to 10 days then another 5 to 10 days, and nothing. All this just for a migration of a number. I had in the end had to ring end my contract so I wouldn't be put through customer service, and the quy from the end contract but me through to the wonderful lady Chelsea who within the hour sorted out the mess 30 odd advisors couldn't or wouldn't do in 23 days. shame on them. The lies,the false information and even accusing me of fraud. O2 train those incompetence advisors to do the right thing.....Chelsea you and your manager are stars a big thank you to you for all your help. You know who you are",2
"Contacted o2 via facebook messages, and they re-connected on old number for me within hours, I see people complain about poor service, i suggest instead of telephone call to o2 that you send message via facebook, as I think you will get better response, you also have the added bonus that there is then a record of your conversation in case you do need to escalate anything. however I was very happy with the service I got from the people behind the facebook service of o2",2
So bad. The customer service is worst. They upgrading my contract without my permission and its also a breach of customer data.,2

"Went to the Hanley store for a charging wire/plug, they has exactly what I needed. Staff were friendly and the whole process was efficient.",2

"In my cooling off period and found out a Uswitch deal for o2 had more data for the price I’m currently paying compared to what I had, spoke to retentions about this and they changed my plan without any quibbles, also managed to get the loyalty discount as I have additional sims which I am chuffed about. Better indoors signal with o2 then I had with EE, have signal everywhere now, in my area o2 is actually faster then EE although in central London the network does get slow due to congestion particularly around Tottenham Court Road but it’s still functional, am happy about the service I am receiving!",2

I went to glenrothes 02 store on Friday 17th May 2024 I am 72 years old to ask about an issue with my o2 app which was not responding when I arrived one of the staff approached me and asked me if he could help this person was covered in heavy tattoos and into body building so I explained the situation to him but the problem was he wasn't looking at me when I told him he was looking straight forward watching who was passing by the store shop I said its obviously your not interested he then said I'm asking you to leave the shop I'm not going any further with you and walked away and called for security this was for no reason,2
"The staff at Wolverhampton branch are exceptional,  fantastic service second to none, really helpful especially Morris and also Dan.",2
"Absolutely diabolical, can't wait till my contract ends, I've been trying to pay my bill through customer service over the phone for over a week, at least 6/7 times, all I'm getting is we can't get your details up as we are upgrading our migration platform, what,😳, and I've now received 2 messages saying my bill is over due and they'll be switching my phone off, I cancelled my dd because for 4 months they'd charged me £18 over my bill for a premium number that I've never used or know, who it is, its nowhere on my phone,😡😡😡",2
"Brilliant network and got a great sim only Deal,thumbs up 👍",2
called to cancel my sim only.all done in 4.5 minutes. very good. Will go back to them when i start a new sim up,2
Hi it was the first time I had to ring 02 this morning since them merging with virgin media within 2 rings I started speaking to a guy named Joel to do with the fact my old contract ran out I was so highly stressed about the situation and the phone call lasted some time Joel was very kind patient and understanding as I didn't know what to do on my phone to sort things out being an older lady so he helped me through each step in a very clear way and managed to get there in the end I give credit where it's due and thanked him profusely for his help I hope that 02 really appreciate and value people like Joel who are a credit to their company sincere heartfelt thanks again I really couldn't have done it without you,2

Gavin from customer services was really helpful with ending my contract.,2
"Today I had a phone call from a customer service number, usually I hang up these calls but I answered to find out who was calling me, it was O2, if it was something that I knew was a spam call I would have hung up, for instance a company I do not spend money with, I asked how do I know if this is a legit call and the person I spoke to, Nickyle or Nick reassured me by telling me a few personal account details I would only know, I was happy that I was speaking to the O2 firm, upon calling me up he helped me with a few queries and honestly went above and beyond, we ended the call as he was trying to find out information on stock and there was no more to be done but after an hour or so he called me back to tell me what the news was, what a good guy, knows exactly how to talk to people, being kind and polite, I hope when I upgrade again Ill speak to this guy again. Top man, 10/10, it might not sound like much but this guy went through lengthy efforts to help me understand and better myself off, I really cant appraise him enough. Cheers Nickyle.",2
"I uploaded a scam app by mistake and after 2 days of trying to delete this app unsuccessfully,  I decided to go to O2 in Stafford where I was introduced to Stacey who was so professional and understanding and persevered for 30 minutes of frustration to remove this app she refused to be beaten by this app and after alot of humming and tutting Stacey finally completed the removal of this app, I would like to thank Stacey once again for her determination and patience in completing this task, Stacey is a credit to O2 and a great asset to the Stafford Branch, thank you Stacey 10/10 .",2

Bought a new phone and Smart watch. Needed a remote connection between my phone and watch. Called in Rhyl O2 shop and spoke to Will. He spent a considerable amount of time trying to set the connection up but to no avail. Tried again on another day with Amy but no joy. Called  today and spoke to Will. He tried again and discovered an obscure problem that was preventing the connection. Issue solved! Can now use my watch remotely to make and receive calls and texts remotely without my phone being nearby using my phone contract allowance. Both Will and Amy have been incredibly professional and patient the whole time. My thanks go out to them and I would be happy to recommend Rhyl O2 shop without reserve.,2
"I find 02 very helpful. I have a sim only contract which is good value, and my wife and children all have sim only and O2 give them a 20% family discount. So all of us with 02 and we save money each month. Additionally I find 02s customer support friendly and supportive. 02 recently discounted my bill when travelling overseas as a goodwill gesture which I was impressed with (I had strayed to a nearby antenna from a neighbouring country and so was charged international data roaming), plus they discounted my wife's bill once as a goodwill gesture when we accidentally didn't buy the overseas travel bolt on for a few hours which lead to high data roaming charges for a few hours.",2
"Went into 02 in Harrow town centre where i was served by Eshan. Just want to say that despite Eshan being extremeley busy, and me not getting anywhere with customer services Eshan went above and beyond to ensure that before i left i had my old number reconnected and that my other queries where dealt with. Outstanding customer services. I actually thought that Eshan was a manager and believe that should anyone deserve to be promoted Eshan definatley should be",2
I had an issue with my security and i spoke to tarun and he helped me with the issues,2
"I called 02 about issue that I had with my sim I spoke to Andie she was super helpful in getting my query sorted. Truly appreciate her for helping out. Many thanks, 02 I hope you recognise your best employees efforts.",2
"Adam from re-contracting (also known as upgrades) was fantastic. I called ready to switch back to pay as you go, as my contract was ending and I didn’t like the idea of being tied into a long contract. He was able to find me a 12 month contract which met my data usage needs and was a good deal. He explained everything clearly and professionally. I’d highly recommend him and o2! Thanks Adam!",2
May I ask you to pass on my thanks to a young man called Royston.  He was of great help to me.  He was effective and efficient. And very patient.  Got me sorted out very quickly.  I'm forever grateful to that young man.  He's a credit to your company.   Well done!!!!  From Phyllis O'Hara,2
"Excellent customer service from the Manager in the o2 shop North Street, Chichester, West Sussex. I am a pensioner and I struggle with phone tech stuff. My daughter took me to the shop in Chichester and the Manager there was just brilliant. He was so patient and explained everything in order to help me transfer my sim data from my very old phone to a newer iPhone. I was not rushed and I felt really good when I left the shop. Great Customer Service, thank you.",2
Hi I’m badr I would like to say this is my first time for hole 3 years as a customer i spoke with someone professional and patience great customer service jaydin is ace for his company so please make sure you have people like him working on the company thank you jaydin :),2
I've been with o2 for the best part of 13 years and I've never had an issue so far. Always get good offers and the prices are very fair in my opinion.,2
"I went with my husband to the O2 store at Eagles Meadow in Wrexham today for him to purchase a new phone. We were served by a young lady called Emily. We both agree that Emily is a credit to your company, she was helpful, knowledgeable and very engaging and a delight to speak too",2
Joined O2 around 10 days ago - in their Wakefield Branch.The staff were fantastic and not too pushy sales wise.Pricing was fair and great perks to go with.,2

"Brilliant team to deal with very professional and knowledgeable, after nightmare experience with another provider it was like a breath of fresh air and only wish had changed sooner.",2
Recently tried EE  made sense to have the service as already a  BT internet customer who are partnered with EE.Cancelled contract with  02 however EE have left me without a service.Returned to 02  new contract sorted within 40 minutes and thanks to the gentleman called HAFEZ  very friendly and proffessional who navigated his way around the  mess caused by EE to ensure  I  had service.   I've lost my number of over 20 years due to EE  but working on recovery  needed for my customers and my cardiologist .  Thanks 02  and HAFEZ . Looking forward to recieving my new phone,2
"I was considering of posting a bad review.I have been a customer of O2 for more than 5 years now and paying them every month around £150 for my three contracts.I also pay for device insurance and although I went through three different contracts with them I never claimed for a damaged phone. Until today. Today, I called them to file for a claim for my water damaged phone, which flickered and shut down after being caught in a rain while cycling. There is condensation behind the cameras. The phone is paperweight now.They are going to charge me £90 excess fee which corresponds to the 24 hours device replacement service, however, I will be on a waiting list until they will get that phone back in stock, that if they will ever get it back in stock. In fact, O2 and I are both apparently running on hope on this matter. So when I told the customer service that I need a phone for work the guys just said: ""sorry, cant help you with that. Anything else?"" Now, I am going to shop for a second hand device to use.Maybe it's just me. Maybe I did not read the o2 insurance fine print? Who knows?. I am sure that O2 would not have let their customers down and be dismissive just like that. Maybe it's my fault for expecting too much out of this phone service provider, and my fault for not choosing Apple Care instead.O2 is a great company. Sadly, I am not such a great customer. All I did so far was to pay my contract in time and expecting for services to just work.",2
"The o2 at Ealing Broadway , Carlean is the best pearson to deal with any issue you have with your 02 account , she is knowledgeable, friendly and you really come out very happy with the service.I actually come all the way from Birmingham to see her .",2
"I had an issue with 2FA after I ported a number over to O2 not realising I'd used my O2 number for authentication and now couldn't access an account. It seemed a complex issue to resolve but the technical help from O2 was brilliant, and solved this problem quite quickly. I can't believe the poor reviews here, as I've had nothing but great service from O2, and they always seem to have the best contracts when I am looking to renew.",2
"Visited O2 store in Liverpool.Customer advisor Ellie could not have been more helpful,she is a credit to O2,pity a few more couldn't follow her example.First class employee",2
Virgin recently switched me to 02. I saw cheaper 02 deals than mine on comparison sites but they did not show on the 02 app. I rang 202 and their helpful agent changed me to a £5 twelve monthly deal with 10GB data and unlimited calls/texts.,2
"Following a major accident with my mobile phone, I found myself having to buy a new one. Although I'd bought it in another shop I found the customer service in O2, Clacton on Sea exceptional. Lewis and his colleagues went over and above to get the new phone working for me. They gave advice and were really helpful. Thank you",2
"Well Ive had the exact opposite experience from 02 Customer services, they couldn't have been more helpful. After security questions established I was helped by an extremely polite,professional individual.My issue was resolved and I was made aware of issues that will assist me greatly in the future. Hasn't been a smooth transition from Virgin mobile to 02, but 02 customer services couldnt have impressed me anymore. Thanks 02",2
"Called in the 02 shop in Wakefield today,I have a sim only contract.Asked if they could transfer data from my old phone to new one.The young lady who I think was in charge was lovely,and while there I noticed how well she treated her fellow assistants,she is a credit to your company.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years and have several contracts with them. They have always helped me find the best deals helping me save money on many occasions! - But this review is for Jiten, who has just given me the best service i have ever received from O2. He was professional, with amazing products knowledge but equally patient with me whilst i was being incredibly indecisive! Thank you for your time and service Jiten.(Sales department)",2
"Climbed the O2 this morning 11 am with my friend both celebrating our 60th birthdays. Our guide was Dan. The whole experience from beginning to end was wonderful,Dan was helpful from start to finish, Highly recommended. Thank you Lucia",2
"Very easy to deal with and seamless transfer from Three (Who are rubbish, see reviews) to O2. Ordered online, sim arrived as planned the next working day, filled in the transfer of number form, all transferred the next day. Great coverage, couldn't be better. Thanks O2.",2
"Had a problem with transfer from virgin to O2. On line help was very poor and misleadingWe went to the O2 shop in Kingsgate Huddersfield. A young kady called Charlotte  Middleton listened carefully and patiently to our problems and dealt with my phone first. We had to pick up our grandchild so she invited us back the following morning where she successfully fixed our other mobile.What an assett to your company. Knowledgeable,  patient and kind. Thankyou so much Charlotte",2
"I have found O2 to be a good mobile phone company, and the call centre staff are patient and helpful.I am abroad in the EU, but I forgot to set one of my phones for roaming (ending in -2973). I spoke to Zethu (on 04-07) and Selwyn (06-07) in S. Africa, and they were very patient and helpful. Selwyn resolved by problem, and I was up and running. Many thanks.My only complaint is that some of the S. African speakers MUST speak more slowly and clearly.",2
"A lady called Afsana was extremely patient , informative , kind and got the job done . Afsana rang me back when she said and I really could not ask for a better person to help me with setting up my consumer account and advising me on switching my business account . Thank you . I will stay with o2 for probably another twenty years happily .",2
"The interaction that I had with Kutala from O2 was outstanding! She is definitely a member of staff who knows her stuff, and delivers the help clearly and in a way that is easy to understand. Good luck to her and thank you! 👍",2
"Had a lot of questions about a contract and I spoke with Sharon lene on the phone who was very helpful and patient in explaining everything . Thank you for making an excellent customer service staff. Yes, the wait to speak to an agent is long but once they get through, they have always been helpful. I hope to always speak with kind and patient staff.",2
"Just had a phone call 10 mins before they shut with Hassan and honestly, brilliant customer service. He was fast, efficient And straight to the point. So so helpful, couldn’t thank him enough",2
"Good afternoonRecently I had an issue regarding payment of one of my accounts (mainly of a personal reason) that I hold with O2 …Well after speaking to the first advisor whom I found to be rude and not at all understanding or even cared!Shortly after I then realised that as a service company that I have dealt with for over 10 years without a break deserved another call, which i then proceeded to make as that person was not the O2 of old (I hoped) and have to say the customer service personnel (2nd call 26/06/2023) I spoke to was way above outstanding and a huge credit to the company and I’m so glad I made that decision ..Well I thought I should at least make the effort in writing to acknowledge that representatives’ good work plus genuine compassion and to convey my thanks.Fantastic customer service!O2 customer",2
I’ve been with o2 for long time never a problem  and as long as they do EU roaming I’ll stick with them,2
Saw a cheap deal online. Plusnet is closing so I thought good time to port my number across. Bought online. Sim arrived next day and number ported across two days later. Data speeds where I am are acceptable 5-20 mbps. Good attention to detail- on the O2 app my temporary number appeared but was replaced by my 'real' number after the porting finished.,2
I would like to point out I had the best support I could ask for from Connor in the Livingston West Lothian O2 shop. He went out of his way to sort out my problem with an app on my phone. Excellent customer service.,2
"O2 on my last contact was brilliant, Craig went out of his way to sort out my new Sim only plan and to ensure the online discount applied to ordering AirTags, he kept me up to date, managed expectations and called back as promised. He is a great asset for O2.",2
"Paul in retentions upgraded my sim only contract to unlimited everything deal. Excellent service from Paul. I agree that the network service can be improved and hopefully improve the coverage, especially with the possible merger between Vodafone and Three on the horizon.",2
"A great experience in Northampton store.2 Young lads Seb & sorry didn’t catch the others name helped us to sort out some issues we were unable to resolve ourselves, being techno dinosaurs! There were no sales, new contracts etc in it for them but their willingness to help and understand has ensured continued loyal business as I have been with O2 for over 25 years now.They are both a credit to the business.",2
"Spoke to Granbel on the phone for some help with my data on Monday. He couldn’t have been more helpful and patient, offering me solutions and recommendations for other relevant offers.

"I phoned today to upgrade my mobile and spoke to Shervan who was just outstanding and so helpful and polite what a credit to O2 he is, he listened to everything I wanted and got me a amazing deal and explained everyone step by step",2
The only network with full coverage where I live and where I work. Have been great to deal with and I've had really good deals off them as has my wife. Great offers included with Priority too. No issues and happy to continue with them as long as they continue providing the same in future.,2
Phoned up numerous times with little joy from agents. However on my 4th time got this very helpful gentleman.Credit to 02.,2
Excellent service from Nayam when I enquired about changing my tariff. Everything was explained. A credit to your company,2
So got my upgrade phone but none of the other adaptor etc in the order I thought would come together Phoned Shannon a lovely lady at O2 who put it right so very quicklyThree cheers for her She was polite kind considerate and professionalI believe in compliments where they are due There are far too many complaintsGiving a compliment gives incentive as it must be very demoralising if you are following your companies script and the customer is not happy Trying to get the balance right can be hard at times I’m sureI hope Shannon is recognised by her bosses We need more customer friendly people like her Thanks 🧡,2
"Meherzad provided excellent customer service and resolved my issue quickly with a polite, friendly manner.",2
Time to upgrade dayso rang O2 Retention Dept I hope if you have done the same you have got to talk to JayThis guy is definitely a dedicated team player who enjoys going to work His manner was friendly pleasant and polite He listened and instead of urging me to buy a plan that didn’t fit for a quick sale he found me the perfect phone at a fantastic price and ticked all the boxes tailored for me  He didn’t rush me one bitI’m always apprehensive at Upgrade time but Jay made sure I was happy He certainly knows the products I understood and asked me if I had any questions more than once I gained confidence and trusted his choice He is a rarity in any customer service these days He told me that customers are considered to be the backbone of a company What a fantastic attitude only a pity others don’t think the same way For once in a long time I wasn’t made to feel like an old aged pensioner nuisance and that takes a skill and respect I would recommend him any day He would make a good Training OfficerDefinitely an asset for O2 and should be recognised as such He should go far up the ladder Any company would be lucky to have him✈️ Thankyou Jay You are really appreciated You’re a credit firstly to yourself ✈️,2
"Had a bit of an issue with my phone and had difficulty explaining the situation over the phone as was quite tricky, i decided to go into the foyleside store where a young worker called Tom went above and beyond. Absolutely outstanding customer service.",2
I was on the phone to Alan Reeder from O2. My query was solved promptly and I learned new things about my data and tricks to sustain it. The man has amazing and rich knowledge. He deserves acknowledgment.,2
"I spoke with Sabrina today in 02 customer service and she was extremely helpful. After being hung up on numerous times, she was very informative and helped me resolve my issue. Thank you so much",2
"People only ever leave reviews when they’ve had a bad experience, but I just had a call with O2 which was a really nice experience, and I’d like to think that the person I spoke to will get some kind of recognition.I called 202 today and spoke to a man named Daryl about a PAC code. He was lovely, polite, very friendly and we were having a really nice chat in between all the actual work he had to do for me. I’m a very anxious person when it comes to ringing companies and speaking over the phone, but Daryl put me right at ease by simply talking and joking with me like a human being. I imagine his job sends a lot of angry people his way on a daily basis, so here is a bit of positivity, even if this review never reaches him.",2
l had ordered Samsung tablet from 02 app l had a faulty  tablet they said they would give me a replacement they were good very good service on the phone they said they would send it to the 02 shop,2
"After having purchased a new Apple Watch, I decided to use O2 as I have used them for numerous years. As usual, I was offered excellent service by the staff in the Northallerton branch, given exactly what I needed and given the service I expected. Having been an O2 customer for 20 years, everything was as expected.",2
"Top Top Top, Absolutely best phone shop ever, always helpful and best service, friendly staff. defiantly recommended. big thanks to Steve, Lewis, Amanda, Alisha and Fran for best service.",2
"I feel sad about some of the reviews I've seen on Trustpilot,as my experience with O2 has been nothing but positive.Whilst there are more competitive companies,I know where I stand with O2 and so far,touch wood,have not had any problems with the reception.I also had to contact customer service today,wasn't kept waiting for ages and spoke someone called Noxolo.Great customer service ,didn't feel rushed,extremely helpful and felt more reassured at the end of the call,thanks again Noxolo.I'm happy to pay what I am paying at the moment because I get what I pay for ,hence five stars.",2
"Can't believe these reviews are for same company that I've used on & off for many years. I had two lines but called to cancel one of them tonight. Jake was brilliant lovely guy, all sorted in no time.I've never once had any issues with O2 customer services and I've had experience of all the big companies. Plenty of bad issues with the others. I guess people are quicker to complain than praise.Keep up the good work guys, there are customers that appreciate you 😊",2
I would like to review  about  a girl Jyothi whom I just spoken now. Excellent care services over the phone supported me and solved my request. Great communication skills and  comforting words and consoling attitudes. Being tactile and been practical  solved mygenuine needs quickly. I wish her all the best and good luck for her life and carrier. Thank you Mary Paul. 🤩🤍🩷💕,2
I have just received my like new iPhone 14 pro max and have to say it’s stunning there isn’t a mark on it after reading reviews I was concerned about getting a phone with used marks over it and I was nearly put off by this but I took a chance.Phew so glad I went for like new phone would recommend from my experience,2
Since brexit they are the only one of the big networks to allow you to use your minutes in europe without ridiculous roaming fees.,2
Customer Service was very good. Mr. Shubhankar from India is a very helpful and nice person who was able to solve all the issues regarding O2 service. He has done very fantastic job and really satisfied and appreciated the help.,2
"Ash was a great customer service agent, looked for best deal when upgrading and explained contract well",2
I would like to thank Tom for his exceptional customer service and knowledge of his products.(Tom who sold me a phone as I believe there are two)All staff are very good in Haywards Heath store,2
"Switched to o2 via a comparison website for a cheaper sim deal.I had been with 3 for many years but in the last few, have had issues with network reception and calls cutting out, a new handset made no difference so it was time to move on.Switch over and transfer of my number was very easy to do, the only niggle I do have is, send a text or email with the date the change will take place, it was only on the off chance that I noticed emergency calls only and realised my old sim had been deactivated.Other than that, so far so good, no complaints with network reception at all and happy with my cheap deal.If anything changes, I will of course update my rating!",2
"Haleemah E - Customer Services:I recently moved over to O2 and Haleemah has been amazing helping me solve my queries she had answers to all my questions there was no hesitation or uncertainty from Haleemah, she gave me different solutions and the best advice! Honestly had been the best customer service I have experienced to date so thankful I got through to Haleemah I have never left a review but I was adamant to leave Haleemah a nice review just for appreciation as no one else was at all helpful or have a friendly attitude and they were not able to help just kept transferring me. Thank you Haleemah for your help this week!",2
"My a22 Samsung was constantly cutting me off. Went to upgrade to a23. Told to do it by phone because O2 shop couldn't access them due to imminent arrival of a24. Thought I had sorted it after 30 min call, assured they were in stock, chose colour and delivery date.  30 mins later email said out of stock despite offer still being shown as available on website. Immediately rang 02 to raise the issue with them [Sunday 19th March] Spoke to Gerry (Jerry) who took the time and patience to arrange an alternative phone having confirmed a23 was out of stock. He arranged for me to cancel the a23 order and stated he would ring me today [21/3/23] between 12 noon and 12.30pm. He rang me during that time slot as promised and sorted everything out to my complete satisfaction as well as supplying me with another tablet. Both products at a very reasonable price. Gerry in effect recovered the situation extremely well after the initial disappointment. Again he was polite, courteous, and took the time to explain everything in full, going the extra mile. He deserves recognition for this in turning what was going to a complaint into a positive outcome. Thank you.",2
"I have recently purchased a contract with o2, and had weeks worths of issues trying to port my old number across. During this time I have made multiple phone calls to the company but not been given a solution. Today, I called once again trying to resolve this issue and was attended by a very helpful, polite man named Muhammad. He was very understanding of the issue and tried to get it resolved as soon as possible. He explained thoroughly where the issue was coming from, and how it is going to be sorted. He is the only person to help with this issue and I am very pleased with the service.",2
"I came here 4 weeks ago to write a 1 star review as I thought my problem would never be resolved.I saw the volume of 1 star reviews and thought what's the point?I complained on an internal o2 survey and was booked in for a call.I completed the call with Chris this morning.I was listened to, I was understood and a solution was delivered that was more than acceptable. I just wanted my phone fixed. Now I am getting the broken one swapped out the next working day which brings 6 months of problems (with the manufacturer) to an end, thanks to O2.I am amazed. Relieved. Happy. Then remembered the volume of 1 star reviews and thought after the resolution they deserved some praise.Well done o2 for doing what you said you would do.",2
"So far so good. I was panicking after ordering & only then reading the reviews. But it's been better than expecting with 5g coverage, superb download & upload speeds. Well cheaper than rivals & still only 24month contracts.",2
Went to newtownards  store  and csa Adam could not do enough to solve my lost phone issue this chap is an absolute credit to 02 as he was quick  and nothing was to much hassle to him,2
We visited the Skipton store on 11th February to collect 2 new Samsung A23 phones We had excellent service from Adam and Omar .We walked out with 2 fully functional phones They were patient polite and professional  Many many thanks,2
"Every time I visit O2 in Macclesfield they are kind,  calm and incredibly helpful. I can't recommend this branch highly enough. Please don't close!",2
"Its regarding my mobile sim card charged wrongfully long time even after changing the Direct Debit. it was being charged in my current account plus my old cancelled account, both.O2 Retail store - Eastbourne - Alex. he assisted me  to understand my case and guided me towards right direction.Complaint Review Service Department - O2 - Ms Lauren MitchellLauren has been very helpful to understand the case and to resolve the matter. I managed to get refund .Thank You!",2
The 02 in Kettering was a brilliant service when l ordered my Samsung galaxy watch 5 the assistant was very nice better than Wellingborough was a better service more welcoming,2
"Really happy with the customer service team at O2. I needed help with understanding the process of switching from an alternative provider to O2. A customer service team member, Frasel (apologies, I may have misspelt his name) went through the information very clearly with me today. He was helpful, personable and ensured I understood the terms and conditions of the contract. I know exactly what to expect of the contract and O2 have made a bright first impression to me now. Thank you!",2
"Together with my husband I visited 02 Mansfield, Four Seasons shopping Centre, 15/02/2023 not thinking that we would get our problem with 2 mobiles we had resolved. Therefore, we are delighted to report that Michalis, the 02 representative we met, was so patient and knowledgeable about the product, and it was sorted within 5 minutes, and deserving of this tribute.",2
"The only reason why i'm giving 02 a five star rating is because of one off their customer service advisors called Sean. I also experienced problems with my bill. They took payment from me 3 times for the same bill. When i first call up about the situation no one was taking me seriously until one day i call and was connected to an advisor call Sean. Sean was so helpful and helped me to get my money back and resolved the missing bill payment. I have read the other reviews and i'm not shocked, but there is good advisors working for 02 if your lucky enough to get through too one when you call up. Thanks once again Sean.",2
Rang O2 today to discuss my Account.  I spoke with James who was very helpful and answered my questions professionally and I was very impressed - James receives ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ well done James,2
"Easy, relatively quick number import from Three (good riddance). Efficient, and friendly customer service.New phone arrived as expected, nice, quick turnaround.Price hikes are happening across all networks btw, O2 are not going out on their own.",2
Just spoken to Hasan from sales who assisted me in saving me over £40 a month and gaining over 100gb of data by moving me to a Sim only and keeping my phone insurance! I have been with o2 for over 9 years and continue to be a happy customer 😃,2
"I had issues with calls on my phone being barred. I went to 02 in the Trafford Centre, Manchester and the lady assistant and an assistant called MAC went out if their way to help me which was greatly appreciated. I would certainly recommend these 2 people as I couldn't have asked for more. Excellent service",2
"Louise Garnett gets 5 stars from me ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I have been with O2 for years and yearsUnfortunately myself and my mother in law had a billing issue that became complex and despite several calls and emails it wasn’t resolved until todayLouise text me in advance to say she would call to resolve my issue, which she didShe was the most helpful, friendly understanding person I have spoken to in ages and an example of what outstanding customer service isThank you so much, you are an absolute credit and asset to O2!",2
"Andrea Hayes, she was nice and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone and thank you for nice and excellent service.",2

"My daughter experienced a robbery when she came back from school a bikeman snatched her phone. When we told O2 the customer service woman named ""Princess"" was very good at handling the situation and explained all prodecures carefully and calmly and kept us feeling at ease. This has really impressed me and made me feel confident in the O2 company. I am really blown away by Princess's service and hope that there would be many more like her.",2
Very happy with Kyle at the Mansfield O2 store.  I have been experiencing problems with SMSC texts.  His advise was very profesional and turned out to be spot on.,2
"I went to the Kidderminster store on Sunday, with my partner. His phone was completely damaged and he hadn’t long taken out the contract, with no insurance. The 3 staff there were super friendly and could see we were stressed, as the phone was needed for work the next day. Bradley was brilliant! He solved all our issues and we ended up with a new phone and cash back. I’ve never seen staff love their jobs more, they were so hyped about O2 benefits, it really made our worry disappear. Such a lovely environment, I’ve never experienced this before. What a brilliant team! Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2
"As an existing customer, I was exploring options for using my phone in Canada. The two colleagues I spoke with could not have been more helpful - they both listened, understood and suggested various solutions. They were extremely patient and clear with their information and everything subsequently happened as they said it would. Thank you.",2
I have just changed from bt mobile to o2 mobile. I had an issue spoke to o2 online chat with Salman received a very professional & efficient service.,2
"i brought a sim only plan a week later i saw a better sim only deal (£5 month cheaper - still with O2) so as i was in my 14 day cooling off period i called to cancel it, with the intention of taking out the cheaper one - the lady i spoke to on the phone asked why i wanted to cancel - so i explained id seen a better O2 deal online - she said you dont need to cancel, ill just change your tariff - which she did there and then.. no quibble - even got credit on my bill as paid £5 extra for the original tariff - whats not to like?my number port happened on the day they said it would - with out issue.thanks",2
Cheryl from payment management absolute gem she’s handled my concerns with ease and help me been absolute amazing thank you Cheryl 5stars!!!,2
"Quick to get through to customer services, super friendly support with one person able to cover multiple areas (billing, technical). Courteous, professional service and multiple issues competently resolved. Impressed.",2
Had a great experience on the phone with customer service today Marischa O'Connell was very helpful,2
"It was because of O2’s swift action to secure my account and the agent’s patience, kindness and understanding that prevented me from becoming a victim of the 40% off or new mobile phone offer scam",2
"Hereford shop to buy a new phone. The salesperson, Robert, was absolutely amazing. He could not have been more helpful and polite. We will have no reservation in going there again. This guy is an absolute asset to the business. Thanks.",2
I was in store and was doing switch upConnor from the Ballymena store took time and helped me the best he can and listened to me blabbering. He advised about the Samsung 20 days of Christmas I just praise everything he has done to help me.,2
I visited o2 branch in Fulham Broadway and was served by 2 members of staffJoyce and Amanda both of who were extremely knowledgable and helpful - excellent customer care!,2
"Superb network, no issue at all always been the best  ￼",2
"Moved to a £8/month SIM-Only deal during the Black Friday sales. I was pleasantly surprised to see my 30gb unlimited text and calls deal doubled because I'm also a Virgin Media customer. £8 for 60GB data and I can roam for free, what a cracking deal. The port over from my O2 business SIM could have been better but we'll worth the money.",2
"UPDATE: Awesome service. Take it to the CEO. Our issue was dealt with very promptly by the CEO. We received a credit for the bad service, and they unlocked our phone free.EXISTING COMPLAINT: Wowsers. Lazy incompetent staff. Entered one of the o2 branches and not joking you, there were 4 or 5 members all sitting down. NONE of them got up to greet me and my husband. Apparently, my husband's number is not in the system, yet they are taking £20 per month from my husband's account. Such unhelpful people. Couldn't care less whether my husband has been a loyal member of o2 for over a decade and just told us to do everything online at o2.",2
All the people in the Northampton store were so helpful today. They went above and beyond to help when I had a slight emergency with my phone.Very impressed.,2
"I had issues regarding my network connection, unable to call, text or use my data.With the help of Angel from on the O2 live chat he was able to answer my questions and help me out pretty swiftly.Turned out to be not O2’s fault.Wrote this review to thank Angel really, because the solution disconnected the live chat.Appreciate your help lad.",2
"O2 please give your good man Will in sales a pay rise, he is an exceptional attribute to your company and because of him I’d tell everyone I know to join o2 he’s completely made my year maybe you should give him a paid month of for Christmas for his good work he deserves it !!",2
Thank you Rueben for sorting that out for me! 02 had taken too much money and the salesperson did not know anything and could not resolve it I was frustrated! After talking to Rueben he resolved it all in 4 mins and I was credited £50 to my account just like that big up to this man he is customer focused and polite and listens to customers frustration thank you again Rueben your the man,2
Always decent renewal offers on. Good customer service via phone too.,2
"Excellent so far, moved three contracts from Vodafone to O2 and couldn't be happier.",2
"All my PAYG credit had disappeared and the top up card machine at my local garage kept saying ""Invalid Product Config"" whatever that means.  Got through to Customer Service within three minutes (!) and the chap I spoke to was loud and clear.  He quickly identified the problem as the settings on my new phone, he rang me back on my landline and talked me through resetting my new phone.  He then spoke to his manager and restored most of my lost phone credit. Brilliant, if only all customer service was like this.  Thank you M.....",2
"All good so far. Reception has improved over the years as ten years ago I couldn’t get any signal at my house, now get 2 or 3 bars. Got good deal for new phone, 30gb and unlimited texts and calls for £23. Signed up to airtime rewards using code E977QRRT and nearly up to £10 off this months bill",2
"I’ve been with 02 UK for years and I cant fault them. They send me an email every month with my bill total which usually doesn’t vary much unless I make some calls when I’m on holiday in the US or wherever. No fuss, amount taken by Direct Debit and no unwanted junk mail by email or post.  A very happy customer.",2
"excellent customer service, benefits/rewards and phone coverage. I have been with o2 since I was 13 as a child on a family plan and now 6 years on my own account every year they seem to get better and offer more. I recently changed contract and thought I should leave a review as customer service in the UK is disgusting at the moment but o2 seems to have got it right!as someone that travels a lot out of the Eu, they are excellent and have always been reasonable.",2
"I had run out of data and telephoned O2 for advice and help.  I was dealt with in a very professional manner, asking about my O2 preferences and informing me of certain contractual arrangements.  I spoke to three customer advisors, but only have the name of the first, who was David.  He said that, after thoroughly explaining various aspects of the contract, that he would send a new SIM out to me.  He was patients and professional - thank you.All those who helped me were very good - Ta!",2
Although having being lied to and the phone put down on me I wanted to give some feedback to Saira in the South African office. Honestly she was a pleasure to deal with. She listened to my problem and sorted it within a few minutes. Her can do attitude and efficiency in dealing with my prolem should be commended. Please pass my thanx to her and make sure her managers are aware. She has restored my faith with O2.,2
This 5 star review is for the Customer Service Agent called Temoor.  He was bloomin fantastic. He went above and beyond to help me with my upgrade as I had been on the phone for over half an hour being fobbed off by 3/4 other customer service people.  He is a credit to your company and you should give him the reward he deserves. Thank you Temoor. You Sir are a legend.,2
"I popped in the Poole store today and spoke with Jake, unfortunately for Jake he had me as the customer, I am not tech savvy one bit. He was the most helpful and patient advisor that i have come across in retail for years. He was still friendly and smiling on my 4th visit of the day, and still very happy to answer my queries and questions. He is a credit to O2, keep hold of him!",2
"Davino thank you , for giving me extra data when I really needed it.and thank you to Armenia for her help this morning. I have been with 02 for years and have only ever had polite efficient customer service assistants.  Thank you very much.",2
"I do believe I've written a previous review of my experience with o2 Mobile.  It was a favourable review and related to my use of the o2 Pay As you Go service.I recently requested an upgrade from PAYG to a Pay monthly 'SIM only' service with of a 4gb monthly allowance and unlimited calls and texts. This is costing me £6 a month.Again I have to report that the transition was completely free of any sort of hiccup or glitch. Everything went smoothly and efficiently and the three call centre advisors ( Sana and Channel and Vanessa) to whom I spoke when setting up the new account were absolutely fine - one was operating from the UK call centre and the other two were in the South Africa call centre and the call quality was fine.  All were helpful and well informed and, where appropriate, kept their promises regarding calling me back etc.I honestly have no complaints at all. However the vast majority of reviewers here have other thoughts on the matter and I must conclude that it's time o2 did something to address this dreadful situation where so very many people are NOT satisfied.",2
"Seen so many negative reviews of O2, so wanted to at least offer some light from my own personal experience. I can't speak for the various stores across the country, but the Mansfield O2 store have always been occupied by friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. I know that 5G network is still a work in progress for areas like mine, but do find that I've linked up to a 5G signal quite regularly so can enjoy their speeds. When I moved to my previous house, I was with EE, where I had pretty bad signal, so eventually got to change over to O2 whose signal was spot on. Where I live now is abit of a black spot for other networks at times, but O2 signal is so reliable for me and apart from the odd maintenance work on the local mast, had no issues with connectivity. Every issue I have had, which is extremely infrequent to be honest has been resolved so quickly. I was recently overcharged on my bill due to my phone linking to a Turkish network whilst in Greece (also one of the only networks that still offer free EU roaming), they admitted that there was an error and was quick to resolve the issue and refund me the amount I had been overcharged. I genuinely can't say enough good words about their service.",2
I had a big issue yesterday as i was moving over to O2 and all my children as well. My old provider didn’t allow the number to move easily on time then i had to travel to Chester with my old SIM which stopped went to Chester O2 shop Jack was absolutely brilliant he helped me even though his boss was reluctant to help meThen i had an issue as mistakenly the Sim Jack gave me was registered for my daughter’s number who is on her own at uni and suddenly didn’t have any service I rang customer services and that was best experience ever LORITA from customer service went above and beyond to sort out my problem got my daughter’s mobile working again and mine working with my number she promised to ring me when i get all details needed and she did contact me not only once but several times if all O2 customer services are of that level like Lorita this company should be rated the best please thank her on my behalf,2
Wouldn’t want to be on any other network. I have had contracts with o2 since 2015 and the customer experience has always been better than any other for me. In 2020 i switched to vodafone as they offered a cheap contract on a phone. But i always had too many problems with them. As soon as i switched back I haven’t had any problems free eu roaming is a massive plus. 4g coverage is perfect for where i am. 5g isn’t really available but i can forgive that considering the speeds i get on 4g. Customer service are always helpful and 9 times out of 10 i will have my problem solved within 1 call. The customer services team are helpful and polite. All in all just a positive customer experience,2
"Just wanted to say a big thank you to Elizabeth from Yorkshire! When opting to leave o2 I had tried so many times to leave but it kept getting pro longed and always cut off. However Elizabeth walked me through all my options is a great manor and ended my time with o2 with a smile as she was so wonderful, polite and helped so much. So thank you Elizabeth company’s need more of you!",2
Visited your Westwood Cross shop to buy my father in law a phone. This is his first foray into the internet and smart phone. Which isn’t an easy thing to do as an 83 year old. The service he received was excellent with the assistant explaining the difference between monthly and pay as you go. He suggested the oppo A16 as a good ‘first time’ smart phone which was what he opted for in the end. He explained everything to my father-in-law in layman’s terms that he could understand. He chose the phone  they had recommended and left happy.,2
"My experience with the 02 store in Peterborough, Queensgate, was fantastic. Everyone presented themselves in a calm and friendly manner, and I felt welcome to ask any questions. The service I received was above and beyond, I am really grateful particularly to Shakk who went out of his way to provide me with the detailed information on the contract I wanted to upgrade to- but also in transferring data from my old phone. The Peterborough 02 team provided an excellent service for me and I'd recommend this company to all.",2
This 5 stars is only because of the help I received from Julia from customer service she has been very helpful and deserves a raise cannot thank her enough for the help give her a promotion or something lol,2
"After previous bad experiences with o2, I must say I have just had nothing short of an outstanding experience with callum with in the retentions team. If it was not for this man, I would not still be with o2. Although I was his last call of the day, not once was he rushing me, but he was extremely polite, very helpful and made me feel very well taken care of and heard, as well as seeming very knowledgeable and he took the time to answer any questions I had with no issue at all! For this, I must say, outstanding service.",2
"O2 and of course Virgin are one of the great companies that have kept free EU roaming! As long as you keep EU roaming going, I can see you potentially driving all these greedy networks like 3, Vodafone, EE, Voxi and Tesco (to date) out of business. How on earth they can expect to keep customers in the future is just beyond me. They're just taking advantage of Brexit as they aren't bound by EU law anymore. Nothing but cooperate greed!Keep it up o2! Providing you continue offering free EU roaming, all these other greedy networks are fast going to be losing customers and potentially go bust. Your gain is their loss!!!",2
"I was having problems with setting up my phone with the new sim, this was part of a new contract with Virgin Media and their ammended service. I was unable to get through to the 02 call centre so went to our local store at Teesside Park. I was helped there by Danielle. She was professional, helpful and friendly. My problem was resolved quickly and I was given help and further information to prevent further problem. I would use this store in future because of the help I received.",2
Great deal I had with them and so happy with ethic support team!,2
"Love o2!Used to love three mobile, but I moved to o2 and now I am in love. You can use your phone all over london no dropping of calls plus the battery my phone lasts twice as long dump three come to o2",2
"I've been with Sky mobile, Vodafone, EE, GiffGaff and Lebara - o2 has been by far, the best choice!Let me tell you why it's been a game changer for me.• I'm with Virgin so can take advantage of VOLT (double data and upgraded broadband for FREE)• Highly competitive if you explore uSwitch, I pay only £8 for 20GB data (which is now 40GB cause of VOLT on 2 sim only plans)• o2 priority app - FREE coffee, who doesn't like a free coffee from Greggs?• App is fairly well made in comparison to other competitors• Customer Service has been great, compared to experiences with all of the above providers• Signal is fantastic, not as good as EE but EE is way more expensive and you get less value for money• FREE data usage when travelling abroad in their Europe Zone (the only major provider that does NOT charge)This is why o2 are a fantastic providers to be with!",2
Not impressed at all with 02 and thank god I am with EE. Went to a shop today to support my elderly mother. The young man couldn't have been more unhelpful if he tried. My mother will now be leaving 02,2
"Professional customer service. I recently made the mistake to move from O2 because I got a better deal from someone else.It was only once I had to deal with the complete incompetence of this other provider that I realised how efficient O2's customer service team are.I have now returned and will not make the same mistake again. Thank you O2 customer service team. I think you are based in South Africa (based on the accent) and could not be more friendly, bright and helpful.",2
"I am not an 02 customer and had my details used to create an account. I did not notice till 3 months into service of the account.(Yeah I should keep an eye on my account but working nights on a covid ward kinda makes that mission.)But the service, understanding and being listened to was outstanding.The lady was fast efficient and made me feel she/the company were there for me even though I am not their customer.I was on the phone for less than 10-15 mins  the auto selection took longer to get through than my actual business.EE,Vodafone,3 take note this lady is the kinda service team you need to have.Santana R you are a credit to your company and the service.Thank you.Santana thank you 02.",2
"I have had the best customer service ever by a staff member named Jade at the upgrade/ retention department at 02She went above and beyond to ensure I upgraded at  price thats suitable for my needs. I cannot thank her enough!she was very patient, understanding and supportive.",2
Vikram from 02 has been so helpful regarding my phone. In some aspect I have been made a victim and he’s been helpful/patient with my particular case. It’s good to have someone of his level of understanding.,2
"I can see many reviews about issues but my experience with o2 has been very smooth and issue free thus far. I have had my number with them for over a decade and I have not had issues getting through to speak to anyone, always very helpful and very polite.",2
"Doncaster Frenchgate branch.Outstanding service today from James and Ross this morning, from entering the shop  to upgrade my phone.They're knowledge was second to none and gave us superb customer care.After being told by another mobile company that you have lost thousands of precious photos etc Ross retrieved everything and I'm just so grateful.Total credit to the company !  Thanks guys.",2
I wrote a review a couple of days ago about customer service I have recieved from o2 but today I spoke with a lady called Ruquiyah who listened to what I said & spoke to me with me with respect & resolved a problem I've tried to solve for over a year & half ( THANK YOU Ruquiyah ). They should give you a promotion thanks again for all your hard work. 😉😄😃,2
I have to say.my experience in the Hartlepool 02 shop was brilliant.Tim who dealt with us was so helpful and I must say he is a credit to 02.He gave us advice on the phones me and my husband wanted.also he sorted changing us from sky to virgin.thanks once again tim.definetly recommend him if anyone needing a new phone .his customer service is outstanding,2
"Sam in 02 recycle was both kind & understanding. He listened to my issue, looked into my case & promptly dealt with it correctly as I had done nothing to damage my handset in any way. It really helps when people like Sam work @ 02. Thank you so much.",2
"Just got off the phone to Customer Services regarding an issue I had with my Pay as You Go Sim. The call was answered very promptly and the issue was resolved by Marcelle there and then. Marcelle was very understanding, helpful and cheerful. I couldn't fault her service and if I every need to call back again I home I get through to her as she made the whole interaction very pleasant.",2
Hi there - I called 202 and I just wanted to commend your CSA Connor for great customer service. Many thanks & keep up the good work.👍,2
"There are lots of bad reviews of o2 on here, but I think that they are great by comparison, as I have just come from BT.",2
"I find O2 very good with their customer services and mobile offers, my signal yet as to hit a black spot which it has not, I’m able to make calls where some mobile companies cannot get signals.",2
Don’t know why everyone’s submitting bad reviews as I’ve had nothing but a positive experience with o2 the last 10 years. They offer great extras such as the Virgin Media Volt On (Double data and speed) and discount for employees of NHS and other companies through o2 OPEN. Would highly recommend to anyone. Just did o2 Refresh with Donna from customer service and received great service!,2
"Regardless of the many negative reviews, I have personally never had an issue with them. Phones arrive the following day if ordered before midnight and their CS team has always been helpful when I've needed them.It seems as long as you pay your bill you'll never have an issue.In an age fuelled by entitlement and expectations of compensation for the smallest of inconveniences i can't help but wonder if a lot of these negative reviews are warranted",2
I've been with O2 for many years. I don't understand all the negative reviews. Maybe I'm lucky but they've always been very helpful with me. Customer service is always excellent.,2
"Quick service, was shown how to use and what I needed. Great thank you.",2
I’ve today ordered a new line with o2… so far amazing. I’m fully aware on costings now and the future and look forward to a great experience at o2… where as at another provider.. remain nameless decide to bully threaten and totally destory customers mental health. I’m looking forward to Being with 02… and as soon as I can… move all my lines over from old provider to too,2
Lovely customer service don’t know why the bad reviews amazing experience,2
Excellent service from Mohammed on customer service assisting me on upgrading my phone and getting the best deal. Thank you for your time and effort Mohammed!,2
"My contract came to an end recently, after speaking on the phone with Sarah Witham from customer services she was really helpful and managed to get me a really good deal on a sim only contract. I am happy to be staying with O2 for another 12 months!",2
"Great company been with them 12 years now and renewing is easy, I have my mother and sons account with mine too. Reasonable price increases YOY considering the climate.",2
"I have just visited White Rose 02 store Leeds and met Khaliq. He has patiently helped my 83 year old father in law move his sim package from an Android to a mobile and set up his Apple ID when he couldn’t today get this working. He was polite, patient, kind and encouraging. A real credit to your company 02 and above all a very important role model for what customer service should be. Thank you so much .",2
"Massive thanks to Shane and Alisha in the Workington store! We received AMAZING customer service from you both today. You went above and beyond to ensure we got everything we needed. Two new iPhones and an iPad all up and running in no time with our data transferred too. It was a pleasure dealing with you, you’re both a credit to O2. Thank you!",2
Am praising the staff Lee and Ashley at Macclesfield O2 shop. They were very helpful and professional after a few calls unable to understand on the call centre. We had just taken out a newer contract with Virgin Media which included a new Sim but it was made very complicated to a Silver Surfer until the Macc staff sorted it out .Thanks for giving me back my sanity x,2
"I have been an o2 customer for over 8 years now, have never had any problems with them. Unfortunately due to losing my job due to ill health, I was unable to pay my bill in full resulting in my services being cut off. I spoke with a member of the finance team, and I’m annoyed at myself for not getting his name, I was upset, embarrassed and slightly emotional! This guy went out of his way to calm me down, was kind, understanding and compassionate and went out of his way to help me in any way he could. His kind words went a long way on a bad day, a customer experience I will never forget! Thankyou",2
"Today After only awaiting a short time , spoke to a fellow Yorkshire person whom is working hard from home for O2.  Lovely lady, we understood every word from her , she explained everything and made sure we understoodand clarified every detail with a friendly, helpful attitude.  Thank you Katie . STAR *****",2
"At the start of my issue. This was  regarding not carrying over of data I had paid for but never used (even though I explained at point of contract I was not in the U.K. for six months and had a Spanish contract for then  ) I would have given only 1 star on here .But then, in all businesses there is a decent and reliable human being who listens and wants to help as best they can. Enter Customer Rep Michaela Wilkinson. Absolutely brilliant and took me from wanting to leave O2 after over 20 years of loyal service to being so impressed it would be indecent of me to change.I’m early retired now but used to be a high level business consultant and I keep filling in the O2 surveys of how they have so many things wrong and hence such a low trust pilot score .The solution is always in front line people (not auto assistants) who have the ability to help and recognise customer loyalty .So this 5 star goes to Michaela Wilkinson on behalf of O2.",2
My daughter ran bill up and they cut it off.they sent me a letter saying I recevie the final bill in few weeks next letter in was a debt collector one I ran 02 and explained and no bother at all recalling it back.i ran back today and got a payment plan in order they were so helpful and understanding couldn't do enough.,2
I would like to thank Ashley at Stockport 02 for sorting my phone problem out ware other stores could not also for being so kind and pleasant 👍,2
"My mum received shocking care from the Taunton branch but THANKFULLY the Bath branch took such great care of her. The managers name I didn’t catch a blonde lady but the gentleman who assisted me and my mum Jourdan has not only excellent customer care, but a real kindness and helped us for well over an hour despite this being another stores mammoth cock up! He was brilliant with my mum who isn’t tech savvy at all and helped massively to get her phone working and her confidant. I hope staff receive good feedback as the bath branch on the 3rd feb 2022 we’re everything a company should be proud of.",2
"Fantastic customer service always received. No overly long waiting times over the phone and sending links to speak to customer service online, unlike one I won't mention. No problems whatsoever during the duration of my contract. So I give five stars.",2
I would just like to say thank you to O2For always offering the best deals but most importantly the O2 priority app.I work for the NHS in the community and there's nothing better than being treated with a free hot drink per week between visits. It honestly means the world to me and makes my day!The cinema tickets are equally rewarding and makes a Monday evening not feel so bad and something to look forward too.Thank you for all that you are offering!!,2
I went to the 02 store in Cleveleys  near Blackpool yesterday for a new contract phone. A young lad called Gaz helped guide me through the different phones on offer within my budget. I felt the need to write this as his customer service skills were amazing. It’s not often nowadays you get a friendly face. But for about 1 hour I had a really nice enjoyable experience within the store from this young lad who was quite new to this job. Training has obviously gone well. So I’d like to say Thankyou & well done team 02 he’s going to do well will make sure to see you next time Gaz 😊,2
"Looking at all these bad reviews I'm quite surprised. I recently upgraded my mobile and was ill advised by a consultant and was signed up with less benefits than was agreed on the phone.Up steps Deborah 'W' who I have to say has surpassed any customer service advisor I have ever cone across. She corrected the previous advisors mistake and spent ages talking through a solution with me.Never have I been told I would be called back and actually receive a call until now. 4 calls in fact. Everything Deborah said she would ring, she rang on the dot. Even a courtesy call that wasn't scheduled.I hope this review gets to the right people within O2 and and Deborah gets to read this. She's a super starHappy customer",2
"This review is based on service received by agent Vasudev on o2 Customer Service Webchat. Vasudev went out of his way to try and resolve a 48 hour DPD delivery delay on my new Iphone. After numerous calls and chats to both DPD and o2 getting nowhere I was at breaking point; stress levels through the roof. He was friendly, very helpful and empathised with my situation. He tried everything possible to try and get my delivery sorted, after DPD kept lying and coming up with various excuses. Though unable to get them to deliver to me the same day that they had promised, (the day after it was initially supposed to arrive, for which I had paid a premium), it did turn up the following morning (3rd day) first thing. I truly believe that had it not been for Vasudev`s intervention and pulling out all the stops to get my order delivered, that I would still be waiting and stressing over where it was and if it was ever going to arrive. Thank you Vasudev. I really appreciate all your efforts. May God bless you and your family.",2
"I have been with Tesco which uses 02 for 10 years and have always had a good reception for calls in that time.  I have broadband at home and mostly use the internet there but at the times that I needed to use internet on my phone outside, I have never found an issue.  I am in Folkestone Kent. I only found that they had bad reviews because I was looking at other providers because Tesco's isn't such good value at the moment and from my point of view, I think they are good provider.",2
"I always find it amazing to see so many negative reviews. I’ve been with O2 for about 9 or 10 years now, and whilst there have been issues, they have always resolved them quickly.Most recently, I upgraded my series 6 Apple Watch Product (red) to a series 7, using O2 Refresh. There was an issue with the website’s stock locator, so I rang the Metro Centre store, confirmed stock, and popped down.I had previously had an issue adding my data plan to a watch, which required O2 to reset everything, and they did that fine for me. Because of that, I set up my watch in store just in case and they were there to help in case it failed, which it didn’t.Wife and I both on O2, definitely offers some of best coverage in the north east of England. I know this because I did switch to Vodafone for a week because when I was due an upgrade they had a deal on, but they had no network at home, or work, or in Huddersfield where I regularly travel. I got a unlimited data sim from Three for my iPad, and that’s slower than O2.I guess every company has their issues and spends on who you get for support, but I’ve found o2 to be an excellent network and I can see myself moving any time soon.",2
I got a new SIM card ten years ago because I'm weird and I change my number every day (and also like false economy s) now ten years on and forty Sims later I need my number to log in to get a tax rebate and they obliged  spoke to a wonderful gentleman on the phone great service,2
I’ve been with o2 for around 15 years now and I’ve never had any problems with them. I’ve just upgraded early to the new iPhone with no hassle and didn’t have any problems with my first ever phone contract with them 2 years ago (I was always sim only and pay as you go before that) delivery is always on time. :) I think I’ll stick around for another while.,2
"Served by Rachael,O2 leicester Beaumont leys store.I bought a new phone on contract and left ID mobile.She explained plan clearly, bills, insurance and made us feel welcomed.Thank you RachaelMr Fletcher",2
"I went to o2 Beaumont store and got served by a lovely lady called Rachael. She is amazing, professional in the manner she speaks. She explained everything clearly and very polite and beautiful. Thank you Rachael for making my experience beautiful. I will visit the store often with friends and family. You are a rare gem and a credit to O2. Angela😍",2
"I would recommend 02, as there value for money and they reward their customers.When you take out a contract with them you get access to 02 priority, ie freebies each week like free coffee and food",2
"Excellent service from 02 shop in Yeovil. Answered my query, fixed the issue I was having within 5 minutes, and with very pleasant, polite service. Highly recommended. Thanks!",2
Called in O2 shop in Nuneaton on Sunday for advice on replacement phone. The chap was the most helpful of any O2 shop we have been in. His customer service was exceptional and this prompted us to buy a phone. Nothing was too much trouble and he even checked which day he was next in just in case we had any problem. He deserves to go far.,2
Spoke to Terrence over the phone from Glasgow. He understood my situation and didn't just seem like an advisor who was just doing his job. He went above and beyond to help and naturally seemed like a person who cared about peoples situation. I got the help and more from that phone call - people who care make a big difference. Keep up the good work Terrence!,2
My own experience has actually been really good with 02. I live in North Cornwall and switched from three because of no to sketchy signal.at homeHad a new mate 20 pro comtract £20 a month (4gig plus unlimited) thought that was very competitive.Still got the phone but went to £6 month sim only (6gig plus unlimited) the changover was seamless and correct and the coverage for me is excellent,2
I went into O2 store in Swan Centre Eastleigh as I was out of contract with my phone.   The staff were brilliant and Graham dealt with the transfer of info from the old phone to the new phone.   Graham was very knowledgeable and was extremely helpful and friendly.  Matt who we have dealt with previously was warm and welcoming.  It was a pleasure to go into the store and have such good customer service.  Well done O2 from a very grateful customer.,2
"We are a couple of seniors who have just acquired our first ever smartphone, choosing 02 as our provider.  They have a system of a 'guru' in post at each shop, to guide ingenues like us, so we booked an appointment with James, the Oxford Westgate Centre Guru.  We were not disappointed.  James answered all our picayune questions with expert patient ease.  At the end of our long session, we felt confident about using the phone.  What an excellent idea:  having a Resident Guru.  And thank you, James.",2
"My father had an accident and Louise from Gateshead Metro Centre was fantastic.   She looked after my mother, called me, supported my mam whilst the ambulance arrived.   I can’t thank your amazing team member enough.   Thank you",2
"I had a very serious complaint against a man working in an O2 store, who made me and my partner feel incredibly uncomfortable, committed fraud and then put me in debt with O2. I called a line today, and was put through to a young man called Steven. Honestly, a call I was dreading was made simple, and I felt cared for, by that lovely man. He absolutely made me feel listened to, he took his time with my complaint, and called me back to tell me there was an investigation going on and I will be updated every step of the way. Honestly, this man is a credit to the company. If you're getting all these bad reviews about customer service, yet I had a very pleasant one even with a very hard topic... he's a great one! Thank you Steven if you're reading this, you're a credit to the company you work for.",2
"I am confused by other reviews.  I had a difficult problem dealt with initially by 'chat'; I was advised to pursue resolution by talking to the relevant department. Everyone was polite, friendly and efficient and the problem was resolved with no difficulty.  It was taking some time so I was advised to 'ring off' and I would be called back.  That was what happened in a short time frame.  In brief a 5* experience",2
"Sab, Olly & Flick at the Clifton Down store were all absolutely amazing. So lovely to chat to, and crazy helpful. I got so frustrated with the online services live chat, but as soon as I got in store they took the time to explain what had happened and how to rectify it. Got me a lovely new phone, with a comfortable chat and no extreme upselling; they seemed very genuinely interested in helping me get the phone I needed. Thanks so much gang!",2
"Reading the reviews is insane. Been with o2 for 3 years, contract ran out as paid my phone off and switched onto another o2 contract, all went fine.I have also just bought a new phone for my daughter for xmas and all was easy peasy there too.The app is fantastic. You get airtime rewards. So for example, I add my debit card and whenevr I shop at say primark or greggs ect money comes off my bill. Great for a teenager too which is why I've now got her on the same :)Looking at some reviews it seems some people are complaining about their own errors. Example, leaving o2 in contract is always going to be an issue for any network, signal is always going to be an issue in some areas, not really o2s fault, just get over it until you move to a new location, people complaining about paying a high monthly cost out of contract, well how is that there fault, ensure you keep an eye on your contract when it runs out change it so its lower or get a new contract, simple...",2
Had a great experience in woolwich O2- Yamin made the process of upgrading my phone super easy and helped me to find the exact deal I wanted. Couldn't have wished for better service!,2
"I have been with O2 since I owned the iPhone 4S (the good ol' days). Since then I have owned several handsets with O2, either by taking out a deal with them directly or by signing up for a new deal through a third party such as Carphone Warehouse.I can honestly say that I have never experienced a single problem with this provider during my tenure with them. I have contacted them on several occasions with general queries, switching mobile numbers etc. and each time has been a breeze (I mainly used webchat).Recently I have switched to another network, only because I now work for said network and receive quite a hefty discount.There are quite a lot of complaints regarding this network, either on Trust Pilot or social media, but the same complaints apply to each and every network. Everyone has their own viewpoint or issue with a network, big or small. You may go to another network such as EE and have a wonderful experience, or leave EE and join O2 because you've have a dreadful experience. You can't please everyone I suppose!I will undoubtedly be returning to O2 in the future I'm sure.",2
"Purchased an IPhone 13 pro online at Vodafone… the next day I got a text saying they were out of stock.. waited 2 weeks but still nothing.. ended up cancelling the order.I also went into Manchester to the apple Store and they had none either. Searched around everywhere.Finally, went to my current provider (O2) and was amazed that their website had them as ‘in stock’… I ordered it and was expecting a ‘we’re sorry’ email but was amazed that they said they’d deliver it the next day… and they did.. great customer service. One happy customer… data rates are a bit higher than most but other than that.. brilliant!",2
I had a guy from the Burnley store his name began with a Z and he sorted me a phone out within one working day it was my first contract and I had no clue what I was doing he was amazing and so helpful I can’t praise him enough! He also helped my partner know about how much he had left on his contractHe helped me decide what plan and what phone would be suitable for me,2
I've been with O2 about 8 years now. I always have great service from them. Would recommend.,2
Excellent service and customer careI joined O2 last week and my new sim card arrived 2 days later.  The sim activated immediately and I was up and running straight away.  My old number was ported 2 days later and the whole operation was seamless.  10/10 o2 for such an efficient operation.  I called customer care to check on my old number porting and they couldn’t have been more helpful.  Having suffered at the hands of Virgin mobile for 6 weeks this is a welcome relief and I cannot recommend o2 highly enough.,2
"I have to say a big thank you to 02, have been a client for as long as I can remember and they have never let me down. Customer service is second to none, this morning they guided me to a different plan and I am more than grateful.",2
"Would highly recommend O2 Insurance! I have had my phone for 3 years and never had to claim but typically a week before I had paid off my phone I dropped it and the whole screen was cracked. The Insurance team were brilliant, very reassuring and talked me through all my options whilst being very supportive - they told me I could get my phone collected at my door and a replacement delivered the next day and this is exactly what happened - SO SO SIMPLE! Have had to jump through hoops to claim on insurance before and this was so simple and easy during a stressful time, thank you!",2
"Been with O2 for many years. Any issue raised such as no signal was easily raised and sorted out within 48hrs, along with updates along the way.The app is easy to use, able to pay the montly bill early if needed or easily upgraded to a new plan.",2
"Got a 02 sim contract,I'm still very unhappy with them,but I'm giving them 5 star, im a Vodafone customer been very happy with them. But switched to 02 just to see how they are, still 6 month and still need to wait for a phone contract  With Vodafone just 3 month and they offered me a phone contract. I didn't check the reviews before I switch to 02. Now I'm seeing so many negative reviews for 02. I'm still thinking to stay with 02 or to switch to another network.",2
Shaun and Travis were so helpful when there was an issue changing from PAYG to contract. They valued my time and were on the ball how to help. Issue all fixed quickly!,2
Where do I even start? The customer service from Brian King was fantastic and went above and beyond for myself. Explained my entire situation gave me fantastic advice all the way through reassuring me everything will be ok! Talked me through everything completely and set me a new plan. I hope o2 have more Brian’s because the customer service will excel with individuals such as him.I got confused a few times and he was so polite and professional from start to finish ensuring I was happy. Not only that it’s helped me keep in contact with my daughter whom I’m awaiting important hospital appointments for. Brian took above and beyond to a new level and can’t thank him enough!I hope o2 have a reward scheme because if he’s the same to me as every customer something is being done correct by him and deserves recognition!Thank you Brian and thank you for your outstanding customer service.10/10 for everything,2
"Fantastic customer service from Karen Boardman. Gave great advice. Although I am a little sad because I reported an aesthetic impairment with the handset during the warranty and it wasn't logged sufficiently, the kindness was wonderful. We cannot take our frustrations out on customer service representatives because they are front line and deal with most of the back office's mistakes of mismanagement and lack of organisation. I really hope I am offered a good deal on my new contract to compensate for the devices issues, however, in future I will return to this representative because she is an asset to this company. <3 Melanie",2
"Noticed yesterday that I had been charged for text messages from Premium number for the past 3 months and not even received them in my message box. Phoned 02 customer services and the lady was so professional, reassuring and helpful that she put my mind at rest. Don't come across such caring people very often. Thank you",2
I had a very pleasant experience speaking to a lady named Jackie from the O2 Business customer service team. She went above and beyond to help resolve my issue and was very polite and kind whilst doing so.,2
"I needed to contact a specific team in O2, I found the details on the website. Sent my email with the details, received the automatic reply saying they aim to reply in 5 days but due to current demand it may take longer.  It did take longer, but as they resolved this was no issue for me. I had a call today from the team at O2. He explained what he had done, gave advice, was polite and friendly. Thank you.",2
"Went to 02 in Westfield, Stratford was only enquiring about the Samsung Z fold, phone as well as the S7 Plus tablet, the young girl Tejiri, gave me the information needed about the monthly cost as well as upfront cost, and the total cost through the 48 month period. It was not busy at around just before 1 pm, so was seen straight away, without any waiting. Service was professional and no complaints.",2
"Switched to O2 this week and I am extremely pleased with the experience.  The O2 advisors were helpful when I had a little difficulty porting my existing number and sorted the whole thing out for me.  So far, a great service and about the cheapest too.",2
John was a pleasure to speak with and gave me the price and peace if mind for 24 months.,2
"A big complement to O2. After creating a chaos in ""MyO2"" account, they not only solved this in minutes, a much, much, better deal and a new sim card within a day. Next day in the Netherlands, within 2 minutes roaming on and full internet.  Thanks O2 team, well done.",2
I was speaking to a lovely lady Gill this morning and she went beyond more to help me and I'm ever so greatfull.,2
Been a loyal customer with o2 for several years- can find everything you need through the app. Had no real problems at all with customer service.I love the priority app too!,2
"I didn’t receive my sim as planned via post and decided to pop down to my local O2 store in Evesham this afternoon. I wish I had asked for her name as she provided me with such lovely customer service and spent time talking to me about the latest Apple Watch (as I am an avid Apple user!). Thankyou so much, I really appreciate all the help given.",2
"Had the best experience with o2 customer services. Joined they're network briefly to buy a specific phone. Once my 14 days passed, called to cancel my contract. Unfortunately they misunderstood what I meant, and charged me an extra month. Called to confirm my cancellation and they were kind, really friendly and refunded me the extra month they charged by mistake.I'm sticking to my current network, as I prefer my pay as you go provider, but I absolutely appreciated the easiness of sorting out my cancellation",2
"I've been with O2 for a few years now. I use services (which O2 provides me with) at O2 branch in Essex, Southend-on-sea (The High Street) This is the place I'd like to give my feedback on.You will be greated with positive energy and smile there.Your concerns/issues will be listened.The best possible option will be offered which suits you best.Your needs will be met.This is the place, where you feel looked after.So without any hesitation, I give 5 stars out of 5My big personal and exceptional ""Thank you"" to the manager of this O2 branch.Thank youYours sincerely,Dr.Asta Galentiene",2
Very happy with my call from Shantal as she very clearly explained what had happened with my discount and then applied for it to be out on for me!,2
"I bought an iPhone 8 from a reputable refurbished phone shop and went to my local 02 shop in Sittingbourne to get a sim only deal, the young lady then pointed out that the phone I had purchased was working correctly but it had a repaired screen that was incorrectly fitted and would probably fail if knocked so she then accompanied me to the retailer and returned the phone and I came away with an A grade iPhone 7 which is immaculate and after transferring all my contacts etc. sent me on my way - this was a very good example of going out of her way to help an old codger into the 21st century for which I am extremely grateful.",2
Shaheen was a huge help after the online messaging could not help AT ALL. The online service would not accept that I only had one phone and all my service were completely cut off. They still insisted (despite living alone and just coming out of isolation) that I had to find another phone and call.But then I ran to someone who thankfully lent me their phone and let me sort this out.And Shaheem happened! He was patient and naturally frustrated with endless complaints and anger and dealt with me so well and got me my services back and even more! He's a star and if O2 don't give him a raise then there's no justice.CarlPs I suggest that o2 find a way during this Corona virus pandemic to allow people to use the one phone that they have. It's no ones fault to be isolated. Thank God you have Shaheem,2
"Just upgrade my phone at the store in Tunbridge Wells. The customer service was excellent, everything was explained really well and the whole process was super simple.",2
I want to post this review about Adam in the o2 shop in Cramlington. He kindly set up my new 12 pro and was extremely Helpful and  pleasant. I bought the phone online from o2 so he didn’t get any benefit..He is a credit to o2.,2
"I had already purchased my 24 month contract and switched over when I saw the reviews - and I was quite scared of what would happen. I had a horrendous experience with Three - no 4G ever, impossible to hear anyone over the phone, etc etc (I won't bore you). But since I made the switch, my life has been made so much easier because of O2. I have signal EVERYWHERE (I used to have just one bar when I was at home, with wifi), and have great network service so far.Also, Asad who sorted out my contract in store in Stratford was a gem. Honestly, the best customer service I've ever had in my life. That guy sets the standard - gold star service, and he's a super guy. I was dealing with Three over the phone while I was switching over, and he handled everything seamlessly. Made my life so easy. Give that guy a raise. I'll be recommending him and O2 to everyone.",2
"I recently purchased a Mobile WiFi system from O2 shop in Burnley Lancs. Had great service from two lovely, professional, patient young ladies Zaibaa and Jodie.Brilliant experience!!",2
I was scammed almost out of 1000 pounds luckily the man I spoke to helped me sort it out quickly and efficiently. Great service in my opinion.,2
"I have to say the team at O2 in Loughborough is simply brilliant.  Thank you Sayfur, Ian, Chirag, Kay and Sam.  If you want to know about customer service talk to this team.  They helped me upgrade my phone and helped every step of the way to ensure everything was transferred. We hit a few issues but they worked out how to do it, nothing was too much. Thank you for the time, effort and customer service to make me smile and recommend O2 to my friends.",2
"Today my sister and I went into our local Wrexham store. These shops can sometimes feel a little intimidating, especially if you are a technophobe.We had a lovely salesman to serve us though and he was very patient and understanding. He took him time to set up everything and explained everything that we needed to know. He was absolutely brilliant. Many thanks Anthony at Wrexham 02 store.Perhaps Anthony could give some sales tips to his colleague however who we could hear being a little passive aggressive in his sales approach.",2
Stephen van Rooyen my South African hero !!!Stephen helped me with my query and resolved the issue with speed and confidence.Spoke to me the whole time and was very professional.A credit to o2Thank you so much.,2
"I cancelled voicemail with O2  many months ago , now it is back on my phone . Unable to contact customer service at o2 , as at least 30 minute wait , also no chat on line . I have rang the number given 1760 to cancell my voicemail , but got a auomated voice message '' contact your provider , which is impossble as stated above . Then i tried the ##002# as was suggested  by someone , but got message on my phone , which was a red cross and the word unfinished.

"As a regular 02 user (pay as you go) I decided to update  my mobile, having got the phone I needed to move the data from the old one which left me at a loss, contacted the Newton Abbot 02 shop, Nathan, who gave me an appointment for the following day, Friday 25 June.Welcomed at the door by a nice friendly young lady, then met Nathan, took my details and phones, asked politely to came back 45mins later, job done well, clear explanation by Nathan who was very professional and a credit to O2 and its service, thanks to the Newton Abbot team, Gerry Jessett",2
After difficulties updating my address (new build address not recognised) I completed a feedback form.I received a call back from a very friendly and professional female who resolved the issue within minutes!Great service O2. Thank you so much for helping me.,2
Stephen Rooyen provided me with an outstanding excellent service,2
"I had a wonderful experience on Wednesday 16th of June 2021 during a phone call to O2 Customer Service.The call was with Pamela and I made the call at 09:11 am regarding a mobile for one of my O2 contracts (I have three).Pamela was absolutely wonderful. She was very knowledgeable, assertive, truly helpful and kind. She was patient and creative in finding ways to help me with my problem. I was quite anxious and her calm manner helped put me at ease and she managed to resolve my problem. I'm so grateful.Thank you very much to Pamela, absolute star!",2
"I called Customer Services after coming up against some difficulties applying a discount I’d been promised, online. I spoke to Stephen Van Rooyen, based in Cape Town, and wow, what a service. He spent time figuring out how to resolve the issue, was considerate, attentive and kept me informed throughout. He even called me back two days later with an update. He showed integrity, he was really friendly and we chatted for more than he is probably allowed but he was so bloody lovely, I didn’t want to let him go! Thanks for an incredible service and for resolving my issue, it’s much appreciated.",2
Really enjoyed our trip up the O2 this afternoon. One off the bucket list. Thank you Jacob.,2
"Amazing customer service. They changed my number immediately and explained to me, to understand, my issue with the contract. Thank you very much 5 🌟",2
"I recently had a fraud order made on my O2 account, where fraudsters had tried to order new iPhone. As soon as I realised I got straight in touch with O2’s customer support who where really helpful in resolving the issue for me, so that I wouldn’t be liable for the cost of the phone or the contract. I can’t rate their customer support service highly enough!",2
"Well I’ve just been to the 02 phone shop in Northwick, I can honestly say the staff and service was fantastic. I would definitely go there again. A big thank you for all your help.Melvin",2
"Went in today to query a few things, left with a new phone and a cheaper contract as it turned out that due to the phone I wanted, there was a way for me to trade in my old one, pay off my term early and have a large upfront payment, was very happy. Every time I have gone into the high wycombe store the staff have always been accommodating and helpful, so much so my partners even switching to O2 as he's so impressed by how I'm treated, even after being with them for so long.",2
"I rung 02 this Aftanoon an spoke to a Stephen Van Rooyen,this guy doesn’t no me from Adam,an he went well an beyond 2 solve my problem.He is a DIAMOND an 02 should employ more people like him,an I’m very happy an  PLEASED TO SAY THAT IM TOTALLY HAPPY WITH THE OUT COME,an that he totally DESERVES THE 5STAR rating that iv given him,KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK Stephen.👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿",2
"I would like to send a BIG Thank you to James the manager and James the assistant manager at the O2 store in Middleton Manchester. They relentlessly tried to solve the problem of my phone, which was lost in transit from the repair centre for an hour and a half. I am extremely grateful for their support and commitment in solving this problem. O2 are lucky to have such supportive staff. Thank you to you both 😊",2
Brilliant help from Stephen. He was able to explain causes of my phone problems and was a fountain of information. He was very pleasant and made sure I was happy with the help and info he gave me.  Highly recommended.,2
Stephen my advisor was most helpful in dealing with an ongoing query over the past 3-4 weeks which sadly hadn’t been resolved & completed by other members of staff to my frustration. He was well spoken & polite throughout our conversation & kept me informed of the process throughout.,2
"Sean and the team here in O2 Macclesfield have been outstanding. The device I wanted wasn’t available in store however went the extra mile to have it couriered the following morning.They found the right package for my excessive use. Store was impeccable in standards,PPE was worn by the whole team whom looked immaculate. Have been a customer of O2 for over 30 years in this day & age it’s challenging to find excellent customer care especially as the e-commerce is a popular destination for the masses.Thanks guys see you shortly",2
"WOW I can't believe  the bad experience some have had! It's usually the the usual suspects, haven't got a good word for anybody anything! Find fault......02 are or have been  with me BEAUTIFUL,  I've been with Vodafone, ee,  they  need to keep on taking them.All others pigy back there networks.02 so sweet!!!@@ play nice.",2
Brilliant customer service. I’ve been with o2 as my phone provider for around 15 years and they’ve always been great.I placed an order through today for an upgrade and spoke to two advisors who were both amazing and very friendly.I had an issue with the first order and called back and was helped by Lee who was superb. He went the extra mile to guide me through the process and to rectify the problem.Both calls were answered almost immediately after getting through the options and my queries were answered quickly by very friendly advisors.,2
Best customer service ever. Arun was very helpful very patient with all my questions.,2
Today I've called O2 and I'm so pleased and amazed how quick and easy the help was aragend for me.Unfortunately I forgot lady name..Ruben I think It was or Robyn.I would like to thank you for sending me the information so quickly.,2
"I received a call from Harry M, said he was a week new at the company and clearly knew his stuff. I upgraded my phone and am very happy with the deal.",2
"I don't understand all the bad reviews on here.Moved back to o2 at the beginning of last year. Hassle free porting number and setting it all up. Since then, I have a great signal and 4g.Last month I visited a store to purchase a smart watch. Again, hassle free and the service I recieved was amazing.",2
"Went into Macclesfield Store today to see about upgrading iPhone. Great advice from Tom with different options, prices and advice looking forward to the future. No pressure selling, very comfortable and as always will go back into that store as have used them for at least the last 10 years. Staff have always been very helpful in there.",2
"Timely professional help. I had the sad task of closing my Dad’s mobile phone account, with O2 (loss of capacity due to severe head injury). The chain of live phone communication and 2-3 straight forward emails, between us, with their want and willingness to help (from one human being to another) made it a caring and effortless experience. Thank you so much.",2
"Recently upgraded my Samsung phone with o2 at the Hedge End Southampton Shop in Next store. Terrific assistance from both the staff members in helping with my choice, this followed by excellent service in setting up my new phone and transferring all data from my old phone.I have been an o2 customer for more years than I can remember, only ever had a couple of queries, which were dealt with efficiently.Well done.",2
"Been with O2 for a few years and the team in store have always been friendly and helpful for all issues I have been in for. Sometimes getting the team members getting in touch with customer services can result in a wait, but having that face to face reassurance and pointers on how to get additional use out of my devices has been great for me",2
Jack Magee absolutely brilliant after being messed around for half an hour and kicked from the previous call this man is brilliant thank you jack all the best,2
I am O2 customer for many years but few times I was tempted to check other providers and will definitely stay with O2 only. If anyone complains about O2 services or customer advisors I strongly recommend to check others to see how bad it can be as you clearly have no idea.I actually don’t have to contact customer service often because everything is working with no problem. If there is anything I’m not happy about it is always resolved quickly and professionally (even during COVID). My upgrades are also always smooth process with great offers. Customer advisors every time are helpful and professional so I can’t remember I had to call twice for the same thing. If any follow up was needed they were contacting me.Not a cheapest network - fact - but at least you know what you are paying for. Years of hassle free use are worth it.,2
"Had a great experience chatting with Jane Howard (I hope that's her name) and setting up my phone upgrade last week.  I really felt like she had the time to talk me through the process and also make a personal connection.  Being in the wellbeing industry I am all about connections, which is the most important of the five ways to wellbeing (as defined by New Economics Foundation).  Thanks for taking the time for asking a bit about me and making me laugh.",2
BEST COVERAGE ABOUT!!! EVEN WITH GIFFGAFF,2
"I recently spoke to an O2 advisor (David) earlier this afternoon. However, I would like to write a positive review (to be passed to O2 management/customer service), as I felt highly satisfied with the phone call - as though I was talking to a friend/relative. This is because David made me feel comfortable, happy, relaxed whilst talking to him throughout the phone call. Besides talking about any queries I had with my contract & being able to resolve them quickly & effectively, I also had a personal conversation with David about “everyday chitchat”. If I had to sum up David; he’s warm, polite, friendly, courteous, helpful, charismatic, assertive, supportive & (if given the chance), would definitely love to talk to David again, in the future. Also, for any customers who have possibly taken out a contract/had problems with a different phone company - I would highly recommend O2 (I will be staying with O2 when my contract expires).",2
Absolutely fantastic company. No problems at all.,2
"Spoke to a very helpful colleague today named @John. I had trouble trying to take out a new contract for over one week and this guy helped me and was extremely patient. He explained everything and answered all my questions! He was on the phone with me for 1hr 30mins and not once rushed the call, instead he sorted out the issue and helped me take out a new contract. He was such a lovely gentleman and genuinely did everything he could to help me! I’ve spoken to many colleagues from o2 over 3 years of being with them and not once have I ever experienced bad customer service. I can’t thank John enough and the o2 team; every time I have rang for anything they have been extremely helpful! The network has been amazing and I cannot recommend them enough! Excellent service 👍🏼 Well done and thank you again 🙌🏼",2
"From roqueHer name is Amy from o2 customer service went extra mile to solve my issue as i  wanted a help to keep my old number , i tried on o2 app , it was asking me for 2 character which i had no idea about it so she sorted my issues about the problem without any hesitation.Keep it up. Excellent.",2
"Really surprised by the low rating here. I just used their online chat to resolve a problem with text messages. My bank was trying to send me a temporary password that I was not receiving.  I open the chat on their site, and they solved my problem in less than 10 minutes.  Never really interact with O2 otherwise but on this first interaction they were brilliant!",2
O2 your the best .Lovely customer service although expensive I still value you .Thank you for looking after me and being understanding I’ll be with you forever .Always the best service and a lovely customer service thanks again .I’m truly loyal ….Thank youZara,2
Ordered an Apple Watch from O2 the order was placed and arrived the next dayEasy to use website and easy to find what I needed including tariffWell done O2,2
OMG thank you soooo much o2. Sending me an alert on a text message while I’m on the phone to whom I thought was 02 ( fraudster) just about to tell them the code. This is the best thing any company has done. I feel like you literally pulled me out the wrong door. I’m so grateful THANKYOUStrongly defiantly recommend o2,2
"I was in a real fix communication-wise and ill and a friend sent me an O2 sim card via you-know-who. The instructions were straightforward and my phone adjusted after restarting. I didn't need to reload Whatsapp etc. I am really grateful for the easy transition. Yesterday, I noticed the same sim card in my local supermarket, so next time I'm in a fix, I'll know what to do for £10.",2
I spoke to Kim at 02 today and she was very polite and helpful! Definitely the best service I’ve got so far from o2!,2
I phoned 202 and nicola answered.( I think thats her name) She has amazing customer service. I'm not lying. I asked 50 questions and she was patient the whole way. She needs a promotion definitely. Changing sim was extremely simple gave me a great deal and don't have to do anything extra no ordering a new sim.,2
"I been an O2 customers for 4 years. I am honestly surprised about the bad customer service reviews. Whenever I had to phone them I was always able to solve my issue in less than 5 minutes, friendly, professional and straightforward customer service. My coverage was always great in London. The only reason why I am leaving  after 4 years because I found a better deal. Other than that I highly recommend it.",2
"I just spoke to someone called Kyle. He was informative, clear, knowledgable and to be honest, seemed like a proper top bloke. I’ve been with O2 for years so I know what to expect and how the process works when I upgrade my phone. After having concerns with completing the form on the app, Kyle took me through it step by step. It didn’t feel patronising or ‘salesy’, it was a really comfortable and pleasant experience. I felt completely at ease with the whole process and this is because of Kyle. I have never written a good review for someone before as I haven’t ever received such a good service that I felt I needed to commend someone. A true credit to O2, if someone can please ensure his line manager is informed that would be greatly appreciated.Also, I’ve been with O2 for years and have found them to be helpful if there is an issue. My most recent phone had a problem with it and they arranged a replacement without any hassle. I’ve also entered into their competitions on O2 priority and won many prizes - although I enter daily!Thank you, Madison",2
Just came over to O2 from BT. Porting my number went great. Free Disney Plus for six months too. So far so good.,2
"Early days but can’t be happier!Got sim only plan just 12GB for tenner so really cheap.Have Pixel 5 and getting over 200Mbps in my location (Liverpool). Since I’m working from home so pretty much on WiFi all the time 12GB is plenty!Switched from Three, they put two 5G mast in the city and claimed coverage. O2 has like 50% covered!Love it.",2
"Mohammad was extremely helpful, very nice and understanding of my situation and was very clear throughout, very pleased with my service today",2
I’m a new customer to o2 I joined on 18th January on a sim only from Vodafone my number was ported to o2 on the 19th without a problem. Ive done some speed tests and its way better than Vodafone I’m getting 175:20 Mb/s download and 8.60 Mb/s upload in my area NG19 which is a 5g area. Not tried calling customer service so can’t comment on that.,2
The best network 02 for best coverage with strong signal and customer services  are excellent  sorting out my problems. 02 have more masts than any other networks in UK. I joined 02 on 12.01.2021from Three Network.,2
"Reliable company, been with them for many years.",2
"I have been with O2 for 4 years, always had great customer service and great upgrades plans 👌🏻",2
"Dave, has been absolutely helpful and understanding during this pandemic he’s great at doing his job even though Ive annoyed him  please recognise his carisma and his hard work!",2
"customer service resolved and very empathetic, was a poor review but they turned it around",2
I went into the Macclesfield 02 shop yesterday to buy a new iPhone. I was served by Tom who was extremely helpful and proactive.,2
l lost my phone over Christmas which is unusual for me so quite worried as my mother is in a care home. went into the O2 shop in Macclesfield should have had ID which l hadn't on me but when l explained my concerns l was looked after and taken through all security checks. Thanks Tom for all your help you were so helpful and had me sorted with a new phone in no time. Excellent first class service.,2
"Hi thanks for the most amazing service I have ever received, Ben was super helpful and went out of his way to help me, I was in a dilemma where I was paying too much every month, he was so empathetic and honest and did his very best to see what he can do for me! He managed to get me a cheaper deal and I am now a customer for life! Can’t thank him enough! He deserves a pay rise !! Deserves a bonus!Ben taylor concentrixs team.Needs a promotion!",2
One of the best networks in UK. Good enough to go,2
I can only give 5 stars to a certain customer support agent Jack Edwards from the Dearne Valley call centre in Rotherham. He was absolutely brilliant and sorted out our problem. We cannot thank him enough. Previously we made numerous phone calls all ending in either being cut off or saying they could not help giving 1 star service. We then went to a shop and they could not help either. So a massive thank you to Jack Edwards in the Dearne Valley call centre for giving us a little faith in 02. Very much appreciated.,2
"Just a quick review to say thank you to Tracy T (complaints) who resolved my issue in a single afternoon.Always refreshing for such a speedy resolution and got me back a hefty £224 that had been taken in error.Thanks again,Emily",2
"I spoke to Gerry today who was really lovely, chatty, and thorough. Was planning on leaving O2 but was convinced to stay as he was really helpful in finding a plan that suited me. Related to me as a customer, and ensured i had all of the information I needed to feel comfortable moving forward. Thanks Gerry!",2
O2 suggested that i should purchase an ipad for my studies and i can honestly say this has been the best purchased i've ever made. its like they knew what i needed and what was the perfect fit for me. thank you O2!!,2
"Amazing and understanding customer service, rang as struggling financially. So sympathetic and willing to help. Plus 02Have fantastic referral service for customer who have difficulties in interacting in making calls etc. I simply can not fault how brilliant the service was. Thank you 02",2
"I can't believe how many negative reviews there are about this company - have they been dealing with the same provider that I have?I've been an o2 customer since I was about 13 years old (I'm now 25), and I've never had any problems with them.I've been due an upgrade since March 2020, but I couldn't be bothered to visit my local branch, so just decided to upgrade on the My o2 app. I'd never done this before, but it was actually SO simple. I ordered my new phone at 9PM yesterday and unbelievably it arrived within 12 hours - how good is that?Also, just wanted to say that the 'My o2' app is really useful and easy to use!",2
"I recently switched from Vodafone. It wasn't bad, but they couldn't deliver a basic decent 4G speed for 3 years. Also, never listened to the feedback. Launching a 5G network with big hoo-ha without stabilising the local 4G networks is a bad business strategy.So, I switched to O2. My personal experience is good so far. I have now decent speed, and the customer service knows what they are doing. I made them thinking hard, trust me. :))) I like the O2 app as well, it's clear and simple and straight forward and not like Vodafone, O2 don't try to push down all the irrelevant offers in my throat. I can manage better my account as well, it's just working well as expected. They have decent automated messaging service in place, so whenever I made some changes compared to the other providers I got more reassurance at O2 about what is going on, then the others (Vodafone and EE).",2
After dreadful customer service from Carphone Warehouse I chose to trade in my phone at 02 at the Gyle store in Edinburgh. First class customer service and took around 10minutes max to sort. Difference between the 2 is night and day.,2
"I have tried and moved to many other mobile network providers over the years. I now always buy my own mobile phone and get a 12 month sim only deal 40GB data, unlimited minutes & unlimited texts for £8 per month. I always setup a spend cap, premium rate bars and limits on my account to stop any nasty surprises on my monthly bill. It would be fantastic if bars could be turned on or off in the My O2 app please. Thank you.",2
"Hi, today i just had a remarkable experience on the phone with one of the employees of your Payment Management department, his name is Colin. He was very professional, patient, kind and he explains with knowledge and a very nice voice to listen to all the details about my case. I was very impressed and I would like to congratulate him and your company on his outstanding customer service special in these days.",2
Best phone company on the market by far 👌👌👌👌👌,2
"Needed to order a new micro sim, 02 sorted it out straight away and I was back up a running in no time! Thanks Amanda Lawrence for all your help",2
"The O2 store at Morfa, Swansea went the whole 9 yards to ensure that a new mobile phone was set up perfectly. It was not an easy set and took place over a few days, some issues arose that needed a coordinated effort within O2.Could not be happier with the level of customer service and effort.",2
Sanna is a star! The most helpful customer service consultant. I had an issue to activate my business account and manage to fix it. Also explained to me why my data usage was so high although I haven't used it.I'm very happy of how helpful sanna was to me.Thanks sanna🤞,2
I just wanted to leave a fantastic review for an absolute star who has been helping me. Christopher edge. He has helped every step of the way with my upgrade/switching from another network. Thank you Chris!,2
"I've been an O2 customer with multiple contracts for over 10 years and I've never had any problems with them.Service is almost perfect and when it comes to renewing and upgrading, I always find they'll provide the very best offers available.I really couldn't find fault in the service I've received.",2
Was in the Glasgow Fort O2 shop and was served by John who did an excellent job of switching all my data on my old phone over to the new handset.   I had a bad experience of O2 in Braehead where the guy who was serving me basically told me to go home and google this and watch a U tube video.   Needless to say I left the shop without changing my contract.   I cannot praise John at the Glasgow Fort enough.,2
WowTook advantage of Black Friday 2020 deal.  Not only saved 17% on phone but delivery was amazing with no charge!!!Ordered 7:30pm Sunday arrived 9:30 am Monday,2
"Great service, Great company.Enough said",2
"Rang O2 today to get some help with switching my tariff for a payg sim as I am in need of waaaay more data and I was running out. Although my request was a bit difficult as I have already changed it once this week, they still found a way to do it at no extra cost. I would like to say thanks to Jaamine and her manager for being absolute superstars! Thanks again!",2
"Very good coverage. Very good customer service, exceptional price.",2
I saw Ryan on the 4th November to change my sons tariff in Stirling Scotland branch.Ryan was helpful and patient and had a friendly and supportive manner.I will definitely be returning to that branch when I’m due and upgrade. Thank you!,2
If you want great customer service I highly recommend Jacob he has been really helpful with our transactions. A really lovely guy to speak through everything with and went above and beyond.,2
"This review is for Paul at the Coventry 02 store.In brief after my Dad purchased a new phone, he had numerous issues with it and was getting charged daily for services he wasn’t using. After several frustrating calls to customer service and lots of different advise that got us nowhere and practically made the phone unusable.We went back to the store, Paul sorted the phone out, suggested a better tariff for Dads needs and reset everything for him.Dad was so grateful for his professionalism and time, asked me to put a review on in the hope he receives the recognition deserved.",2
"I honestly don’t see all the hate for 02. Never had a problem with them. Straight to the point when setting up the contracts without them sneaky little add ones. Just people need to aswell ask, reads, double and triple check before signing them. Good service and got good deals from them",2
"I am so shocked with O2's rating here.  It doesn't make sense!  I've been with them since they were BT, before it became BT Cellnet, before Cellnet and then O2.Over the many years with this company I have seen it develop a lot but the things that always keeps me with them are their customer service, their fairness and their reliability.So, how the hekk in hell are O2 only getting an average rating of less than 2*s?  I can only envisage two reasons for this.  The 1st is that many of the reviews are not from O2's customers.  I just can't believe so many genuine customers would think so lowly of them.  The other reason is that those rating O2 so lowly have never experienced the customer service of the other network providers.  EE already had terrible service and now they are now owned by BT I can just imagine how much further they will go to prove they are the worst.All people I know, except one, is on O2 and all have exactly the same experience as me.  If they have a problem, they call O2 and the call is ansered within seconds, not days like other companies.  Additionally, when you get to speak to somebody at O2, that person takes ""responsibility"" for your query, issue, complaint etc. and that person stays with you until all is resolved.  With other networks, it can take days of trying to get through as even when a call is answered it's only so they can put you on hold for as long as it takes before you lose patience and hang up.  When you do finally get through to sopmebody they either put you on hold until you go away or they pass you through to somebody else, who passes you to somebody else etc. etc. until you give up going around in circles with nobody taking responsibility for your query.So, with my decades of experience with O2, I really wish I could score them 5,000* so I can wipe out the fake and the unfair revues and leave enough to outweigh future fake and unfair reviews for quite some time.Sadly, I can't score more than the 5* so that is what I have given.  I highly recommend O2 and have done so for many years and not a single person that I have encouraged to switch to O2 has had any regret.",2
"The service that I have received from 02 in Kensington High Street has always been very good and professional. But yesterday I collected my new I-phone 12 Pro from Mr Rohan Ramaiya at 10AM and he simply couldnt have been more helpful, patient and incredibly efficient. He went out of his way to ensure that I got the tarrif and all the various accessories that I needed without pushing me into buying unecessary items. He was absolutely first class in every respect.This is a store that I can really recommend for all one's mobile phone needs. Thank you all for being such a great team.",2
"I ordered an iPhone 12 from O2 which I have just received.  A faultless 5-star experience.  The experience was similar when I ordered my wife's phone a few weeks ago.By comparison, I first started this journey by unsuccessfully trying to order from Three - I have left a review (via TP) regarding this experience which I begrudgingly gave a 1-star.Well done O2",2
"I would like to thank Rachel after my visit this morning. With patience, understanding and good humour, she assessed the various problems , untangled the chaos and handed me back a perfectly working phone.What an asset she is to the store, And I love the colour of her hair!!!!!!!",2
Great service all through lockdown.  Thankyou.  Also great competitions on O2 priority and thankyou for the free coffees much appreciated.,2
Been with O2 since 2010. Never had a problem. Good value and I like the way my phone agreement is separate from my airtime,2
02 are absolutely brilliant best network to be on upgraded my wife from sim plan to device plan when the device arrived it was damaged I rang o2 no problem they arranged for new device to be delivered next day to swap for damaged one excellent service 10 /10,2
"Many thanks to Rachel at the Bury O2 shop who helped me swop my SIM last Thursday.  A simple task for most people but for a ""senior citizen"" somewhat daunting.  She also took steps to enable me to keep my number.  Thanks again, Rachel!",2
"I have been very pleased with my service from the 02 shop in  Worthing, Tooting and Wandsworth.   BUT a cowboy in the 02 shop in Clapham Junction lost me 80 contacts and only managed to transfer 6.!!",2
"I've been with O2 for almost 9 years as a ""pay as you go"" customer and I'm really happy with their service. Their prices have always been very competitive, they have some fantastic offers (they only send me a text about them once in a while, no hassle at all), they also have a great rewards program, and their signal is very strong too (when I'm in some remote place, I often have better connection than my friends who have different mobile providers). I can totally recommend them.",2
Brilliant service all data rolls over verry nice customer service yeah just good service tbh.,2
"Mr Layke of Manchester and Ms Lisa Ray of South Africa office overseas thank you both for being very helpful and informative.O2 has a very good reception.Moreover; the Customer services are Polite, Professional, and Posh.I have been with O2 almost for 8 years by now, and also moved my existing number to O2 recently.",2
Fantastic customer service from Lindsay dealing with a fairly complex Phone issue. Very professional and restored our faith in O2.,2
"I have been wanting to upgrade my phone for a while. Customer services were calling while I was at work. I have finally managed to call in and get sorted. I spoke with a lovely lady, Holly (in Sheffield) who was super helpful, bubbly and definitely deserves recognition for her wonderful service today! Thanks Holly!",2
Just want to say a massive thank you to Anna on the upgrades team. She’s been an absolute star! After being with o2 for so many years and being passed around whole day trying to sort out my upgrade. She’s gone above and beyond for me and she truly deserves to be recognised for this. So thank you so much Anna!!,2
Online chat 30/08/2020Excellent service. Didnt have to queue and listen to music. Just type my question and away it went.   I messed up the password so Nikhil sent a code instead. I wanted to change my payment date which was done efficiently and within a few mins. Nikhil was polite and charming. This isnt the 1st time ive been on online chat. I do recommend it.,2
"I recently bought a sim card for a dongle for use on a laptop by a friend who was in hospital. I had problems trying to monitor the usage (so I could top it up) so called o2 Customer Services for advice. The first advisor I spoke to was not all synpathetic or helpful as no matter how many times I told him that the person using the card did not have a mobile phone, he continued to tell me to advise him to register with o2 so they could send him a a text with a code...so in total frustration I decided to call again and was connected to a different adviser called Charlotte. I made it clear that I was very close to tears and might either scream or cry.... she remained calm and listened to what I was telling her very carefully - and straight away was able to get to the bottom of the problem. She advised me that I had purchased the wrong kind of sim needed for use on a laptop and advised me that after a while it would stop working. Rather than making me feel stupid she simply asked for the adress where she could send a replacement sim which I gave her. The very next day the sim card arrived at my friends parents house and they were able to take it to the hospital for him to use. Not only that but she preloaded the card with credit to replace the credit that I had put on th eoriginal sim card....  this was a just a really fantastic happy end to a frustrating situation in which everyone involved was already under a lot of stress. Charlotte seemed to understand not just thge technical issue that needed reolving - but also had great empathy regarding the dilemma I was in. My faith in customer services was renewed - if only everyone could be trained by Charlotte! She made my day - I just wish I could send her some chocolates or flowers .",2
"Amazing service at the Eastleigh Swan Centre store. I was helped by a lovely lady yesterday who was helpful, polite and a pleasure to talk to really. I had walked in to talk about iPhone upgrades and walked out with a new iPad! Just goes to show how good she is at her job really, though I never felt pressured to buy and believe I walked out with a really great deal. Credit where credit is due and this woman deserves praise. If only I could deal with her every time I went to O2!",2
I recently had a phone call with one of the O2 representatives because I was paying a £40 monthly bill and my contract was coming to an end. I wanted to switch to a pay monthly contract and the lady on the phone was lovely and so helpful and got me on a £10 a month contract with everything I needed (and I got disney+ for free via O2!!) Thank you for making switching super easy!,2
"I am having financial issues due to COVID, unable to pay my costly bill. Julie from Payment management was able to rearrange everything for me and even helped me sort things out. I really appreciate her, she is an asset to O2.",2
Sat in store at the moment making an insurance claims staff have been extremely helpfull,2
O2 the best network in UK I’m customer with them over 9 years I never have any problem .,2
Been with o2 for years and see no reason for leaving. Reasonably priced for a great service.,2
"Been with for many years, no problem to report, guess I must be one of the lucky ones!",2
"called customer services as was having issues with a code i was sent for my upgrade. Spoke to a lovely lady called Eleanor who dealt with my issue and helped to find me the best quote! Left the call happy with the service she has provided and with a new upgrade on the way!I have spoken to some vile customer service people, I just wish a lot more of them had the patience and people skills as Eleanor and that way O2 would have a lot more happy customers!Thanks again and fingers crossed for Spain x",2
"So far not had a problem with O2, network coverage for me is excellent and at a decent price.I have had some poor network providers before (namely Virgin mobile and most recently EE) and so far O2 has been head and shoulders above them.Hopefully this will continue.",2
"I’ve been with Three for years, but sadly since the world Crisis Three has been shocking, switching and using O2 has been fab ( so far ) and the bonus of AppleTV+ and Disney+ was cool also!I’m hoping that the so far excellent service continues...",2
"Signed up for o2 over the weekend, received an email saying I needed to call in to confirm my order. Called and Instantly got put through to an advisor who was very friendly and helpful. Early days yet but I'm impressed by the level of service so far",2
Matthew from Burnley was really helpful on the phone. After being rejected twice and I re-applied and I was accepted for the Samsung Tablet TAB A 10.1. He explained things perfectly and went out of his way to assist me further. Absolutely polite on the phone and excellent customer services skills :),2
Always been happy as a customer with 02. They seem to give me a really good deal. Customer service team is pleasant. Thank you :-),2
I went to the 02 shop in Redcar ( teesside) Tommy was very polite and dealt with my enquiry without any chew. I left there very pleased nothing was a problem.,2
I would like to thank the staff at the Truro store (especially Luke) for all the help given to me yesterday in a difficult environment.Peter Jennings,2
"Just had a really positive experience with John from O2 technical support.  He was personable, supportive and went out of his way to help me. Gave me really good advice and resolved a sim issue.",2
Fabulous company and service provided.  Highly recommend.,2
"I am taking five minutes out of my day to thank O2 representative James Lohan for the courtesy and helpfulness he extended to me recently.Faced with a situation that I was unsure how to proceed with, James Lohan helped me through the process with a perfectly pleasant and professional manner.What I thought was going to be a somewhat difficult experience was made so much easier by this young man. No question was too absurd and never once was I left feeling overwhelmed with jargon I didn't understand.He has restored my faith in customer services and ensured that 02 has secured my business for the foreseeable future.Thank you againJames Lohan O2 Customer Services.19/05/20 13:18CASE ID :1199273032",2
I am an O2 customer for over 4 years i can say that i am happy with their service. I never had any reception problem like i had with Three. Just renewed my contract i toked  the samsung a90 5g for 30 months with 30 GB  and insurance for £53 a month,2
"My mum ordered a contract phone, was to be delivered today, she didn't realise she had signed up for a ""cashback"" phone, this meant the contract had risen from £23 to £37 per month, my mum wasn't understanding of this, and even though the fault was hers, we called 02 and spoke to AJ, he sorted the whole mess out for her and she now has a new phone at the price she wanted, big up to 02, massive up to AJ, and one happy oap 😊",2
"I've never had a problem with o2. I've been with them since I was 15 and I'm now 32. I moved to may monthly after being on pay as you go since I joined them. I get unlimited calls, texts and 100GD of data for £20 p/m. I've never had issues with my connection, signal quality or with the staff. Generally, I refuse to go with anyone else as I've been with Vodafone and Virgin before and they are terrible.",2
"Ordered a new sim only deal - came the next working day.Filled in online form with PAC code details - number ported within 24hrs.All up and running. As yet, no problems.",2
I always end up back with 02.  From the shops to customer service and ease of use much better than Tesco mobile anyway.,2
I told O2 I may have had Covid_19 but I was looking after my family and out of work due to the Coronavirus. They offered to put a hold on my account and leave my phone on so I could keep in touch with my family. I thought that was an amazing thing for them to do in already difficult times. I have been with O2 for a very long time (since bt cellnet) and don't see that changing any time soon. Thank you O2. I did end up paying but the offer was still good.,2
During a time like this in COVID-19 I wasn't expecting to be served at all or anyone to answer. After getting through the automated service I was put through to Adam who's service was perfect! I wanted an upgrade and wasn't sure on the best deal but Adam talked me through them all and made it clear to what I would be paying for and for how long as well as going through what works for me data wise and airtime. I've been with O2 for over 5 years and always gone through Carphone Warehouse and never really had thorough service like that so was very impressed with O2. I am now looking forward to my contract and upgrade as I'm fully aware of what I'm paying for as Adam dealt with everything and explained it to a T.,2
"I had a problem with my o2 pay as you go an am living abroad in oz. I normally have a contract in uk. I tried a few times to get through but due to covid had no luck so sent in an email to complaints an an o2 emplyee called Rachel was extremely helpful and answered my email, requested more info and then sorted my sim problem out. I am delighted with the customer service i received from o2 today. I have been with o2 for years and will continue.",2
"The longest I've spent with any network. They've been more than happy to renew me onto contracts priced even better than new customer deals when I've phoned up each year, and O2 Priority actually has some great benefits (that I didn't think I'd make any use of originally).",2
O2 /telefonica ukAfter upgrading my phone and taking out one of the o2 promotional deals with o2 buisness i never recived my Samsung watches (the promotion was free watches)after nearly 100days (was suppost to be delivered in 45days) i contacted samsung and the courier (fedex) myself without any luck.So i contacted the head office of o2/telefonica uk after just 3 days (including a weekend) problem solved could not have asked for a better response time or resolution.I am supprised to see so many bad reviews after the perfect and quick response i got.ThankyouMore than appreciated as this was a serious head ache for me,2
Love o2 all issues are solved and data is fast and great signal sometimes low in village area but overall really satisfied with the service way better than Vodafone or EE always quick and easy to resolve problems,2
"I am not a person who likes to leave reviews but today I have too.I was trying to upgrade my phone online but the website wasn’t allowing me to finish my order, so I decided to call o2, although the o2 msg said I would wait longer than usual, I was answered quite quickly, I got a very helpfull advicer I hope I got her name right Shuana, she was very patient, kind, and very sympathetic person, all I wanted was to finish my upgrade over the phone I wasn’t expected I could get any discount, but she volunteered to find something better for me, so she manage take £260 from my mobile phone device, I am so happy with my deal.I really can’t thank her enough, thank you Shuana.",2
Complaint about my bill dealt with within less than 24 hours. Really couldn't get better than that especially in time of COVID crisis.Absolutely fabulous,2
Great network. Always have coverage and had no problems at all whilst being with them.,2
I am a new customer2 weeks ago I got a new phone with o2 due to not having a credit history I had to pay a deposit of £425.00 which I did. One week later the county got turned on its head Covid 19 hit due to the issues with work and money I rang and asked if the £425 could be refunded without the loss of my service I seen that 02 supported my request and refunded this to my account outstanding service and support plus understanding thank you 02.,2
"I’m on pay as you go, received a text today giving me 300 free minutes to stay in touch with others during this tough time, I love this. It’s lovely to think they’re helping people who may be less fortunate and can’t talk to friends/family members through what’s going on. No other phone company I know of has done this",2
"I have had an O2 contract for two years,not once have I had a insufficient service.Good signal coverage, good response from customer service and the app works well to.My only gripe is hard sale that I got when I asked for a pac code.My contract was expiring and I found a better deal for the phone and package I required.That was the only reason for switching operators.",2
"Had a problem with handset purchased through third party. Wasn't O2's responsibility to resolve bit after the retailer refused to help they replaced the handset FOC and arranged delivery within 48 hours. Amazing service. Aisha was so understanding, only been with O2 for 3 months and felt like a valued customer.Please let Aisha know how pleased we were. Call was around 5:30 on Wednesday 24th March.",2
"Amazing service all round, thank you",2
Really good pay as you go service and really friendly,2
"Went to the O2 Huntingdon store and James the store leader helped us and I could not fault one thing! He was amazing!!!! After and awful experience with Carphone Warehouse, James made us feel at ease and helped us with every step he could. He is a true credit to O2 and when my phone contract expires I will be switching to O2!Amazing service!!",2
"I spoke to three agents today about cancelling my contract: Siliziwu, Nathan and Tracy. Siliziwu was pleasant to speak to and handled my query quickly and efficiently. Nathan was a star and really helped me know all options I had available during a really stressful and sticky situation and I really appreciated that help from him ; I wish our call wasn't disconnected. Tracy was so friendly and reassured me that everything was being actions etc. All three agents were brilliant and I'm so pleased with the service they provided.",2
"Never had one problem with there customer service, even when I've been really late paying my bill. Always very helpful",2
Fantastic data speeds and good package prices. Never had any calls drop out. Has UK call centres with staff that have a lot of knowledge about how to resolve problems. Comes with WiFi and 4G calling on sim only aswell.  No problems with O2.Worth the slightly higher price than Three as you can actually use the data you pay for.,2
"Good company, focus is the customer, reception is always good. Not cheap but fine, you get what you pay for.",2
"I have recently visited the O2 store in Southampton West Quay. As soon as I walked in it felt a good vibe and the staff all Friendly. I would like to give a shout out to Steve the advisor that helped me with a new contract and sim plan. He listened to everything I was saying and what I wanted from the plans and came up with a brilliant deal.In the past I had not had great experiences with the staff in the O2 stores even though I have been a customer for many years, however I would like to congratulate the Southampton store for restoring my faith in the company.Thank you again to Steve I will be recommending this store 😁",2
I was with O2 back than when they were called BT cellnet back in the day and EE was t mobile and one 2 one network .....But they offered me the best at the time ...now fast forward 20 years later and they are still here and improving as time goes by ...I think there customer service has been good to me so far plus they offered me the best Sim with alot of data for my money....Although at times they network does suffer from network loss but that's with all these networks nowadays depending on were Ur based....,2
I’ve spoke to a few 02 agents previously and liz was one of the most helpful along with another agent and they definitely exceeded in customer service. I thank them both for there help this morning.,2
"I wanted to personally thank Elorm in the O2 shop at 351 Oxford Street in London .Seamlessly assisted me in upgrading 2 Iphones  and the purchase of an apple watch.There was a discrepancy in the address on file which he painstakingly took charge of and rectified. Made the whole experience memorable and enjoyable . Also gave perfect advice and top quality customer service.A true professional in every sense.Carry on the great work Elorm .Kindest regards , Paul.",2
"I have smashed my phone, and after reading some reviews I was in doubts if they would help me, but no. I called and after 15 minutes talk everything was sorted and the very next day I have received the new phone trough DPD, and the smashed phone picked up. Phone insurance is not a waste of money after all.",2
I had an issue trying to upload a photo I had taken with my O2 iPhone (the file size was too large). I contacted the O2 helpline and Shadsha told me how to compress the file. Really good customer care. Many thanks.,2
"Been a customer for 15 years! I had my fair share of issues during that time as to be expected, but to be fair they always come through. Tried going off to the cheaper networks a few times but always came back promptly as none of the others are as well balanced. I get a largely hasslefree mobile life with O2 and that is all I want. I have found the best experience of O2 is to buy direct as whenever I got the 3rd party dealers involved, I always got cheated somehow - and I always but direct from one of their stores - the staff are usually great and the guru service if brilliant for any problems I have faced. Merry Christmas O2!",2
I was spoke with Daniel Davids 1995.very nice polite and funny Guy. explain me all i want 2 know.5☆,2
"Had a dispute over a bill which I did not think I should pay.  Having spoken to Lauren at 02 I was delighted that the matter was fully resolved to my satisfaction.  Well done Lauren and 02, excellent customer service",2
Fantastic customer service! All staff I spoke to had a good knowledge and were able to help me! They were patient when it came to making decisions! They listened to what I wanted rather than trying to sell me something of more value! Can’t fault them at all!,2
"My contract is finished so was going to leave and get a sim deal only because of price.received pac number and decided to  ring 02 to see if they could match a good deal I saw,which they did. Sheila In customer services was very helpful and explained how to change over from one phone to another,which I already bought,Phone up and running couldn’t ask for more.",2
"I realise there are not may good reviews on here because I guess most relate to handset/contract/broadband issues but as I only used the O2 shop I am only giving a review for that.  Ordered a bluetooth speaker, which was the cheapest price on the internet, it came with free delivery, it arrived by courier the next day.  Extremely good service in my opinion.  Shame all the other departments don't get the same views.  Well done O2 shop!!",2
"Absolutely brilliant company!! The my 02 app is so easy to check your upcoming bill and offers. Very clear on what you owe and next month bill . I have been with a lot of mobile companies and been so disappointed . 02 launched the very first iPhone in Britain, first touch screen!! I got one for my Christmas from my partner . He’s been with 02 ever since. They don’t bombard you with emails and texts. Definitely check 02 !!",2
"I appreciate many people come on here to complain about the service of O2 but I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the excellent customer service I received from Joseph Ncanyawa in helping me with my account earlier this month 9/11/19.It is the first time dealing with O2, that I have felt the need to write to knowledge a member of their customer service team and that is down to Joesph.If you are lucky to speak to him...I am sure like me you will appreciate it afterwardsWell done Joseph...keep up the good work!",2
"HEATHER from Maidenhead store was absolutely brilliant !Switched from Samsung to Huawei and she completely took the strain out of it.Helpful, cool and successful. A credit to 02.Thanks again,Paul",2
"I think O2 is brilliant! I have been on O2 for quite a few years now and I have never had any problems neither with the network, neither with billing. In fact, I had a big problem to solve with my new mobile bought from ""Affordable mobiles""(never again!!!) and O2 guys at Horwich Middlebrook centre did everything and more to solve my problem. All of them! Thank you so much to all those young men who has so much patience with us older people who do not understand new technology very well. Great team, great network!Vilija",2
"Excellent customer service, Peterborough Thanks Jamie",2
Purchased new 100GB SIM contract.SIM arrived on next day.They have transferred my number from giffgaff in no time.Brilliant service so far.,2
"Surprised that O2 have such a low rating on Trust Pilot. Many years ago, I used to us O2 all the time right up until I had my first contract with Vodafone (that's a company you need to avoid like the plague) and after rubbish signal, I moved to EE. Move to a new house and my signal with EE was shocking and was in an ongoing dispute with them for months. They eventually cancelled my contract and I took out my first O2 phone contract.Fantastic signal in the area that I live. Fantastic customer service who are always on hand to help, whether that be in store or online. Great deals.But what really ripped the scales for me is that earlier in the month, they had a promotion where they pay off contracts so you can upgrade to O2 refresh. I ended up with a brand new phone, still maintaining a fantastic service and signal and can change my phone whenever I want (within reason of course).Genuinely have no complaints and I hope that I continue to have all the more reason to keep using them.",2
"i would like to give a review about the staff of the 02shop, market st branch, manchester.They are the nicest most helpful staff iv’e ever dealt with in particular Lisa. She is one of the most efficient and helpful members of staff who gives 100% to the customer, she is a delight to deal with and takes time to explain to a technophobe such as myself, the easiest way round the latest smartphone and making it so much easier for me to understand all the technical jargon. She obviously knows what she’s talking about and is so patient n helpful she is an absolute asset to the 02 company.From a very satisfied customer Mrs B",2
As I work in customer service my self I only want the professionalism which I give my self. I spoke to an Adam Taylor in Payment Management based in Warrington. The quality and assurance    I was given from this agent was amazing. He went above and beyond to help me to his best ability. I hope his team leader and manger see this as he is a asset to the company. I wish that many other o2 agents are like Adam. Thanks Adam!!,2
"Have had problems with my pay and go. I contacted O2 and they have taken the matter seriously, contacted me several times by phone and messenger and have shown an interest in solving the problem.",2
Went in Chatham o2 store on 22/09/2019 to fix an issue with my mother's Pay and Go tariff. o2 representative Mya was very friendly and approachable. She has done all in her power to help us with our issue and even called to o2 customer service for us twice. She stood for our case until the end. We are very pleased with helpful service and highly recommend to visit this store.,2
"Was on the verge of moving my business account but had the most professional, courteous, friendly and efficient call with Martin Loughnave who was so helpful I decided to stay. Hope 02 can recognise him for his professionalism.",2
"Fraud took place on my account. Called O2 who first asked me to email the fraud company and speak to them directly. O2 asked to call them back if I had any issues. Two days later after speaking with this fraudulent company ""remote games"" I called O2 and spoke to Leonie. She was a brilliant help and was able to get these charges refunded by a good will gesture. Thanks O2 and Leonie for the quick resolution.",2
The customer service is truly the best... couldn't fault it quick and accurate service... such friendly people and always find a way to help.,2
"Always had a great experience with O2, always helpful on chat and happy to assist.",2
"I ordered a phone via the my o2 app as I was due an upgrade. It was meant to be next day delivery but after 3 day of waiting and my new phone not arriving I decided to phone the o2 customer services. An agen called Shannon answered, she mentioned that that on her system it shows the phone was delivered the next day, obviously I havent recieved it so she contacted the couriers. They hadnt a clue where the phone was and had to perform a driver review. All of this happened over a couple of hours and Shannon made certain I didnt speak to another advisor which meant I didnt have to constantle explain my situation. She was so lovely and constantly apologised for this issue which is not her nor o2's fault. My phone was delivered to my neighbour but no card was posted to let me know. I now have my phone and I am very thankful for all of Shannons help.",2
"I visited the o2 store in Wood Green and would like to thank Adrian for his very honest and informative customer service. He was very polite, helpful and far from pushy (which you can often get from a sales rep). He knew his stuff, explained things clearly, was completely transparent - made my customer experience a productive one so thank you once again.",2
"Visited O2 in Livingston Almondvale shop today with my Mum and was very impressed with Fiona, who was extremely helpful and ever so patient and informative. Excellent service provided by this member of staff.",2
"Have been a costumer for a right few years. Outstanding company. Network and coverage is second to none, great customer service, Always have gone the extra mile for me. It’s nice to use a company that makes you feel like your needs come first.",2
"In honestly I like O2 and the issues that I have had were resolved quickly and with little fuss. Over the years I’ve been a customer of all of the telecommunications companies and really only 02 have been worth while using and certainly the best company too use.I’m sure like most companies nowadays, there is moments when service is bad but I haven’t experienced this from 02 yet and hopefully I won’t.I’d recommend o2 and give 9/10*Tip* If your having trouble with your phone try contacting the manufacturer as well (Apple/Samsung etc) quite often they will just replace/repair  the handset without  all the hassle.",2
"My experience with O2 so far been great. I use a pay as you go sim, and it is the international version. I can ring EU for couple of pence a minute, which is great. I can also enjoy a free hot drink from Cafe Nero on a Tuesday or Wednesday and loads of other discounts with the Priority app.  Keep up the good work, O2!",2
Couldn't do enough for me when I received my handset and were great with setting up my phone for me.,2
"Excellent service yet again. You may need to wait a little while to be served, but it's always worth it. The customer service at Eastbourne O2 is amazing. Today,  however, it was better than ever! Thank you Kyle for all your help with choosing my new phone, and with transferring everything over. You really went above and beyond, and you're a credit to O2. No pushy sales tactics, just brilliant, old fashioned good customer service.  Thank you",2
Never had a problem with 02 been with them for about 6 years and every time I have a issue with paying the bill they are always so helpful. I could not fault them.,2
I upgraded my phone recently and the staff in the UK call centre found me a great deal and were really helpful.  I picked the phone up from a store where admittedly the staff weren't that bothered unless I bought something.  They told me to go to 134 Oxford Street to see if there was a guru there who could help me get it up and running as I'm not great with new technology.  I had tried to book a guru in advance but none were available and my home internet and landline had gone down so I couldn't get help that way.  I'm having medical treatment and need to be connected to the outside world.  The staff at 134 Oxford Street were lovely and more than made up for the other store. Even though no guru was available Tenzin kindly got the phone going and showed me how to use it.  I'm delighted with my phone and am very grateful for that store's amazing customer service.  I finally managed to book a guru to learn more about how my phone works and Danny in the Brixton store was very knowledgeable.,2
"I am on o2 pay as you go. Through my own fault my sim was blocked, the call center in South Africa was very friendly and restored my sim number as well as restoring the original ballance. I live in SA do not speak Africaans but the advisor spoke perfect English. As long as you get good service it does not have to be in the UK",2
"I’ve been from o2 for approx 4 months now, after moving from awful Vodafone. So far so good. The cost is reasonable, priority benefit and customer service is good.I like the fact that I can put a bar on my account and have add-on. I also receive warnings when I’m close to using up my data and calls allowance",2
"I cannot fault o2. I asked if I could send a Huawei GT watch back that I bought 5 weeks ago due to developing an allergic reaction to something in the watch and they were more then happy to either refund me or exchange it for something else to which I choose a fitbit versa. Thankyou o2, a lot better then my previous network",2
Excellent customer service. I had some problems with extra charges on my bill and phoned to query them. The customer service advisor (sadly forgot his name) was extremely helpful.He took the time to figure out what happened. Asked me if I was ok to wait to get his manager to look at it and then he told me that they could get back the charges. He also sat and calculated the correct amount including the VAT so that I would get every penny that was taken by accident.Very polite and reassuring over the phone and even wished me a good weekend. 10/10,2
"I contacted o2 via the live chat to query an upgrade .. I have a sim only plan so just wanted to add a device plan to this. The advisors on live chat couldn’t help me in anyway! To the point where I said no bother, I will leave and go back to three. They just accepted this and I closed the chat. I called 202 just to quickly discuss if there were any options and spoke to a lovely advisor called Craig. He was wonderful and upgraded my phone with no problems at all. The 5 star review is for Craig. Don’t use live chat it’s far too robotic!!",2
"Id like to thank the welcome security guys especially John who was so kind and went out of his way to provide us with a wheelchair to get our father to our destination, it helped to make our mother and fathers anniversary a bit more special, and he did it in his own time.",2
"I have been with o2 for 20 years. I had a great experience so far. Nothing to complain about at all.The prices are fair for what I get and they don't surprise you with out of the blue big price raises when your deal expire... I tried Virgin and Vodaphone, which were ok but Virgin kept hiking the prices up + you have to deal with loads of third parties; and vodaphone had intermittent connection at the time.O2 so far so good!",2
"Great customer service at O2 Harrow store. Haifa at O2 Harrow store was amazing. She helped me with setting up a 40gb data plan. She was awesome, quick, and very polite. Just great experience overall and fast network.",2

Stephanie explained everything step by step and was absolutely lovely and amazing would recommend her to anyone without thinking great service and approach to the customer deserves a pay rise. Thank you for great experience Stephanie,2
"I've been with O2 ten years or more. On Saturday 4 May 2019 i phoned O2 to upgrade 2 phones and 2 tablets. Paul answered the pnone almost straight away.  From the start he was extremely polite, helpful and friendly in a professioal way.  I told him what I wanted and he led me through the procedure. As I was upgrading 4 devices it took a little while and was a bit repetitive however Paul remained upbeat and attentive throughout. He made sure he understood my needs and that I understood every stage. I must emphasise Paul was extremely clear in his pronunciations which helped me understand every aspect. He made me smile throughout the whole call and I came away very happy. Thank you Paul you are a real asset to O2!",2
Spoke with Emily on the phone about my Grandads phone bill and she was absolutely fantastic! She upgraded his contract to unlimited calls free of charge. He is house bound and this really helps him as he gets lonely so makes allot of calls. If I could give more stars I would! Thank you Emily,2

"Been an O2 consumer/business customer for around 20 years, while we've had our fair share of problems over the years, they've always looked after me.  Had no issues when travelling to different countries.  Customer Services are good and coverage is excellent.",2
The only mobile phone network worth paying for.,2
"Extremely impressed with O2 customer service. I emailed about a small issue with regard to international data charges and was called back the next day by a very helpful agent who was able to resolve my issue within a couple of minutes. I do not usually write reviews, but was compelled to do so on this occasion as my previous experience of telephone companies is that customer service is a nightmare. Quite the opposite with O2. I am relatively new to O2, and will most definitely stay with them when customer service is of this high quality. Thank you to the agent I spoke to!",2
"I recently joined 02 and it is the best network I've ever been on, having tried Vodaphone and Virgin over the years.No issues with signal or the internet at all. Plus fantastic rewards on priority and money back on my spend so I'm quids in. Free Cafe Nero coffee, easter eggs, Thornton's mother's day chocs fantastic!",2

Two weeks ago I bought a new phone from the o2 shop in Halifax which for me is quite a daunting task but I was looked after by a young lady called Emma and she made it a joy she was very knowledgeable and friendly she transferred everything I needed from my old phone to the new one and I was up running in no time. I would like to give my thanks to Emma and the O2 team in Halifax,2

I must give 5 star to a kind lady called JADE she really show how professional she is ..I been having problems with o2 for a month now...but hopefully is resolved Jade thank you for you patience a kindness and your attitude made me calm and  I realized that Some people who work in costumer services at the o2 They need to learn loads with you thank you 🙏 I wish I could give u ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Never had any issues, been with them for years.",2
I don’t work for o2 I am a genuine customerBut I have had nothing but excellent customer service.I called them today as my payment was gonna be late they did a promise to pay for 10 days advised there would be a £3.50 late payment charge totally ok it is my fault.They understood my predicament and reassured me everything was ok. Fantastic 5 stars from meThank you o2,2
"I’ve been with o2 many years on pay and go never had a problem, I don’t think I’d use any other network",2
Twelve years with O2Never had a problemTariffs clear and service pretty goodThe only downside is roaming is not cheap outside the tourist areas!,2
"Ok, well My Son had had a text message that said ""thanks for subscribing to jamjar, £4.50 will be debited from your account every fortnight"" or something to that effect. My Son was confused and he said he had not subscribed to any one nor clicked on any links, hes a bright lad at university doing business studies and is very good with money and things like this so i knew he was telling the truth. i contacted o2 fraud team and the first person said we had to reply STOP to the number then ring a number that he gave me. My Son had deleted the text message knowing this was a scam and so we couldnt reply STOP to it, we tried the number and 3 loud beeps then dead, i though we had been told the wrong info from o2 so i rang again and what a great guy that sorted us, his name is Mohammed (Magic Mo) and he immediately refunded me the money, put a block on anymore coming through and also personally rang the company for me whilst i was on hold, sure enough i got text messages from o2 confirming all what he said. Not only did he help us he was really funny guy who made us both feel at ease and also made us smile, thanks MAGIC MO, you really are an inspiration to customer services. We need more like you. I really hope that this message gets back to him because these kind of people need to know they are doing a fantastic job. Thank you",2
"Kris in re-contracts was awesome, he made my decision very easy and was a pleasure to speak to, please make sure he gets this review.",2
My partner and i have been with O2 for quite some time now and have had little to no real issues. But i just wanted to say how incredibly helpful the staff in the Northfield store are! Pardeep was an absolute delight to sit with and he helped us with everything we needed in store and was really friendly.. he is a credit to the store!,2
Zara from Birms New Street is absolutelty amazing. Helped me with my upgrade,2
Got accepted the 9th June 2018 received the next day. I added another phone the 5th January and delivery the next day. Such an easy process. The customer service is excellent always helpful.,2
"Best phone company I used,  sends back cash rewards for topping up, cheap rates for the occasional user.  Sends out free sim cards to the UK.  If you lose your phone convenient to get your old number back.",2
Donna in the O2 Store in High Street Exeter was extremely helpful and fast in getting me sorted with my new Sony. Thanks Donna.,2
O2 Aylesbury has been an excellent when it comes to customer service. They made to a point that their customer will be satisfied and completely happy of their service. That is why I have been with O2 for more than 10 years because of their high standard which is excellent. Thanks to Jake who has been brilliant and very professional and so ever been so patient with us. O2 is highly recommended!!!,2
"Have recently subscribed to O2 Classic 3-2-1 PAYG scheme.  As you can tell it's pay as you go and you pay 3p for calls, 2p for texts and 1p per gig of internet.I now have two phones on this scheme and have to say it's fine. The rates are the same as that charged by 'Three' but, for me, the coverage seems better than Three. Also the O2 customer service has been absolutely superb.  They are based in South Africa - I have to say they have answered the phone quicker than anyone else .... (although I admit Asda Pay As You Go service was excellent too) ...and the O2 advisors have been great and were very polite, helpful and well informed. The PAC transfer from Asda to O2 was successful on both occasions. Obviously the other reviews reflect differing views but I can only speak as I find.",2
Flush the customer services fantatic well done,2
Very very happy with my experience from O2 customer services! Can’t thank them enough for their help,2
"Despite all the disruption in the last couple of days, the company have been absolutely fantastic over the years. I have had various company phones with other servers and I can't begin to tell you the comparison for me is obvious.I won't be switching any time soon. Thanks everyone at o2.",2
Have helped me when late business payers have not paid on time. They have no tied a rope over my connection like other provider stories I have heard.This problem is an equipment supplier upgrade issue not 02. It happens with office equipment.,2
Great service in o2 shop when setting up new sim,2
"Switched over from EE, had a good experience with o2 so far.",2
Thank you to Janice for all your help finally SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT SHES DOING!!!!! Unlike the previous person I spoke to that was arguing with my saying I was going to be charged £97 to change my direct debit dateMASSIVE SHOUT OUT TO JANICE!!!!,2
"O2 have been continously fantastic looking after me as a customer for over 15 years,I've had the phone for many years and also I had their broadband at one point (only reason I no longer do is because they sold to Sky) however they have always solved problems, give credit when needed (even at times when I have accidentally gone over minutes and not realised they've credited) so honestly, they're one of the best companies within the UK by far!",2
"We bought a new phone and an 02 contract via a reseller. It has all worked out well, so far.Looking at previous reviews for this company, as well as other mobile service providers, it would appear that there's much these companies can do to make our lives better and improve their procedures.More power to Ofcom to act, for starters and more competition.",2
"What's with the bad reviews? I have been with 02 for years, great company, no issues at all!! I give them 5 stars..",2
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I have just upgraded my phone with them. I was able to do it online, no trouble at all. Got the tariff I wanted, and sorted out my insurance. I ordered my new phone on a Tuesday morning, I had by lunchtime the next day. The delivery driver gave me an hour slot between 12-1 for delivery, so I didn't have to wait around all day. Very impressed with the service. That's why I've stuck with them.",2
"O2 has Brilliant Customer Service.Every time I need to check or change something on my account I just chat with them online, friendly staff, very helpful, always will give you the best tariff, will do some discounts.Nice Quick and EasyI wish  that other companies had the same Customer service",2
"I had a problem with my account, I phoned customer services,The lady that I spoke to was most helpful and explained what I was doing wrong, she has set me up with a new o2 Bundle as the one I had was dated,  o2 customer services have always listened and acted positively when I have phoned them, an excellent service,",2
"When starting a new O2 contract it's best to block all Direct bills to mobile, Premium bar and International Bar to start, you can always remove the bars later by calling customer service. On new contract or upgrade from 1 October 2018 you can now set a Spend cap at £0 to protect you from unexpected bills as you can always change this by calling customer service or MyO2 App. Most people on this form don't quite understand what a contract means. You are agreeing to pay them a monthly charge for 1 or 2 years plus any extras charges which you must pay on time. If you cannot guarantee you can afford it for the year(s) don't sign up use pay as you go no excuses please. Look after your phone and insure it, 2 years is a long time paying for something you have broken or had it stolen. I have used O2 (Cellnet), Vodafone, EE (One2One, T-Mobile & Orange), Tesco, Virgin and Three for over 32 years and I find now it's easier to buy my phone outright and look for the SIM only deals. It's so easy to change network with a PAC code and your number changes over the next working day and automatically cancels your existing contract.",2
"Best service I've ever had from a mobile phone store. I'd been with EE for years, but found the staff in that store unhelpful and unwilling to fix anything unless it meant selling you something new; the OPPOSITE with O2. After not having any success with EE I went into their store on Chapel Street, Southport, and they were willing to help me without the hard sell. I didn't commit that day, but went back and since then have had amazing help from Anna, Ken and Jo, who are always so friendly and willing to go out of their way for you. Prices better than EE, their knowledge and expertise far exceeds the competition, there's never that awful wait time that makes you reluctant to even go into a mobile phone store for help, so overall, a complete winner for me! I purchased their own brand ""1+"" phone- was going to go for the S9 and really was looking for a great camera, but the 1+ was the winner. Am delighted with my phone!",2
"Good Company with practical prices on iPhones which I was looking for will be returning for a new contract.I have just recently moved from EE and their greedy antics for new iPhones is just vulgar.£80+ for new iPhone and 3 gb of data what use is that to anyone when EE and most sites such you towards the internet they forget that when they offer overpriced contracts and dish out 3gb of data its obscene and they should be ashamed of themselves.O2 have been nothin but helpful 50gb of data, free calls, free texts best that EE.",2
"After dropping my s8+ i decided to claim on my insurance, i have to admit 02 where brilliant. They asked a few questions over the phone, arranged to collect it next day then confimed a day later they had recieved it. Just a few hours later i recived an email to confirm i would have a new phone the next day! Super fast service and great customer service. Thanks 02",2
"I am continually surprised with the efficiency of O2 Customer Service and also their Insure team so would like to extend my thanks to them. My phone got stolen on Saturday for the second time in a year and they were just absolutely brilliant at resolving it extremely quickly. Everyone I spoke to on the phone were kind, compassionate and sorted it at incredible speed.Yes, I do find O2 average in terms of price; however, I honestly think it is worth it because with other companies the customer service lacks where it absolutely should be. For these reasons I've been with o2 for 10 years and will continue to be with them. Thank you O2.",2
"I've been with o2 since the first iPhone and think they offer a fantastic service.Recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max, was due to upgrade in November, but o2 offered to cancel the remaining £70 left on my current phone contract and upgraded me early.Phoned customer services to check some details on my order and the lady I spoke to was really helpful.I also needed a new SIM card for a PAYG number I have. I used LiveChat for this, and the agent was great. Got my SIM card and I am really pleased!Thanks o2!",2
"Been with o2 for many years and like the way they do things which is simple and start forward,have renewed with them again just last week.Can not fault them they are helpful when u need them when things go wrong or to check what the fault is in my area.Always looking to improve the service.",2
"The service I received in the Carmarthen branch today was excellent.  The two chaps were friendly,knowledgeable and polite. An absolute credit to your company.  Good people are hard to come by. Whatever you do, don't let them leave. I've already recommend that branch to several colleagues.Many thanks.Alice",2
"I decided finally to give my ancient iPhone 4S heave ho with something a bit more up to date. I could do so and get more minutes on my contract and yet still pay less per month than I was with my 4S (silly me for sticking with it for so long). Nonetheless this did require my number to be transferred to a new SIM which, mercifully O2 did for me without complication or delay. Just to wrap up, I ordered my replacement phone at 18:00 on Wednesday, it arrived with me at 16:00 on Thursday - now that's efficiency. In all my years with O2, they've seldom let me down and I would not hesitate in recommending them to anyone.",2
Love my iPhone X on my upgrade. Good deal!!,2
"Absolutely lovely experience ! Called up to ask to pay for my bill later on , received top service and got it all sorted.  I work in customer service myself and I hope I'll get to speak like that on the phone one day ! Thank you Matt from Customer Service !!!",2
"Good prices, good service via chat, FB & 202, Priority & O2 app are fun, no dodgy bills. Best of big 4 for contract & paygo. Only network that does internal number migration too.",2
"I've been with O2 going on a decade, and I have to say, it's unlikely that I will go anywhere else while they're around. I've never had any issues with signal, or customer service, their insurers have always sorted me out quickly and without any hassle (And I break A LOT of phones!) and my upgrades have always been easy.I also LOVE the O2 Priority benefits. I use them constantly for ticket purchases, and meals out - their offers are always attractive and relevant to me. It's a real draw to being with O2.",2
"Been with O2 for many years and got to say - think they are great.  Reinforced today when I moved my daughter's account over.  She had been with Three - shocking/awful customer service.  Phoned O2 about a bolt on which I had unwittingly signed up to with UNICEF, they sorted it instantly.  Three.... I was passed round 3 different people, insincere service, shabby.  Glad the family are all now with O2",2
Just taken out another contract with O2.They always provide good network coverage and the 02 rewards system is a nice bonus.,2
"After a crisis involving much confusion and distress, O2 came out on top. Immediate replacement of Sims, advice, updates and support. O2 White Rose, Leeds, staffed exceptionally. Especially Sam. Up and beyond the call of duty, patience in abundance, calm, friendly and above all professional and no pressures.",2
Jody from the billing department has helped me out a lot and gave extremely good customer service.Friendly!Listens to you!And also treats you as a person rather than an opportunity.Lovely staff member you have here named Jody! 10/10!!!!,2
Great company with a fantastic rewards scheme. Staff in shops are friendly and the tariffs are compative.,2
"I have a periodic problem with O2 that means occasionally some contacts can't ring or text me even though I can ring and text them. No one at O2 has ever been able to get to the bottom of it and indeed liked to shrug off responsibility and pass the buck to the other networks. HOWEVER, yesterday at Surrey Quays branch, lovely Naz was determined to get to the bottom of it and, with the help of the Network tech team, solved it! I'm ever so grateful to Naz and think he deserves 10 stars! Turns out a network upgrade (I think) has the effect of no longer recognising numbers originally ported from other providers. It's as if the network thinks the numbers are no longer in use.",2
I had managed to drop my phone Have been with 02 for years Decided to visit the 02 shop on the Parade in Leamington Spa Warwickshire Dina the assistant there could not have been more helpful. MyOriginal phone was beyond saving but gave me good advice and sorted new one with no problem When my contract is due. I will visit the shop rather than use on line. Thanks againVaughan,2
"Every single time I've gone into O2 over the last few years the Gurus have been so helpful, kind and patient.Simply wonderful customer service in my opinion",2
I’ve been a happy customer with O2 for a number of years. I generally get a decent network connection and I feel I’ve got a great tarrif price.,2
I’ve been with these guys for the longest. Deal with issues pronto.,2
"Had to close some accounts for my husband but due to his poor English it was a struggle to talk to them as they wouldn’t speak to me but my husband even when we went into the branch they told us to call again.I called yesterday and I spoke to Zola and he was so kind and helpful. He spoke to me throughout the call so I could translate to my husband and he asked some security questions which I did then have to pass the phone onto my husband and tbh having done that before they would always say that my husband needed to speak but they always failed to understand him . Zola helped us with our enquiry and then transferred us to Sadam who also was so kind and helpful because of Zola and Sadam I don’t think we would have got our things done! Sadam was very nice and explained promptly to us and answered all our enquiries . He would put us on hold to actually go and get the right info ! He even advised us to recycle our old phone.I only gave o2 5* because of Zola and Sadam, or else I tbh had worse experience with o2!I was so admired by their time and effort and their service I honestly never write reviews but I was treated so well that I couldn’t resist!They were so patient and dealt so well with usI wasn’t sure about their names as I only got to ask one of them but today I received a text regarding the service and now I have their names and tbh they need a pay rise ASAP! Even a promotion😜Because no one has ever taken that much effort into work like them ... most of o2 customer service only want to get rid of you ASAP and end your call -_-",2
The best car insurance I ever had.Cost-effective solutions and direct client approach.Flexible and cheapI could never have thought that a telephonic brand could have offered this massive service.Very good Job,2
"Went in to the spindles store in Oldham town centre and was seen by Mark. He was knowledgeable, helpful and an all round nice guy that gave honest advice and helped me find the right deal. Working in retail myself, I understand the importance of returning customers and it’s safe to say next time I need a phone I’ll be returning due to marks excellent customer service👍👍",2
On Monday I need to contact O2 to get three number changed two new numbers I spoke to a lady called Sally in South Africa she was first class and provided me with everything that I needed I was wowed I'd like O2 if they read this to pass on my thanks for a job well done JP,2
The best customer service out there bar none. Friendly knowledgable staff who are clearly striving to make a difference. Have never had a bad customer experience in the last 7 years. Stands out as Vodafone previously were dreadful dreadful dreadful.,2
noticed so many bad reviews so thought id chip in. Been with o2 for over 10 years. Never any issues. Very happy still. Sometimes people only write reviews when they've got a rant :),2
Lovely customer service. Made EE seem even worse which I didn't think was possible!Very easy to get hold of someone on instant chat if you have a problem. Always desperate to help you- I had a technical issue that was fixed straight away. I was apologised to for the error.I've also been mad to feel like being loyal customer actually means something to o2. o2 priority is an added bonus that rewards customers. I've also had the best reception since I switched from EE. I frequently went without service until I switched o2!,2
"Great service - whenever I have an issue they really work hard to solve it. I moved away from o2 because I found a rolling monthly contract elsewhere cheaper, but after 2 months I came back - can’t fsult the service.",2
"Great customer service received from ELROY- customer advisor at O2! Very professional, helpful and proactive guy! Thanks for sorting out my case! Would definitely stay with O2  😊",2
"Ok I can see there is a tone of bad reviews here but I honestly love 02 I haven’t had one single problem with them, I never loose connection, there’s 02 refresh which is extremely handy, there’s so many good points to 02. I was with Vodafone for a long time and they were a extremely poor company compared to 02 so 5* I know this may seem or appear like a joke review considering all the bad remarks against 02 on here but it’s a honest genuine opinion from my experience with them.",2
"I've been a customer for probably 10 years or so now - and never, ever had a single problem. For a telecoms company I think this is pretty good. Thank you for all your excellent service over the years.",2
Just spoke to Matthew on live chat and he went above and beyond to help me. Fab service. Makes a pleasant change. Thank you Matthew,2
"Upgraded my phone online yesterday and had realised once it had been dispatched that I had ordered a 32gb instead of a 128gb, once the phone was delivered this afternoon I took it to my local o2 store (west quay Southampton) still completely sealed where I was greeted by a man leaning on a counter who couldn’t of cared any less about what I had to say and told me there was nothing he could do and sent me on my way, I then thought I would try my luck in the o2 shop 2 minutes away the above bar Southampton store where one of your employees was so helpful and said he was unsure on whether he could help because it had been purchased online but asked us to take a seat whilst he went to find out what he could do, a man named Ben then came over and said he would need to contact someone to see if it was possible, which he then found out it was, he then started the process, he was very friendly, had a laugh, recommended some apps and sent me on my way with the phone I had wanted all along, had it not of been for Ben today my score would of been 1 star! Although it was my fault for ordering the wrong phone and had Ben of found out he couldn’t help I would of appreciated his efforts anyway! But I’m very pleased with my new phone! Thanks Ben!",2
Great customer service. Never had a problem with them across my several devices and years with them. Much better than EE and Vodafone who I’ve been with in the past,2
The best network provider. After a rubbish 6 months with another provider was so pleased to be able to have 3&4g on my mobile. I love 02 and have had to increase my data due to being able to use it in my area,2
Poor customer service. Issue still remains. Will be cancelling direct debit until it is sorted and at end of contract will not be with o2.I have amended this review because O2 have addressed all of my concerns and I continue to be a customer. I have even taken out car insurance with them.,2
"Seem's to be some real hating on O2, which to be honest surprises me...maybe more to do with the fact people are more likely to share bad experiences perhaps?Personally I've had nothing but good for all the years I have been with them. coverage is spot on, service is great, perks are fantastic (love my free coffees and early gig ticket sales). Also love how O2 where the first of the main networks in the UK to split out the phone and network costs making upgrading easier. Also made roaming abroad not cost the earth and will be part of standard usage in 2018.So yeah, feel this positive review might be just a drop in the ocean of bad  ones but hey, there are some of us who are happy with 02 :)",2
Excellent customer service from Michael in the Manchester call center! 🙂,2
Just great. I moved from Vodafone 12 months ago as they had become truly shocking. I've O2 to be a breath of freshair. The help instore is great. The network is more reliable that Vodafone's and with better coverage in my experience. 12+ months in they've just called me to pro-active offer to reduce my price for the same sim only bundle! Brilliant.,2
"I have been a user of O2. Mobile for well over 20 years. They have nearly always been fast, efficient and trouble free. The one time I complained they were fast, efficient and friendly at responding to my complaint and went out of their way to help, resolving the issues almost immediately. Unlike most companies these days they responded and resolved the problem and apologised for the inconvenience not within months, weeks, days or even hours. But within minutes. Yes minutes. And it was resolved by a section manageress, showing that they took the complaint seriously and cared about their customers. Faultless service from O2 customer services and faultless service from O2 ever since. One of the few companies that I would not hesitate in recommending, and as far as pay as you go is concerned, one of the best.",2
"I absolutely love being an 02 customer! They are efficient and helpful in every respect. I receive great 02priority treats every week for being a customer, and they go out of their way to keep my bills as low as possible. I am also always up to date with the latest handset.",2
"Called in the 02 shop at the Deppdale Centre, Preston this morning.I just needed a new SIM for an iPhone I didn't buy from 02.Really good, prompt and very friendly service.  A credit to 02.",2
O2 are the best phone network that I have ever been with. Excellent customer service,2
"Been with O2 ever since they took over BT Cellnet (20 years?).  Wonderful, very friendly and helpful staff. If there is ever a problem, it's sorted quickly and efficiently. Always received the right advice on new handsets and deals. The best network around! 😀",2
"I have been a customer with o2 for years and never had any issues. I fancied and early upgrade so I used their live chat function today to see if I could arrange this.I ended up speaking with a manager and got a great deal on a new handset.Overall, very happy with o2 and the service they provide.",2
"Visited O2 shop at Westwood Cross today. We were apologised to firstly as they were extremely busy. However, after only a few minutes we were attended to by a young man who I believe was David Saunders, he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, he certainly knew what he was talking about. We came away with better terrific than we had had previously and my husband's new phone was up and running in no time. Thank you David for your personal service today.",2
Just had a very good experience with o2 customer service. They supplied me with a like-for-like temporary replacement phone and credited me a month's bill due to an on-going very poor experience with customer service at Huawei who have had my phone in for repair for almost five weeks.I should have given my phone to o2 for repair but I stupidly contacted the manufacturer directly - last time I make that mistake.,2
Been with O2 for 3 months now on a SIM only deal. Extremely happy with network coverage and internet speeds in West London. So far didn't need to call Customer Service for anything major... Glad I left the other network for O2.I tried all the big mobile phone players... O2 is on top of the list.,2
My boyfriend really needed a new phone and contract and after being turned down by EE was getting worried he wouldn't be getting one however Olivia in the west quay Southampton branch was super helpful was able to a great phone and contract for a good monthly price! Very happy with her service!,2
"Amazing service from O2.  My daughters phone was stolen on Sunday night. Visited the Notting hill store on Monday am. They helped us get a crime number on line, reordered the phone, the replacement phone came the very next morning before 10am.  Great service from staff. Well done",2
I used O2 chat today to get my previous phone unlocked. Customer service was top notch from Kevin.  Thank you O2 you did a great job today,2
I've just come back to O2 with a sim only pay as you go after spending 2 years with another network never having a signal indoors.The main reason for returning to O2 is because I always get a good signal both anywhere  indoors and outdoors.The £10 monthly pay as you go bundles are great valueThe one time I've spoken to customer services when moving my number back to O2 they were very helpful and polite.,2
Excellent service at the Tottenham Hale branch this morning was having trouble with my new Samsung phone... staff  could not do enough for me....well done good to see such great service...,2
"Been with O2 for years. If we ever get a problem our local O2 store is brilliant, manned by young switched on staff who will do anything to help. Never had anything but exemplary and friendly service. Faultless.",2
"Good network, reliable, helpfull customer service and friendly app. Been with them for the last 10months. I tried before giffgaff, Three, Vodafone and O2 is so far the best network for my needs.",2
"Spoke to Derek in customer services at lunchtime on 12.05.17 who was fantastic, he was cheeful , helpful, and dealt with my query in a quick proffessional manner, o2 have always been great when ive dealt with them but Derek shone like a little star.",2
"I have now left o2 and moved to another provider due to an introductory offer.Moving companies has made me appreciate how good O2 were. Everything they did was efficient. Even leaving O2 was easy. It was easy to get through on the phone, they did not try to hard sell, they just did what they were supposed to do.Having used Orange, Virgin Mobile and BT I would say that O2 are the best of the bunch",2
"I went to o2 in Shrewsbury  yesterday. I am a senior agent in customer services, I can honestly say the service I receive from Declan was outstanding. I have upgraded my contract to the new samsung a5. He was so helpful and made it all stress free. Please pass on this feedback and tell him he is great at his job.",2
"Over the years I used O2, I had very few issues and the customer service was always a pleasure!",2
"I ordered a 25GB Unlimited Minutes & Texts SIM-ONLY plan for £25 from O2 last year.I was emailed every step of the way during the progress of my SIM, all the way to dispatch.Once it came, I popped it into my handset and realised that 4G wasn't working.I went on the o2 site and spoke to an online agent who informed me that the 4G bolt on needed to be activated.They turned on 4G and told me it would take 24 hours to activate.The next day it was on perfectly.4G has been quick. no billing issues or anything else. Just a smooth service so far.",2
"Brilliant customer service. Been with them for 10years or more now and I was setting up a contract on the phone the other day with a very nice fella called Liam, very kind/helpful.",2
"I have to say, I was not with O2 for all that long as the 3G/4G coverage in the West Country wasn't great ....... yet.However I chopped and change tariffs, had reason to change my handset in store and perform quite a few changes to my tariffs.Not once did it get messed up, the O2 app was always spot on and billing too. I can't imagine the pain I'd have suffered if I'd tried to get VF to do any of this!In fact due to EE's poor indoor coverage I wanted to return to O2 but they can no longer offer the SIM deal I used to have :-(Anyway, regarding customer service, billing and shop staff in Falmouth, Cornwall ....... Well done O2",2
I've had an issue with O2 company that was lasting for 3 months until I spoke with guru Thomas Greenhalgh and fixed the problem when I didn t expected anymore.Really professional and great man! Thanks a lot!,2
"I went into the Manchester Arndale store today to purchase a new phone. The service I received from Sarah was absolutely brilliant. I am not a big mobile phone user. I only have one for emergencies really. Sarah sorted me out with just what I needed and then actually sorted the phone out ready for me to use. I also wanted to change my contract to one that suited my needs more than the one I had and she sorted all that out for me as well !!!!! I was absolutely amazed at the brilliant service she provided.I've used the same store a few times in the past and always been happy with the service, but today was exceptional. Thank you Sarah.",2
Must say a big thank you to the manager and staff members Laura and Scott for o lot of patient and helpful assistance today.  This is in marked contrast to the experience at the Kirkcaldy 02 shop.Problems completely resolved in a friendly and competent way.Many thanksIan,2
Customer Complaints team resolved my issue.,2
For 5 years I had a mobile contract with 02 via Carphone warehouse.Never had a problem and never had to contact them.,2
"After spending 2 years on the iphone 6, i thought i was gonna cancel the contract and just find another phone company but i decided to stay and upgrade toa iphone 7 and my monthly payments went down from £20 a month to £17 a month. Nice one O2 !",2
I have delt with 02 on many occasions and never had any problems there staff are very helpful and hard working.  They would do anything to make it alot easier. I would send anyone to this company that's how confident I am.,2
"In the office i work i have people telling me that i should move to another network for better 4G, more internet data, better coverage or cheaper bills, then i hear the same people saying how they have or are changing networks because of problems they are having. I have been with O2 for about 15 years and have never had an issue with them.  Always offer a good service with good deals and the refresh package is second to none and O2 priority is excellent.  Taking into account all the issues i hear from my work colleagues have had with their networks i don't see O2 is any worse than the others, i would love to see more reward for loyalty, but then that applies to a majority of companies.Keep up the good work.",2
"I came over from a different Network,from using my P.A.C Code to speaking to them on the phone, there was one issue but got sorted out immediately and then they credited £10.00 pounds too on my account, better coverage and Network-can't fault them at all. Don't know what these whingers are going on about they've been very helpful and not had a problem.Keep up the good work o2My Number is 07712492916",2
Would recommend everyone ✔But stay away  from EE,2
"Thank you to O2, Merseyway, Stockport, for superb service.  My much-valued old phone suddenly packed up, only functioning for a few seconds at a time.  The assistant was very helpful in explaining how to use my choice of new phone.  Even better, after a lot of effort and time, he finally managed to blue tooth across all my old contacts, which I would have lost otherwise.  Given the old phone would only function for seconds, it was amazing he managed to do this.  He also transferred all my photographs.  I am really grateful for the excellent service and would definitely recommend this shop.",2
No problems with this service except when coverage was confirmed to be low in my area.,2
I have been with O2 for many years now after leaving Orange due to stupidly high bills - going over my allowance constantly - and really poor coverage. I have nothing bad to say about the service provided by O2 apart from when someone fraudulently upgraded my account to a blackberry from an address in London - but they dealt with this superbly once they knew about it. Have recommended and my dad swapped after being with orange for 20 years.,2
I switched to a sim only contract. 1 month later I realised I needed more data allowance than I had - O2 have a 3 month policy before switching but the guy on the phone convinced his manager to switch me to a higher data tariff for less money. Best service ever.,2
Excellent customer service me and my wife received from George Wade at Colliers Wood branch.Top class experience. You need more staff like him. His services should be rewarded. Mr Nurse.,2
"I have been using the live online chat for a while now and every time I am 100% satisfied. The people are polite, concise, helpful, know hat they are talking about, and it never lasts longer than 15 mins. My phone was fixed within the blink of an eye too. I highly recommend the live chat.",2
"Never had any problems with O2.They don't charge for customer service, like EE do.They allow pay as you go customers to use 3g for £1, which is good for emergencies. EE makes you sign up to a £10 pack that only gives you 1GB.I've always had good experiences with their customer support.Would recommend.",2
Excellent customer service. Had an issue with my phone Matt sorted it out quickly. He was excellent I'd employ him tomorrow. Credit to 02 and the Dover store,2
I've been with o2 for about ten years. In this time I've had no issues with them at all over mobile contracts or broadband (back when they provided broadband). Their phones can be expensive - I bought my phone outright from another company and have a sim-only contract that works absolutely fine. Good coverage and uptime. Would recommend to friends and family.,2
"I absolutely love o2 , they are amazing and have a really good customer service. They also go out of there way to help people , well they have helped me a lot , i got a new contract with them at beginning of May 2016 and the phone came the next day and I have got the new iPhone 6s and they helped me set it up over the phone because I didn't have a clue how to set my Apple ID up and they talked me through it , they also told me if I couldn't afford the first months bill all in one I could pay it in two parts amazing highly recormend",2
"Ok, to start with, I've switched to o2 a couple of years ago and during my time with them, i lost my phone with the sim card. Went online and spoke to one of their gurus on chat. They sorted everything out straight away, old sim card blocked, new sim card with my number on the way, received it the next day. God I love o2. I'm on holiday now abroad and thanks to o2 travel bolt on I had activated months ago, i don't have to worry about using data or receiving phone calls. I can just use my phone as i do in the uk for £1.99 a day,no limit. My partner is on ee and every time we travel, it's the same story. He rings them up before we go to activate roaming just to having to get i touch with them again when it doesn't work. He'll be switching to o2 as soon as his contract is over. Well done o2, that's how it's done.",2
"I have been a customer with 02 for around 5 years.  I have had my issues as with any large organisation over the years.  I am writing this because over the last few years I have noticed O2 have made significant improvements in the way they conduct business (for me personally anyway).  I shop at a number of O2 stores but I would like to mention the team at Galleria in Hatfield.  They are professional but relaxed and always smiling.  The even remembered us the last time we went in.Another fantastic improvement has been their online payment system.  This used to be the worst part of my month as Im not on DD and I have 3 bills to pay. They have improved the system so much and it makes my life a lot easier.  This tells me they are focusing on continuous improvement and thinking about the customer me.Now, check out some of my other reviews and you will understand I can be critical, but in this case well done O2.  In my experience you are not perfect, but you are a million times better than companies like Vodafone!Keep improving.Paul Rhodes",2
"I can see a large number of bad reviews on here for O2. However, set up a SIM only contract with them for my mum. Her number was ported from another provider very quickly and hassle free and no bother with O2 customer service.The contract is a bit pricey and could be more competitive, compared to some other providers, but you do get what you pay for. Mobile Signal in her area is good too.I hope O2 try and address the bad experience that other reviews on here have had, it would be nice to think a company of that size would try.",2
"I have been with O2 on and off for over 10years (off because I went abroad) and compared to other companies they have given me a good experience throughout this time. If I ever have a problem I actually like calling them (which is not the case with other companies) because firstly I can understand them (English spekaing people, no call centre in India), secondly they always help, explain well, waiting times are very short, when in the queue the music is nice (and does not make me fall asleep or burst my ears). Bills are well explained, easy to look up, same goes for checking your left over minutes, text, data from your plan. I love the perks of O2 priority, in fact have gotten many presents for my son for FREE this way (and he was a happy little boy) and love the £1 lunch Mondays.Anyone looking for a hassle free, easy to deal with plan and company might want to check out O2. Even when I left them it was easy to obtain my PAC Code, no hard sales tactics, no wasting my time, instead a friendly ' Is there anything we can do?'. This is how it should be and this is why I went right back to them when I came back to the UK.A system that works, friendly and helpful customer service....thank you O2.",2
"I've been with O2 for six years now, first as a Pay & Go customer and now currently as a Pay Monthly customer, and I've never encountered any major issues. Just recently, after going through a painful two month ordeal with a certain Hong Kong based online electronics retailer, I ordered a sim-free Sony Xperia Z5 from O2's online store and the item was delivered to my local O2 branch the following day without problem. It was totally worth spending the little bit extra to buy a phone from a reputable company.In terms of their customer service, whenever I have an issue or query, or simply need my number changed, I find the online chat service offered by O2 to be very good - with most matters sorted within minutes.The only issue I've had over the years is, since moving to my current address, I have never been able to take out a new contract directly with O2. Instead I have had to acquire a Pay Monthly contract with O2 through Carphone Warehouse, such was the case with my current contract. But I suspect that's more to do with the credit check company rather than with O2 itself.",2
Took 2 hours to up grade as the email service was playing up and couldn't confirm my contract and give me a link. Paid £9.99 to have the phone delivered between 6.00pm and 10pm tonight. It was delivered to my neighbour at 2.00pm and the guy said we are a bit early. All in all a totally abysmal service. My advice is go elsewhere as o2 are a massive failure. I do not give them 5 stars that came up automaticly I would give them minus 500.,2
"Went in the other day as I had bought myself a recon Apple iphone 5, but not from them. I was expecting short shift as I walked passed all the new shiny phones they sell, but no, what I got was the most patient and helpful 'Stacey' who with the manager made me a new mini sim card. I am already an O2 customer but I got a tariff to suit my needs, nothing more. I can honestly say that the customer service was excellent, even on a busy Saturday. My son and I are both O2 customers and we are both planning on staying with them. Well done O2 in Brentwood, Essex, maybe some of the other O2 employees should spend a day there 'training'! Ask for Stacey, the most patient person ever.",2
My wife and I have been 02 customers for about 6 years.  We moved house recently and regrettably due to poor reception on our mobile phones we had to switch providers.  Over the years 02 have provided an excellent service and their staff have always been helpful.  Other mobile phone companies especially Vodafone could learn a lot about how to treat its customer from 02.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this company,2
We as a household have been with o2 for many years and never have we not been satisfied with them.Always helpful and sort out any problems we have .Very rarely do we suffer any signal problems .We find them excellent and even though sometimes there tarriffs can be more expensive we find it more benifical  to stay with them as the service they provide so out weighs any other mobile network we had previously been with..Thanks o2,2
"For those of you in London, my O2 coverage has been far superior since I swicthed from EE. The internet runs faster and I have less dropped calls.The customer service centre always resolve my issues, though sometimes they do keep you on hold for longer than you would like.I've renewed my contract with O2 for another year, even though I could pay less with another provider.",2
"Love O2, best mobile phone company I have been with. Stuck with them for several years and have No plans to move as a Customer.I recently added my Partner to my Contract. All good.Looking forward to my Upgrade in a few months.The only downside is when O2 goes down in our Area. But doubt we are the Only ones this happens too.Always found Customer services in store and online very helpful myself.",2
I like o2. I used them years ago without issue and I also had my broadband with them until they sold to sky. Their customer service was always second to none so I returned to them or my latest contract on a really great deal. Sadly it wasn't to be as the signal in my area wasn't very good and 3g in my area was non existent so I have had to cancel under the 14 day cooling off. However they were delightful about the whole thing and really helpful. I will update further if it was all too good to be true but for now....I wish I could have stayed with them!,2
"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Edge s7 phone at 6.30 at night and it arrived next morning.  I did it through live chat. It was superb.  Today I wanted to get my old number back and didn't have a clue how to do it so used Live Chat again.  I got a guru within seconds of logging on.  Abishek was chatting to me within seconds of logging on- he was pleasant and very knowledgeable- he answered my query perfectly and activated the number. Perfect customer service experience twice in one week and delighted with my s7... it's powerful, beautiful, the camera is amazing and it is a million times more durable than any other phone on the market.",2
"Very.co.uk should be trained by your staff, they are always helpful and rectify any issues there and then... Been with 02 for 5 years and have received excellent service throughout",2
"spoke to Tracy at o2 about my tariff and in no time at all she changed to something more suitable, no fuss, thank you Adrian Gardner",2
"I have been an O2 pay monthly customer for almost 5 years. I decided to upgrade early for my birthday as I'm on the 'refresh' tariff. Paid the remaining £100 balance for my old phone and ordered a Samsung S6.I ordered it to be delivered the next day before 10.30am.The phone arrived at 7.04am the next day, which was great because I do the school run from 8.30am-9am.Absolutely no issues with delivery or the actual phone which I have now owned for just under a week.I also called O2 to change my phone number which they managed to do quickly. The new number was active within the hour.I rarely have to contact o2 customer services, but when I do I feel that the staff always deal with me in a professional  manner.",2
I rang up trying to get my grandparents reconnected with their pay as you go sim as BT landline unavailable leaving them vulnerable.Straight through to payasyougo line (unlike other companies where you have to listen and press about 20 different buttons in order to speak to someone) then within 20 minutes my grandparents were up and running and connected again such a relief when they live so far away.Thank you O2,2
My name is Lucy and I popped into O2 store at frenchgate centre Doncaster to try and transfer all my files from old phone to new one. And had amazing service from a guy Steve. Helped with everything nothing was too much trouble. Also informed me of a better offer with 15% off my current sim only contract that I didn't know about so transferred to that. He sorted everything with my phone was so friendly polite. Very nice person. You have a really good staff member there.I have been with O2 for years and never had a problem with them ever xThanks very SteveLucy,2
"I called O2 in order to receive a PAC code so that I could change networks (no faults with O2, just wanted to try a different one). When I rang the number through my land line, I was answered with an automated reply of 'the number you have called is receiving a large number of calls so service may be slow' followed by 'press 1,2 or 3 for various lines'. I continued to press the numbers to go through to the correct extension, and was prepared for a long wait and awful music. However, the phone started to ring immediately and was answered not even after the first ring. The man who answered was lovely and cheerful, he started going off the usual scripted questions on what he could do to help, followed by my reason for leaving O2. Although he mentioned if I would be interested in a cheaper tariff, he did not keep pushing or try to sell the company any further, and went on to ask me the security questions in order to get the PAC code. Then while he was typing and generating the code, he started chatting to me about his day and asking me about mine while I waited, before giving me the code when he got it. An absolutely lovely man, genuinely concerned and interested in helping me as the customer. The best over the phone service I've had; I'm having second thoughts of leaving O2! It was a wonderful start to the day (I rang in the morning), and although I may have been lucky in the service I received compared to other reviewers, I am left incredibly impressed with O2.",2
"My mother was having problems with her phone and is quite Ill at the moment finds it hard to remember and can get quite confused, she was well looked after in store and given a glass of water. Nicola at Bangor store looked after her excellent. Thanks Nicola, phone is working great and on the best tariff for her thanks to you :). I wish that all shopping places had a Nicola to help!",2
Just renewed my contract after being offered a great deal upgrading (and I always shop around).. I have always found customer services with o2 one of the best. Never used a o2 store so can't comment on that as always been online or via phone but always found they've gone out of way to accommodate any queries or problems etc. Sorry the people in other reviews have had such an awful time and unneeded stress.,2
Just phoned 02 as usuall friendly helpful brilliant,2
o2 customer service help me  with  my phone problems,2
"Ive been an O2 customer now for about 8 years.  Ive stuck with them due to the fact I can get a signal pretty much everywhere plus their UK based customer service has always been very good.I just upgraded and took out another 24m contract with O2, but had major problems with the courier company.  Not O2 fault.  However, O2 got involved, and stepped in to sort out the problem with the courier, keeping me informed all the way.  Their social media team in particular are excellent.After getting the phone I then popped into my local O2 shop to get a case and they did a great deal on one for me. Always been very impressed with this company and their aftersales.  Happy to be a customer of theirs for another 24 months.",2
"Had an issue with the phone I had purchased via a deal through Amazon for the Amazon Fire Phone. Spoke to Amazon who refunded the phone once sent back, and spoke to O2 who were happy to move me over to a brand new phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) free of charge.",2
"Spoke to 3 different people during swapping of my phone, one told me a cheaper deal from a different place, one told me to enjoy my sunday but called it funday, and one said 'I won't go home until i'm sure did has been done for you' Amazing people!",2
"Received a call from Keiran at 19:45 on Tuesday 24th February, was very professional and informative, helped me out massively and has left one very happy customer, being a member of HR for a call centre myself I know the pressure agents are under but can safely say Keiran is one of the best I have dealt with.",2
"I administer mobile accounts for our business and experience all networks on a regular basis, so would recommend O2 every time, as my considerable experience has shown them to be reliable and trustworthy, whilst offering some great little add-ons like TuGo, which has slashed our roaming costs.Vodafone are a big lumbering beast, whose decline in the mobile market is well earned.EE are very well polished and have slick marketing and an aggresive sales force, but after-care is terrible and actually getting customer services to deliver on their promises is like asking a politician for a straight answer.",2
"I've been with O2 for the past 4 years now (having gone back to them after poor experiences with other companies) and they have been faultless in every respect. The level of customer service provided in particular at their call centre has always been nothing short of excellent. I have just attempted to purchase a new mobile/contract through Carphone Warehouse and another network provider due to the fact that they were offering it at a cheaper price than O2. Having had a problem with the online order, I called Carphone Warehouse, and I can honestly say I have never received such appalling customer service. I'm now ordering the new phone with O2, and will happily pay the extra for the phone and monthly contract, knowing that if I need support I can rely on  them to provide it in the same friendly and efficient manner I've come accustomed to. I had a lucky escape with Carphone Warehouse, and won't stray again!",2
Hellobeen with O2 for 7 years live in London area it's a great network always willing to help me and compensate me when they are in the wrong..I've been with all the other mobile networks and they all never ever had this much good customer service O2 the best ....they have great O2 apps as well plus SIM cards are for free unlike other mobile networks they charge u for a replacement so in my eyes 02 are great.....,2
People always complaint but they are much better than most other service providers,2
"I don't have a perfect credit rating but o2 accepted my application without deposit for not 1 but 2 contracts, I have had nothing but a totally reliable quality service and am very happy with them.",2
"I have just changed from EE to O2And the service has been excellent.Alan Gillespie has dealt quickly, competently and effectively with all issues relating to the transfer.The same is true for the rest of the 02 team. A far cry from the incompetent service at EE.",2
"Had no signal for an hour now. This is a disgrace, how can a national network of complicated technology have a small temporary fault like this. Everything should be perfect all the time that's why I pay £10 a month. This missed hour accounts for 0.1% of that 10 pounds; I hope management sees this and I get something free.",2
"o2 are friendly and helpful, i have never had a problem with them or known anyone whom has!",2
"A pain and stress free process of transferring from contract to pay as you go. They refunded me £3 straight away for a mistake that I had made with not switching off mobile data on my phone, occurring £5. I have never really had any problems, only minor which have been sorted out quickly.The website is clear and the online chat is quick and so much easier than speaking on the phone. They have a good selection of phones to choose from.",2
"Good service but sometimes no coverage, no problem with your customer service only the network sucks sometimes.",2
"I have been using O2 for over 7 years now. I have contracts for myself, wife and children with them. The customer service is always spot on. You actually speak to a person not just someone reading a script. The online chat advisors are all very competent and know their stuff. The deals are ok and when I haven't been happy (upgraded to a Nokia once which was s***) they swapped it, cancelled the contract I had taken out no quibble and I just started again with a different phone. Yes you will probably get more minutes on another provider, but I have used Orange and Vodafone in the past. I also worked for Vodafone for 4 years and I know the industry well. O2 are excellent at what they do. Plus their network is built on what used to be BT Cellnet as a result the call quality is excellent. I have a Vodafone as my work phone, in poor signal areas (I live in Devon so we have many of these) My O2 phone still has a reception long after Vodafone loses it's signal. Even on remote parts of Dartmoor!",2
"Finding it extremely frustrating to replace my broken iPhone 5 charger, I contacted O2 to be advised which of their variety of chargers would be the best for me to purchase. I contacted their customer service via live chat due to my busy schedule. I was transferred to the correct department in seconds, and the second adviser provided a replacement charger free of charge. Fast, Convenient and very Satisfied customer!",2
"I apologize for my previous review (negative). It was not O2s fault at all, but mine. First I gave a wrong number of my mobile requesting to unlatch. They wrote to me that number doesn't exist. Then I realized it was wrong indeed. Then I gave them a number, but I again realized few weeks later after reading the 'chat' record, that it was wrong too. Then I supplied the correct mobile number. Then they asked for its IMEI number, which they said can be found by dialing *#06# and I did that with my new phone without realizing that I should have dialed the above numbers using the old phone which I needed unlatching. So again I provided a wrong number. Later on I realized my mistakes and provided the correct details. Within minutes everything was sorted. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. But the customer care persons on their 'chat' were all extremely polite all the time. It was completely my fault right from the beginning. So readers please disregard my previous comment. I apologize unreservedly to O2, and to you readers.",2
"I realise that when writing a review you can only go  by your own experience.  Looking at the O2 score so far it appears to be some way from perfect but I have to say that in terms of the O2 Broadband service I received before changing a couple of months ago, it was excellent.  Rarely did I need to contact their Broadband helpdesk but whenever I did I found them to be very knowledgable and very very helpful.The only reason I moved is that O2 was being taken over by Sky.  I decided to move to Virgin - what a mistake that was!",2
"I took my faulty pay as you go Nexus 4 back to O2 in Milton Keynes on the 1st November, as the bottom half of the screen wasn't registering any touch. They stated it could take up to 2 weeks to be repaired, but typically it's done in 4-5 working days.Queue Tuesday the 5th on November, the phone turned up at my door at 8am, just before I head off to work, working perfectly. Amazing turn around time, will definitely consider buying phones from them in the future.",2
"Any time I have problems, they are available to help on webchat very quickly which saves me calling. I rate them 5 out of 5 for webchat. Thanks, Rach",2
"i do hope I am not testing fate! I have been with Vodaphone (dreadful customer care) and Orange (service became worse and worse as prices went up and up), having had a mobile for 20 years. I actually have 6 numbers on my contract. O2 have astounded me with their service and although I sympathise with those who have had bad experiences, be very careful who you move too. I'm sure if you speak to O2 complaints department (free of charge on your handset) they will be happy to help as they do seem to be concerned with customers and their problems.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years now, and am pleased with the level of service I've had over the period of time I've been with them. They are very helpful and have friendly customer service team! I have had friends who are with Orange and there is a huge customer service difference. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a contract, PAYG or any other service O2 offer to go with them.",2
"I have been on vodafone (absolute scam), 3 (bad customer service in general) & orange which have all been a nightmare. O2 are by far the best provider all round and i have been with them for 2 years, customer service is great, signal is better than most, they dont overcharge you ormess you about, i even signed up to pay an extra £10 a month for an iphone5 just to be on o2 rather than any other network.At the end of the day, with sorting out issues you have to go direct to managers. Everyone working for any provider are going to be the same, it depends whos on the other end of the phone. Although it shouldnt have to be like it, if you get rudeness back from a representative, just hang up & redial and you will eventually find someone who will help you.Just remember, when you are feeling angry & frustrated with the service your given, thats when your more likely to write a review to express your frustration. The best way to find out what network is for you is to ask family and friends for their recommendations.",2
"I have been with O2 for over 2 years now, and have been very impressed with the following:1. The Great Mobile Phone Coverage2. The Fantastic Tariff3. The super fast 3G Speed and coverage.4. The Out of this world Customer Service.5. The amazing Free mobile phoneI could go on about just how great 02 are, however I believe the above five points pretty much clarifies why I rate 02 at one of the best mobile phone providers in the UK, that I have had the pleasure to use.I cant wait for my next mobile phone upgrade and tariff review, as I am more than confident it will add even more value for money.Well done O2.",2
"I've never, ever had any trouble whatsoever with O2, was a pay and go customer for four years and the only reason I ever left the network was because the signal coverage for where I had moved to was poor. Something which O2 told me they'd look into when I told them I was leaving, no pressure from the salesmen on the phone who simply wished me luck and thanked me for my custom. I can always understand what the customer service representatives are saying and they are always helpful! Apart from my current location I have also never had any trouble with their coverage, signal strength and internet alike.",2
"My wife and I have only been with O2 for 3 months, but so far everything is perfect! Good signal, good deal on the new iPhone 5 and now we have decided to use their broadband service (Instead of Virgin Media's terrible broadband). O2 seems competent, friendly and has very friendly staff. Whenever I deal with them I go to their store on 286 Chiswick High Street. It is a bit out of my way, but the staff there is fantastic and they deserve 90% of the credit for making us stick with O2!",2
I am alwaye 02 customer this is best network & customer service in uk. I think the service is outstanding.,2
i love o2. best network and best service provider in the uk,2
"Even though we pay a bit more than other home broadband users, we've had really good service and connectivity. I'd recommend O2 anyday.",2
"I've been with O2 for 8 years and use them for my phone and internet.  I think the service is outstanding.  It is rare to find a large company that still genuinely cares about its customers.  On the rare occasion I have an issue, it is resolved immediately in a very considerate way (most of the time its my mistake).Bills always correct, signal is great, prices are reasonable to low but most of all their customer service is exactly what it says it is, a 'service for customers', something many companies have lost sight of.Please keep up the good work O2.  I think you are brilliant and actually enjoy calling your customer services.Thanks!!",2
I was experiencing problems with my original carrier and as unhelpful as they were O2 are extermely helpful and I have had no problems with their service.,2
"U get great signal all over and calls are really cheap, plus they give u goodies when u top up and I can talk to other o2 customer's for free x",2
"o2 is the best, but giffgaff uses them so cant complain with them too, best service, usually best deals, best customer service",2
"I am an O2 mobile and Broadband customer and have been using them for many years having been unsatisfied with Vodafone before.  They have great customer service and prices are decent.  Broadband wise, very quick speeds and easy to set up.",2
"Took my phone to the shop in cleveleys to buy a new charger, the girl that served me told me it was their responsibility to repair it as still under guarantee, which I hadn't realised, I was served within a few minutes, I was given a loan phone while mine was being repaired, within a few days I received my phone back, was kept informed at all times by text and phone call, I cannot praise them enough for their attention to detail, and the girl that served me was excellent. Thank you so much 02.Valerie jones.",2
"I've been with O2 for years now (at least 6) and I can't say that I have ever had a problem. I've always paid a reasonable amount, got a reasonable phone, had great reception (I know this depends on where you live) and whenever I've ever called them they have been quick to answer and very good at answering my question without passing me around some call centre.Ok, I do have one gripe - There contacts seem to be getting longer and longer. I'm sure at some point they'll give me a contract for life, but all the others do to so I can't moan too much.Overall (in my opinion) the best UK mobile phone company.",2
Somehow everything about them gives me a good vibe. I will always use O2. A happy customer!,2
"Whilst the signal strength in my area isn't great, I still achieve download and upload speeds well in excess of others in the area.3MB/s and 300KB/s where others can be as low as 300KB/s and 30KB/s or even less on a bad day!Their customer helpline has always been able to fix any problems quickly and courteously.",2
"I hear people find 02 customer service hard to get hold off, I've been with them for over 10 years now and have had no problems with them.",2
As a family we have three broadband sites and five mobiles and could not be happier. Whats more they have a uk help desk brilliant you can understand what they say well nearly it is based in Scotlaand. just joking.,2
"been with O2 for seven years, when contact O2 they have been very polite to resolve any queries we ever had and o2 priority moments have been extremely rewarding! I love them and no doubts that thy know how to keep customers happy! wanna free cuppa every week join O2!",2
"GREAT SERVICE, been with them for years and never any problems",2
"I have been with O2 for a number of years and have never found fault with the company. I have in fact persuaded my entire family and many many friends to switch to O2. Although I have been asked by other companies to use their services, I will never change.",2
Recently bought an O2 simcard on ebay that was a number I wanted but as I am with Tmob (dont get me started on them!) I had to transfer the new number. I contacted O2 customer service and the lady I spoke with was absolutely delightful!My son is an O2 customer and is always on to me to change to them...how I wish I had before taking out a new contract with Tmob.,2
"No - they may not always be the cheapest provider on the market, but their service is worth the little extra you pay in my opinion. No bad experience to date over several years of using them.",2
I have been with o2 since owning a mobile phone (many years). I have had no problems and will no doubt be with them for many years to come.,2
I will be sticking with o2 now and won't be changing provider again after my last mistake.Signal coverage is really good,2
Very good service would not go anywhere else,2
"All very handy and clear, fast and timely manner!",2
have been with this network for donkey years now. I am just too loyal to this company and have recommended it to people in past as much as i would continue to recommend it to others.,2
obviously im going to be a little bit biased about o2 as im an o2 customer but they are still one of the better network providers,2
A breath of fresh air after dealing with Orange..and I can get a signal now,2
"We've used o2 since it started, and having seen the experiences of competitors, we would not change.  The products are exactly right for us, as are the prices.",2
"Always been with O2, love the free O2 to O2 calls and online account management",2
Haven't used that often but enjoyed when I used it. Very easy to find stuff and use services.,2
"I have been an o2 customer for 15 years, and I have never had any complaints, their billis system is clear, their network is one of the best... my phone has signal 99.5 % or the time...",2
Have been with them for years without any problems. Staff a pleasure to deal with,2
"Have my contract with O2 not the cheapest but coverage is good and would not be without my iphone now, just waiting to upgrade at the end of my contract, christmas here we come !",2
I've used O2 mobile for years so that speaks for itself as I'm a person who looks for a bargain but without losing any quality. As soon as I heard  O2 were doing home phone and broadband I switched and am highly satisfied with the service. I advise all my family and friends to change to O2 as well.,2
"I love O2 and I love the 02 arena, it's my second home!",2
Good value and first class support and assistance,2
Not bad but can be better.  Top up web can be confusing.,2
Not the strongest signal but good contract.We are like an old married couple after all these years.,2
Great site so imformative and easy to use,2
"Never had any problems in all the time i have been with them, first rate company. *****",2
Best network coverage... Best deals.... Best prices... what else do we want?!,2
I HAVE BEEN WITH A FEW MOBILE NETWORKS BUT THE BEST ONE FOR ME IS O2. ALL MY FAMILY ARE ON O2 SO I GET FREE CALLS TO THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER MOST TO ME IN LIFE. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH 02 AND I SHALL STAY WITH THEM.,2
been with o2 for most of my 'mobile life'. great reception and great offers. best for contract deals.,2
"Use here in the Uk, I travel the world and I have never had any problems with connection, even in the remote parts of Africa, my trusted friend.",2
once I thought Vodafone is the Best.But now I know the best.O2 is the Best.No Doubts,2
good company wouldn't use any other network,2
have been using for 15 years or more now and i love the service website is so easy to use and check everything u need to u can even swap and change anything u want to with out having to spend hours on the phone. im the only one outta all my mates on 02 and im the only one who has signal every where i go. will continue to use this service for another 15+ i love it :),2
"They are offering good broadband service and have excellent uptime. Prices are affordable, recommended.",2
I have been with O2 since te days of btcellnet and I would have to have an extremely good reason to look elsewhere.,2
"I have a Pay as you Go account. I use my mobile about twice a year. I do not have to top up unless I have used up my time. O2 have never pressured me to change my useage. I use their service sparingly, it has always worked first time, and they leave me alone to get on with it. I could not wish for more.Update on 26 09 2014 ... two and a half years later.The service is still reliable and the rules are still the same. In concrete terms, when I've bought does not disappear on the basis of arbitrary time limit. I still pay only for what I use.",2
Not the best with techno. And help is always on hand.  Give them a bell and they sort me out.,2
"I've been with o2 for i dont know how long. Haven't ever had any probs with them whatsoever.The staff in their shops are so very helpfull, polite & never try and push you to take the dearest contract or pay as you go phone.You tell them what you want and they sort you out, end of.Brill, Brill, Brill!!!",2
never without a network and some good offers,2
"Helpful staff, set up phone, helped me decide on best mobile for me",2
Love 02 as that is who I am with & I would never go with any one els.,2
"Always connected and really good value. Im pay as you go but with monthly contract, the main thing is there have been no hidden surprises. Ill stay with O2 as long as they dont change too much.",2
ANY PROBLEMS ARE SORTED OUT WITH THE MINIMAL OF FUSS. GREAT RECEPTION,2
Not too many offers of free texts I never use!,2
excellent coverage in north east. fair price bands,2
"O2 have served me very nicely, they answer my questions and are always polite and friendly, as is their Live Chat.The reception is great on my mobile, their Broadband is reliable and hard to beat.",2
I have been a happy customer with O2 for 7 years......they have a package to suit every pocket,2
"Had pay as you go and contract phones with O2 and never any problems. Even when I decided to switch to Vodafone, but switched back again cos no signal at home!I have 2 contracts running at present and the local O2 shop staff are excellent! Even ended up getting a cheaper tariff with a different phone than one I originally went in to see about!It's all about customer focus!! Or that is what it feels like and I should know being into quality management!",2
"i have now been an O2 customer for a number of years and once again was surpassed by their customer service and support when my renewal was due, they listened, looked around and once again offered me exactly what i needed at a price i wanted to pay instead of trying to sell me what i didnt need  -  well done O2",2
"I had o2 years ago, then switched to 3 then switched back about a year ago. Signal reliability has been far better and their call centre doesn't seem to be based far overseas like at 3's. Good range of phones in store at a good price. No complaints",2
I have been an o2 customer for over three years and always they have been very supportive with help and information. As my needs have changed they have proved very flexible and always try to find the best deal for me. Their network coverage is good and I always have confidence in them. I am a great believer in companies that provide good value and good service and o2 tick all the boxes!,2
easy to contact all call's to them in the Ukweb site fast and simple,2
"The price for broadband for being an O2 mobile customer is amazing. I'm a heavy user of the broadband, using lots of bandwidth with no complaints from them. Speed stays consistent, never have any problem streaming Full HD movies on the XBox.Never experienced any billing problems and customer services are always helpful and friendly.",2
"All my family use a O2 mobile chip and I`ve tried another mobiles network but for me the best one till today is O2 Network, better mobile internet and calls from anywhere, just the best in my opinion.",2
Good prices & service but when calling customer service I get different answers each time I speak to a different operator.,2
Have used O2 via my Tesco phone for some years now.  Reliable service and good signal in most places.  Very satisfied.,2
very pleased with the service never had a problem in 7 years thanks o2,2
Ive been with O2 for several years & have never had any kind of problem. Recently got a iPhone & Blackberry from O2 so was transferring numbers/sim's and they done it all for me! Honest customer service & best of all UK Call centers unlike other networks! People have had problems with O2's delivery courier YODEL and YODEL have the worst reviews for delivering but Ive never had any kind of problem with them delivering my 2 phones. 5/5 FOR O2!,2
"I have been with O2 as a mobile phone service provider for well over a decade!  I have switched between different tariffs and services with ease, taking best advantage of what is available at the time.  The service is so good that you can have it and forget about it!  Billing is clear and easy and the signal is superb!  The deals are pretty good too.",2
I ordered a new phone at 5pm and it was delivered by 12 the next day. Couldn't ask for better service than that,2
After 10 years with another company O2 have proved to be an excellent alternative. I was offered as fancy or as basic as appropriate and am very pleased so far after 2 months,2
I've been with O2 since 2005 and have never had any problems with them. The network is great and never fails. All of my family are with O2 and connecting is so easy. I also like the number of tariffs available. Excellent!,2
"Pretty much 100% uptime on their broadband and never seems to drop in bandwidth. Might be contention ratios but it's a very good service and the help line, whenever i have needed it, has friendly and competent employees (with no hard to understand accents....thankgod!)",2
"I purchased a HTC mobile Phone on Contract and i have always been pleased with the help given to me regarding the initial purchase and the customer care help team are second too none, they are knowledgeable on there products,helpful and polite at all times.I would not use any other provider.",2
Been with O2 for years and as you would expect it's not been a trouble-free period of time. But they step up to the plate and resolve issues perfectly in my opinion.,2
Just to say thank you for your amazing telephone customer service :),2
Excellent coverage tariffs and after sales service,2
"I switched to O2 just over a year ago having been (unfortunately) an Orange customer fo years. The difference in customer service simply amazed me, on my first bill they overcharged me by not removing a bolt on, the customer service immediately corrected it, apologised and put a credit on my account as a goodwill gesture. I have never had a billing problem since, and the customer services provided and cost are excellent. I will definitely stick with o2 for the forseeable future!",2
"I use simplicity and have done for about four years now, love that 02 to 02 if free - i also pay £10 per month extra for international calls - i get three numbers and can ring family members with nothing else to pay other than the £10 - brill - i also get a spanish number included in this so my family can ring me (its diverted straight to my mobile) and only pay local ratesIf you have family abroad I would highly recommend this service",2
"My work phone is on Vodafone and my personal phone is O2. My personal phone is always in signal and never drops out of range. I always struggle with Vodafone to get a signal, even when I am in London.",2
Been with O2 for the past 5 years and they havent let me down. Great service/reception and customer care. I recommend O2.,2
I have a monthly account and a pay as you go one they are both very good value for money,2
I have never had any issues regarding the O2 network. I have managed to constantly get signal wherever I go for phonecalls/texts and mobile internet.,2
"They're just great. Excellent customer service, good tariffs and nice little touches like the rewards. I'll probably never switch to anyone else.",2
"I have been an O2 customer for over 13 years and have always been satisfied with their service, contracts and deals. In a world of sharks that are the other telecommunications companies O2 is second to none.",2
"but o2 must give prepaying customers treats too, quite pricey if you dont get the right deal.",2
"I bought my first iphone, however I did the whole thing on the web, maybe I could have got a better deal over the phone as I have been with O2 over 2 years.........However I cannot fault the service and the web site to monitor my account is very good compared to their competition. Delivery of phone was very fast. I am thinking of moving my home broadband to O2 soon, also may move my wifes contract to O2.",2
This is the best signal in most areas in paignton tried the other networks but this is by far the best,2
"I have been with o2 mobile for over 2 years now, so they were able to offer me by far the most reasonably priced broadband package.In the first week I had issues with the speed so I called there customer services and what a pleasant surprise!! UK based call centres every time, and so helpful, the agents were able to guide me through the settings and resolve my speed issues, I now have super-fast, super-cheap broadband! Thanks",2
"I joined BT Genie a worrying number of years ago and when it became part of 02 so did I. Since then I have had many years of good service and helpful support from this company and I have just signed up for another contract with which I had a good price on an iphone 4s.  Their website and on-line service are great and their customer service and sales team are informed and helpful. Best of all they haven't dodged billions in tax.  I would recommend 02 to anyone because of all the horror stories I have heard from friends using other phone companies - you don't get that with 02.  I have had 15 years of honest, reliable, good quality service and that must surely be almost unheard of in this sector.",2
"After having the misfortune of go over to 3. I am please to be back with O2. Their customer service Team is top Notch and welcomed me back, they did not try and sell me something that I did not want and they listened to me, I love the fact that I spoke to a local person,",2
"THIS SITE IS A WINNER ,O2 SITE IS SO EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR . 100% WINNER WITH ME .JASON",2
"I have been with most (or all) of the major mobile service providers.  O2 have a way of making me feel special, by proactively informing me of benefits I may be interested in.Example:  I received a call as an iPhone4 user in advance of the iPhone4S release to see if I wanted one on the release date.  Very considerate.  And it was a local  UK call centre and they knew a lot about my usage.Good work O2!  Now about those excessive;ly high roaming charges...",2
Ive had a contract with o2 now for about 18 months. Can fault them at all. Great copmpany,2
"very helpful, good value been with them for over 14 years mever had a problem",2
I have been with o2 now for a good few years and I have never had a problem with them. The customer advisor Ash in the Kettering store in Northamtponshire is always helpful and nothing is ever to much trouble for him. Keep up the good work o2.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 12 years. I have always enjoyed the best customer service, some great deals and total efficiency when occasionally things have gone wrong. I just love 02!",2
"Been with vodafone and tescos, o2 are always very very helpful and responsive",2
"Excellent choice of tariffs, they could use updating though as some other porviders have even better deals for new customers however, O2 will not be beaten on deals for loyal customers! Been with them 4years not a single problem!",2
"I find my experience with O2 just amazing. They  have the best prices and the best customer service ever. I had a problem with the landline and they refunded me the difference for the phone calls i couldn't make. My bandwidth was low once and an engineer spent hours with me on the phone trying to understand where the problem was and finally he found it!! I've been a customer for years and called them many times, they are always helpful and always very kind in every single phone call i made. A rarity in these days.",2
Been with various phone companies but O2 is one of the best ive been with deals are very good and its very cheap. Would recommend.,2
Have been with the company on contract for 13 years (in various forms) and have never had a problem,2
"been using 02 for 10years now, wouldnt use another service, I hope they continue to be the best, they have affordable packages for everyone, I have continual service whereever I go, 02 for life.",2
"Always great service, no problems with bills and upgrades are always delivered on time. I have been using them for about 16 years (Was BT/Cellnet before)",2
"Recently left Sky for O2 with regards phone and broadband, the service up to now has been first class. I am already a customer of O2 with mobile contract of many years",2
JUST MOVED TO 02 FROM ORANGE MUCH BETTER SIGNAL,2
No matter where I am o2 does deliver.,2
"I am an 02 pay as you go customer and have been for years. It's great because if you top up £15 a month you get unlimited calls and text to other 02 customers and everyone I know is on 02, plus you still get to keep you £15 credit. Also every 3 months 02 give 10% of your top up back which is another bonus. Great network to be with.",2
"Treated like an adault. And not a fool, good company, good deals, and offers that are all usefull. Unlike other company's with gimicky rubish.",2
better than the rest... at least for me....,2
"Great service, Great communications No hassels",2
i love 02 because if you dont top up for a bit you will get sone money free..,2
Always have used this service. Good for your money.,2
always good service from this company. still want to get my hands on a new iphone 4 s though!,2
Never had 1 single issue.I am an o2 gold customer and love that I get upgrades early,2
Superb service always in signal and helpful customer care,2
"Great coverage, excellent handset choice, competitive costs and ~ Priority Tickets!I was so impressed as a private individual that I switched my company business to O2.",2
best deals no matter what always got some new scheme or deal,2
Have been with O2 for over 10 years have had loads of other companies try to take make me swap.  Not interested i have alway found the customer service to be second to none. So I will be staying put,2
"I've been a customer of o2 for quite some time, and I must say I'm impressed.To start with, I find that they have a nice reliable network. I can usually get a good signal about 90% of the time. The 10% is probably out of town, in rural areas. As for 3G, this has improved a lot in my area, which is due to more masts being installed by them. Again, 3G coverage is very patchy in rural areas.I've never had a call dropped, and have I probably only missed about 1% of any messages that I've been expecting.I guess their mobile data lets them down a little, but to be honest, I don't use it that much so I can't really rate them down for it. It would be better if it was cheaper, and had more of an allowance, but it seems to work reasonably well for me when I do ocassionally connect.Support has been great too. Whenever I've needed to contact them, It's always been a quick, and pleasant experience. They seem to know what they are doing, and get it done for you.What I love the most is the loyalty to their existing customers, along with the rewards for their new customers. They are always coming up with new and exciting schemes to reward it's members, all of which benefit me. If I left their network, I'd miss those.",2
"I have been with o2 for many years (after a brief and silly fling with another network, but we don't talk about that period).Recently I decided that I wanted to purchase a blackberry, but on Pay As You Go.I have found that o2's blackberry sim is absolutly fantastic. I top up my £15 pounds a month and then I get Blackberry Services, 500Mb AND 500 texts, all COMPLETELY FREE!!!!Then, when I had a problem setting it up, I went on to their website, and a friendly guy popped up and started chatting to me about how to fix the issues! It was quick, easy, and I didn't have to spend forever on hold whilst paying a fortune on my phone call.O2, I will NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN, and I'm still really sorry about that incident where I did for 2 months. It was a mistake. Forgive me?",2
"I am and have been an O2 customer for the last 8 years.I have Mobile Contracts, Home Phone & Broadband subscriptions with them and have yet to be disappointed.The Broadband is as advertised (my area doesn't get great speeds - but they accurately informed me of the speeds I would get - thus managing my expectations) and their Home Phone service is great value for money.Their mobile contracts are similarly good - and in many cases beat their competitors hands down.They offer a £5 per month discount on their Home Phone & Broadband contracts for O2 Mobile customers and always ensure that existing customers are offered the same great deals and new ones - whether that be 1/2 price broadband for six months or exclusive mobile contracts.A very, very happy customer! I hope O2 continue to put such an emphasis on great customer service and value for money.",2
"I'm very happy with O2. When my house was burgled, they were extremely helpful, and within 48 hours, I had a brand new phone, same number, minimum disruption. I rely a lot on my smartphone for business, so I was very happy. Since then, the service has been great, and the signal is very strong wherever I go, luckily.",2
"I wouldnt go with any other network,o2 is the best for everything, they are second to none and i would recomend them to everyone.Happy customerXx Cat xX",2
I have been with O2 for many years and find the company trustworthy fair and customer friendly,2
Very helpful company with 24/7/365 free to call UK Customer Service.Brilliant for Broadband also.  Have never had a problem with signal reception.,2
I am on Orange wife is on O2 she is happy I am very unhappy .....says it all,2
"on the ball every time with good service nothings to much trouble , i even phoned up on a sat phone to get more credit and they where very quick to deal with me when i told them how much it was costing",2
I stupidly went to orange last year after over ten years with o2. After a nightmare time with orange and their customer service (that should be lack of it) feel like i'm back home,2
"I have been with 02 for years,since they were BT CELLNET and i would never go with anyone else.Their website is first class and they are constantly updating & trying to improve it by asking their customers what they think.You can actually see the feedback they receive being implemented into the upgrades,its very good.TOP MARKS FOR 02,I WOULD NEVER CHANGE SERVICE PROVIDER.",2
This is a must for people with smart phones especially iphone users. I bought my iphone from apple and ordered an O2 Simplicty tarrif. The sim came within 2 days and was activated straight away. This is by far a superior service to any other mobile provider. Highly Recommnded,2
My phone is from tesco and they share the network with o2. It's great as i get a signal everywhere and my mates who are on orange don't!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
have used them for the last 2 years and have been very happy.  My latest HTC is great,2
"Four years I have tormented O2 with my Phone contracts, each time I manage to confuse them, do they care? You bet they do they always get me back straight and the customer service is brilliant, as is their O2 Phoneshops.",2
Good response and backup from customer care,2
"Got next day delivery on my upgrade.  I always recieve a friendly, fast and efficient service.  I have been with O2 for 5 years and I wouldn't use another company.",2
...avoid the on-line gurus that take an age to respond to your questions. I actually thought it may have been a computer program as their responses were so slow. I asked to speak to their supervisor and that wasn't much better!However I have been with )2 for over 10 years and this is the only complaint I have!Still 5 stars for me!!,2
I have been with o2 for years and have nothing but good feelings towards them!i have recently had to deal with the customer service dept ( a few probs i have had with my broadband and home line) They were very helpful and sorted my problems out straight away!.I would definiately reccomend them to anyone.Especially the broadband and home phone line package (you get a £5 off each month if you have a mobile with them!),2
"i have been with 02 for years, its never let me down and they are always very helpful and polite if i have ever needed to call them. i`ve never had a problem with 02 in the past and i love the 02 surprises you get when you topup i look forward to many more happy years with them.",2
"I have been with O2 for around 5 years now, their service is second to none, and their service team is always so helpful",2
Love o2.I top up £15 a month and get free calls and texts to other o2 users  which is great as loads of people I know are on o2.So you still have your £15 to call landlines and othe networks.,2
"I've been with o2 for years, it's very rare that I can't get a signal on my phone. In fact, I was once 3000ft up the Schiehallion mountain in highland Scotland, and my phone rang... the reception was as clear as a bell.I've had their broadband for 2 years, and it stopped working once. I switched the router off then on again, and away it went.I'm constsntly listening to people at work moaning about their providers, I'm glad I stuck with O2.",2
No problems great reception. Very helpful staff,2
"I am on the O2 Simplicity 300 tarif and they have never let me down. I also get unlimited data for £7/month and have never had a problem with this.The support staff are good, and have reduced the ammount i have to pay a couple of times whilst still getting the same deal on minuites and texts.I also get free O2 to O2 calls, so me and my girlfriend are very happy :-)",2
"Im on a plan that I get unlimited texts and 100 mins on a rolling monthly contract of £10but give them a ring if you are on pay as you or contract go and just talk to some one there to sort out some bolt-ons or change the contract to what you actually want this is the best way to get a good deal.good way to get the best out of ur contract is to say that another company is offering 'xxx mins and unlimited texts  for the same price as im paying now for half as many minuets and 300 texts'. use other companies deals to your advantage they will normally match them.They may offer ;Extra texts ,mins or internet1 min = 1 textmaybe extra texts or internet for loyalycheaper tariffsThey have room to negotiate just be nice :D",2
"Been an O2 customer for many many years and never been let down once. If there was a problem, it was easy to fix. Great customer support in both online and offline.",2
Always so helpful and sort out the problems straight away.,2
"As a customer for over 10 years, I must say that O2 are certainly consistent in their good customer relations.  Their deals are among the best out there too.",2
I have been with 02 for a number of years now and have never had a problem with them ever. I love the customer service as they are so helpful and always try to make sure your query is dealt with and that you as the customer is happy.I have not just a contract mobile phone with them but also their home broadband and home telephone and I can say I have never had any problems with any of them. The fact that they seem to get good network coverage is a huge bonus and the prices are excellent for the broadband and home phone line a little bit pricey for contract tariffs but with the network coverage and customer service I can't complain.Keep it up 02 an excellent job.,2
"o2 stands out from the crowd, as one of the first company to start getting things right. I have my mobile, land line & broadband with them.I am not a heavy user, so I don't make lots of calls or text messages. But I get screwed on hand set prices when ever I upgrade.",2
"i have been an o2 customer for almost 3 years now and they keep surprising me positively over and over. being nothing more than a humble pay and go customer, i am well happy with the amounts of great offers and tarifs being thrown at me almost constantly. none of the other prividers takes such good care of those who are not yet willing to go for a contract offer. and i really love the top up surprises!",2
Great for using in UK and even abroad. Has been with me many years. Love it. :),2
"Excellent service, good deals, great signal (most of the time) what more can you ask for?",2
Thank you O2 for helping with my new mobile phone purchase.Your help was greatly appreciated.,2
"I have been with O2 for years and have never experienced any problems with the provider. I would rate their customer services as good. On one occassion I had a problem with a smartphone I had purchased from somewhere else, O2 were still happy to help and did their best to resolve the issue. Although I never swear allegiance to them (I always look for the best deal even if it means switching providers, I'm with Orange at the moment!), they are better than some of the providers out there.",2
"I find in the southeast o2 is the only network that works in all areas, with no nosense. Better than any of my friends and their phones.",2
"Have been with 02 for 4 years, great reception in most areas.",2
I have used O2 Home BB for 2-3 years now and find their serice to be impeccable. Really excellent service and well recommended.,2

I travell all over the world and have never had a problem with this network. Have been with them for years.,2
"Always have been with o2 and find their customer service, rewards and incentives great. Love that advisors make sure your pay and go tarrifs suit the customer not their income. Will always recommend them to friends and family and customers that I deal with on a day to day basis as a sales advisor. Good job to the company and the staff, rare thing to come by these days.",2
"02 the network that always has a good signal, and if you do get a problem their customer service is second to none",2
"Been with them for 8 years and have never had a problem with them. Upgrades good, customer service brilliant. Polite and professional.",2
"what's not to like, you get a free email account & 200 free webtexts a month, it's really good value for money",2
I've been a O2 customer for over 8 years now and I've never had a problem. Would recommend to anyone.,2
great funky company that does the sale thing but with decorum!,2
"The most generous mobile network with all sorts of extras for free - Treats, Surprises, Rewards.  You also get all sorts of allowances as well as retaining your top-up credit and can choose from a  huge range of Bolt-Ons.  I've been with O2 for about 8 years and will never change!",2
Ive been on o2 for as long as i can remember and it has just got better and better providing me with personalised rewards and chances to win things.,2
Been with them for years.We use Orange and Vodafone at work and sometimes struggle with reception.I never do with O2.,2
Never had a problem with that company!!!,2
"My first ever mobile phone was on O2 and I'm still with them now £$%& years later!  With the rewards system, the bolt on options and the generally excellent signal coverage I've never felt the need to go anywhere else.  Not often you can say that in this day and age, but I am and always have been happy with my mobile phone provider.",2
"Been using O2 for business mobile for 5 years. Excellent coverage, easy to use website, reasonable prices, good service and nice upgrade options.",2
Excellent customer service! I swear by O2.,2
"smashing network, love the rewards wouldnt swop for any other network well satisfied.",2

"I've been with o2 for a very long time - never had any major problems, and even with the little things customer service is always a pleasure to deal with and sort problems out quickly and efficiently.",2
I have been on O2 for 5 years and I have always found them to give excellent service.,2
i have  got o2 since i came here in the UK.My cousins got other networks and when i compare prices and network coverage its good man,2
Love o2 always have and will never change my network,2
"Simple... I like loyalty and reward it in life. So, when my phone went on the blink last year and I was two months from the end of my contract (usually spending £200 a month!) I hoped T-mobile would do the usual and offer an early upgrade. Amazingly, they took a hard line and sad a flat NO! Even though I have held my account with them since it was one2one in 1996!So, once my contract, my mobile broadband, my personal mobile phone, my wifes phone and car phone were up for renewal I moved the lot to O2. Better customer service, cheaper, better signal at work and home and I have been offered early upgrades - for being a LOYAL customer. Well done O2!",2
Initially I went through Carphone Warehouse & never had substantial connection issues & the price plan was reasonable.  They also supplied my a very reliable handset.  I have been very pleased.  I have just recently changed my contract/price plan to match my current employment.  I am dealing with O2 direct & so far I have found them very easy & convenient to deal with.  I have been a customer for about 4 yrs.,2
I have been with O2 for quite a while now. My wife also has a phone with them. We have had excellent service and will continue to use them for the foreseeable future. Their tariffs are fair and the optional bolt-ons are a brilliant idea.,2
All the family are on contract with 02.  There customer service is excellent and they are always very helpful and efficient.,2
The best network by a mile was with 3 mobile never ever go with them maybe cheap but you will never get a signal.,2
I get great signal and text messages allowing me to book tickets early at events happening at the o2. Need i say more?,2
"I had my phone stolen recently and as soon as it was reported to O2 they acted right away, and couriered a replacement handset to me the very next morning. By comparison with my normal contents insurance - it took me weeks to sort out a replacement laptop.",2
never any problems but if there was they soon sort it,2
had no problems with this sevice provider whatsoever.,2
"I never get any problems with O2. Always manage to get a signal, no delays sending messages, no problems with billing.Always get excellent service with polite and knowledgeable staff at call centre.",2
excellent network give you lots of free things back unlike any other network,2
I am at the moment enjoying my 4th year with O2 iphone contract as well as 2 year ISP contract.  great job O2 keep it up.,2
I have three phones all with o2....all three smartphones of different types. One purchased over the counter..and two online.Online account with the ability to 'join' all of the accounts and manage the phones is excellent and easy to use.Real level of expertise in the shop (Worcester).Never had any problems with connection or the phones supplied.I've upgraded two of the phones online at the end of contracts with no problems at all and fast delivery on the new handsets.No hesitation in recommending.,2
Never had any problems first class service,2
"I've tried Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile and left them all due to poor service, both customer and phone reception. I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, I have my mobile, landline and broadband with them. Their customer service is second to none, they don't charge an extortionate amount for contacting them either should you need to (which in my case is rarely). I cannot recommend O2 highly enough and no I don't work for them, just one incredibly satisfied customer.....rare in this day and age I know.",2
i've been with o2 for over 10 years and never had any problems customer service is always 10/10,2
Good service they offer and great customer service too,2
Good reception n very good customer service.May be the price is slightly higher then other networks but standard is too good.,2
"Always great signal wherever I go, no point having a mobile if yr running around trying to get connected",2
after a terrible year with the three network in ireland i changed back to o2 got a free phone and double top ups for a year great customer support far better than 3's miserable attempt from some call center india where i couldnt understand anyone and got no where,2
We use O2 for our mobiles and home broadband. We have contacted their customer service via phone for both mobile and broadband queries and each time they have answered our questions succinctly and clearly. They have been friendly and polite. Similarly when we visit their stores the service provided has been great. We usually visit the store at Fulham Broadway. All the staff are friendly and helpful and we leave satisfied. Sometimes the process of changing plans can take a little while however it does not worry us as the staff are friendly and have a chat with us so the time goes really quickly. We are seated and offered a glass of water so we are made to feel comfortable. It is not like our experiences with some other organisations where you can't wait to leave the store. Thanks O2.,2
"have myself, my husband, and my daughter on o2 network!",2
Always with the best coverage and good deals,2
"A high class service with very helpful people,",2
"I have been with 02 for over 10 years and would not use any other network they have brilliant customer service, and are always happy to help.",2
"I recently went to spain and managed to tot up £435 of roaming charges (unknown to me, some how). When i got back and found this out i explained the situation and they let me off (thank god). They aslo told me next time i go abroad i should get texts letting me know when i hit certain spends on data.Great service 02!",2
"Who else gives you free incoming calls abroad? when you spend as much time in Europe as I do, its a no brainer being with 02",2
I been with 02 for over 10 years now and wouldnt change.,2

Been with O2 since they started and have always had good service from them and their network.,2
"No hassle straight friendly service which deserves loyalty. I am treated as a person, not a customer. After serveral new phones, contract renewals and general enquiries, each time I have left the O2 shop (Ipswich) feeling happy with the service I have received. Well done, keep it up.",2
ive been with 02 some years and always found thier customer care second to none and also have great service and they constantly looking for ways to keep ur tariff to suit u and save u money.,2

"I have the best deal for my usage and easy to view my bills online, I get good signal when others fail.",2
"I have used several ISP's over many years and I am now going to use O2 for as long as possible. The charges have just been increased, however this is not a problem as the service is the best I have received. They offer a fast and reliable Broadband service which there competitors have failed to provide ton me.",2
This is the only company i have been with and i am happy to stay with them as I have no complaints with the service they give.,2
"Always have a signal, never had an issue with them.Just use my phone and thats it.........would recommend due to always having a signal",2
"Always have coverage, never have messages undelivered and the contracts offered are very well thought out offering exactly what the customer needs!",2

Been with them for 5 years now and not considered changing once,2
they are always helpful - simply brilliant,2
"EXCELLENT SERVICE, POLITE STAFF, AND COVERAGE NEVER A PROBLEM.WEHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK ?",2
"I left another network for O2, and found the network coverage to be out of this world!! Internet is so quick for my Iphone. A special mention for their Customer Service team.....Any time I had problems, customer services would walk me through it, not in a hurry to get off the phone like other companies!!! It felt like they WANTED to help me and sort me out.Also very good prices!!",2
i have been with o2 for many years now and have never had a problem once,2
"Since being a member of O2 3 years ago, i have never had an issue with their service. This being mobile network service and also the customer service teams. They are always super friendly and more than willing to help. It actually reminds me of the Apple customer service which is renowned as being excellant.Another great thing i have to take my hat off to O2 for is when the iPhone 4 was launched. I waited in the massive que to get my much anticipated iphone 4. They made sure i got one without a hitch. To add to the excitement they were handing out free cakes and newspapers to people queuing which i thought was a great touch.Happy to be an O2 customer and reccomend to anyone.",2
"Whole family are on o2. The simplicity tariff's are suitable and affordable to our needs no comparison, and excellent service!",2
"Have had a pay and go mobile for many years now but last December  decided to change to contract. Visited our local o2 shop and found the salesperson Gary very helpful indeed. He did an excellent job of helping me understand the new phone I had picked and set it up very quick and efficiently. Great service, thanks Gary",2

"having had an express courier business for many years which demanded good communications, i found myself let down by many top phone companies,poor reception, hundreds of miles of road network not covered by different aerials,gave me years of fustration and loss coupled with ever increasing contract costs which did not reflect the poor service i was receivingThen along came o2 LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. my communication problems disappeared overnight.with various contracts to suit my needs, i had at long last found a communication company who puts their customers first.    norman murray.",2
"i got new phone and o2 helped me to be up and running in no time,great monthly deals on pay and go",2

"We have just been to our local store in Taunton somerset, our man there was Rob, he did O2 proud he was so helpful and could answer all our questions, well done O2 for employing staff who do their utmost for customers and your company.",2
The item arrived by return as promised.,2
"The staff are always helpful, efficient, knowledgable and true to their word - If they say they will do something they do it..... The contract is amended, the phone arrives, the times are accurate - They are consistantly good.",2
good network coverage and low prices without any problems ever,2
I posted my phone off and the money was credited to my account the next day.,2
I have been with O2 for several years and have had nothing but excellent service for all the years I've been a customer of theirs. The reception and signal are great and the coverage across the UK is good too.,2
probably theis most helpful bunch of folk you wish to mdeal with,2
Proffesional company with their customers always in mind.,2
Always found O2 to have a network and coverage better than the competitors. Would not use any other now,2
"Fantastic.  I have been with them since I owned my first Mobile phone, would not change.",2
"I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, having previously been with Orange and Vodafone. I find O2 offer great customer service (on the few times I've had to call)I use the PAYG sim in an iphone, so for £15pm I get unlitimed text, unlimited internet and a good few minutes. I also get the 'Surprises' which are not amazing but certainly add a bit of fun to things.No plans to change anytime in the near future",2
"i have had a few pay as you go mobiles from o2 and have had brilliant service and coverage each time. i have also had a pay as you go mobile from orange and a contract from three, niether of those were any good compared to o2. tesco mobile is good but then it uses o2 so it would be. i have now got a contract with o2 and i have had no problems at all ive always got a signal, the phone is a samsung wave but is cheap as i have free minutes and texts and 500mb of free downloads. there customer service is the best ive ever dealt with too!",2
from start to finish about six days.very pleased with this company,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years... they have always given me a great service. Very helpful advice in relation to my bill, contract and upgrades. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",2
"I've been a customer and user of O2 for nearly a decade now and wouldn't ever think of changing to another company. Really can't fault them. Why people even bother to go to their competitors is beyond me - especially with O2's advantage over Orange in that they aren't founded on Evil, or the malice and corruption of Vodaphone and T Mobile.Plus, since they took over the old Cellnet transmitters it means that O2 have consistently the best coverage of anyone.",2
"Have been with o2 for almost 7 years and never had any bother with service, Any queries and or questions dealt with quickly and professionally. Easy to use web site with easy to read and simple to follow instructions.",2
"I've been with 02 for many years and have switched providers on many occasions if i've bought a new phone with a different providers sim card. I find that 02 have the best tariffs for me, i text and use the internet a lot but don't really make calls, i had the 500 texts and 500mb of net for £15 a month but that wasn't enough texts for me so i changed to unlimited texts to 02 as everyone i know is on 02 and when i top up £15 i get the benefit of free calls to 02 although i don't use them, i have bought a bolt on so i get 500mb of net a month for £7.50 so for my £15 a month i get internet and unlimited texts.I love how on 02s website they have the option to live chat with an advisor, that way you don't need to make expensive phone calls or wait days on a reply to an email that might not answer your question fully.I have one complaint and that was i ordered a mobile phone and it never came on the allocated day, i got in touch and i was lied to, i asked to cancel when it never arrived and i was told there was no way i could cancel even though i have full rights to cancel. It finally came 1 month after ordering, was peeved off that they lied to me on more than one occasion about the delivery instead of being straight forward.",2
"Great deals, particularly for pay as you go customers.Hardly any network problems. Friendly staff.",2
i have always been on o2 until recently and seriously regret coming off because out off all the networks o2 defiantly has the great coverage the only problem is it is the most pricey of them all.,2
"ive tried most networks but o2 is by far the best good network great freebies , also very helpfull customer service",2
"With O2 i have never had a problem i ordered my pay monthly phone ages ago, i prefer contract savnig having to keep a eye on your credit all the time, and i never get sneaky bills added on, you get great offers from o2 like o2 arena stuff, i rare lose signal compare to orange and voda who mates of mine lose it quite alot. Be a customer of them for 5 years now, cant go wrong really :D",2
"helpful, thoughful and considerate anwers to elphone inquiries",2
i can recommend this company to friends.,2
"Having transferred from another company I find O2 to be a better company throughout. They were speedy with delivery, accurate with the bills and are very friendly to deal with.",2
"O2 represents, in my eye, the best value for money, coverage, customer service and perks/rewards of any of the big network providers. I have had some very bad experiences with other providers and I am pleased to say that ,as a current customer of both O2 mobile and broadband, I have not a single complaint to make about the superior service",2
The customer service at O2 Stroud was brilliant.  Thanks to Donna for her efficient and friendly manner. Would recommend her and O2 Stroud to anyone,2
"Easy to deal with, never a problem with connection and loads of different offers and SURPRISES.",2
"I've been with O2 god knows how many years, it's the best for service and in my opinion always has been, my friends are always moaning about Orange or T mobile (now one of the same), as for any others its the same story.They just do not compare to O2.",2
"I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 3 recently and spoke to the Business team (I'm a business customer).The service person i spoke to was very helpful, explained all the tariffs and helped me decide which would be most suitable for my needs.I ordered the iPhone 4 16GB and it was with me the next day, followed by a new sim card and letters explaining the contracts, tariffs etc.Really easy to talk to and they explained everything.Will definitely be upgrading with O2 again",2
Haven't encountered any problems with O2 and I've been with them for many years now.,2
Fantastic customer service.  Ordered a new phone at 3pm and arrived the next morning at 9am.,2
"Had o2 18 month contract, no problems but did find insurance expensive & waste of time to be honest. (£7.50 pm for samsung Tocco Ultra) When phone did break I was told although it was 17 months old it would be covered for repair so didn't have to go through insurance. Other than that, always had good signal & no other complaints",2
After 4 different mobiles and three insurance claims which were dealt with within twenty four hours I can think of nothing but praise for O2.,2
"i used 02 for years, find them brilliant",2
"ALWAYS READY TO HELP ,GREAT TARRIFS AND SERVICE ALSO COVERAGE IS VERY GOOD",2

Any problems have always been dealt with very well and by people who can understand me and I can understand them.  Never had a mysterious lost call when calling customer service.  Signal stength and quality is great for the rural area that I stay in.,2

"GREAT SERVICE NEVER HAD PROBLEM, BEEN WITH THEN FOR AGES. NEED HELP JUST CALL ASK,",2
Very good offers for everybody and for every need!!!,2

what more can you say unlimited text and free o2 to o2 calls for £15 a month plus some minutes better than most contracts,2
"O2 I have been with 7 years, They find me something that meets my needs and are very  efficient.l",2
I have been on O2 now for years and have tried at least 2 of the other big networks and still find O2 as the best. Their bolt ons are superb and their rates are great too. I would never leave this network.,2

Staff in shop and online always there to help,2
Been with the company for over 10 years now and I havent had a single problem with O2. Whenever I have had a problem with my phone or tariff they have sorted it out straight away and even compensated me,2
Sometimes takes a little while to get what you want but generally the service is good,2
this is the best mobile network provider which has reception almost everywhere in northern ireland fantastic,2
I have been with o2 for 8 years and have always had excellent service for my  money.  I get a strong signal almost everywhere in the country and especially in Derbyshire my home county.  I use their broadband and home phone service as well as mobile.  I have used several others for broadband and o2 give the fastest uninterrupted service.  I would recommend an o2 contract to anyone.,2
Simply excellent Service. & good support when there are problems,2
"I changed from T-Mobile to O2 because of the poor reception I received from T-Mobile living on the coast, this despite their assurances coverage would be good. To add insult to injury, providing a poor service still cost me hundreds of pounds to get out of my contract. It's about time the law was changed to protect the customer and not the phone company. O2, no problems with coverage and service.",2
"Out of all mobile suppliers, O2 signal is the best",2
"Never had any problems getting a reception whereever I am excellent service and good pricing, Love it",2
I have used O2 for a few years and find them very good to deal with and do what they say they are going to do.  No problems so far!,2

Been with 02 since 1989 when it was known as cellnet. Never had a problem with the service.,2
"great communication, my bills never have any unexpected charges !! all in all great service !!",2
Always get good signal everywhere and if I have had problems with my phone they have always been delt with promptly. Recently sent Phone to be repaired was back within 1 week. People at O2 who I've spoken to over the phone have always been helpful.,2
I've got a couple of accounts with O2 but with Blackberry handsets.Offered the best deals I could find and service has been first rate.  Dealt with their customer services a few time when looking to upgrade handsets/review accounts and service was first rate.,2
"always have signal, look after existing customers, brill bonus's and extras plus you get priority tickets for gigs!",2
"Best all round network, no hassle good coverage at a whole",2
Was treated as a valued customer not a money making opportunity.,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years and have always found the service and coverage the best.  With the Smart phones I have experienced some problems but these have always been resolved with one phone call, including 24 hour replacement on two occasions.  When talking to Tech Support they have always striven to solve the problem straight away after showing patience and understanding.  Could not ask for anything more.  Support within O2 shops have been first rate also.",2
i have had work phones on other networks that have lost signal and i check my personnal phone only to find i have signal and had had to use my phone to contact my employer. Will never change from o2 its the best,2

MOBILE ARRIVED BY PREMIUM CARRIER VERY QUICK LOADS OF TARRIFS TO CHOOSE FROM AND LOTS OF EXTRA TREATS LOVE THE TEXTS FROM O2 MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL I CAN GET  A CONTRACT  TARRIF ON PAY AS YOU GO WOULD LOVE THIS WITH REPEAT PAYMENT ON CARD BUT NOT CONTRACT,2
I am a novice on mobile phones and needed help and 02 were extremely helpful sorting out and directing me to where I needed to go on their site. Thank you. V. Wells,2
ive had all network over the years and o2 seem to be the best in this area for me,2
On pay as you go.Never had any problems.Excellent,2
We always get a good quality signal unlike other companies that we have tried.When I have needed a repair to my phone it has always been done quickly.,2
"I have been with O2 for many years now, the coverage is exceptional, works wherever I am in the country, they always find the best deal for me, simply have no complaints!",2
"I have been with 02 for years and cannot get a better deal anywhere else.

"have been on o2 since 2003 and would not change for the world, best deals for me, perfect phones and the customer service from o2 is brillient and helpfull.",2
"I have moved my mobile phone and mobile internet to 02 as they are a better company in my opinion. I have tried other networks and i am fed up of them phoning me up at home and on my mobile, they just wont leave me alone. 02 has let me choose what i want to do, what i want to pay, and if i want any help they are there for me on line or in the shops.So thank you 02 for keeping me sane.",2
They have online help guides as well as people online to talk to you about your problems. Have had nothing but good experiences with O2,2
"I have been a customer of o2 for about 6 years and in that time have had no issues with getting service or trying to sort out any questions / problems I have had. Their call centres have always been easy to get through to, and the people at the other end always seem to be helpful.I had a problem with a phone I took when I upgraded back in february, the people in the store were quick to swap the faulty phone, and made sure the new unit was working properly for me.The only thing I would think to mention is that in some cases it is difficult to find the information you need on their website, but as I don't need to access it regularly its not something that I find to be too much of a problem.Overall my experience of o2 has been great, and I would recommend the network to anyone looking for a new provider.",2
I haven't had a problem with them. I like the fact that I can manage my account and email them rather than having to call a call center. They usually phone me back when I email too!,2
"Excellent customer services, plans and even better reception",2

I just love this network.  So easy to use and excellent customer services.,2
"I have been with several different networks in the past but I have found O2 to be the best. Signal coverage is fantastic, great deals, and some great ""perks"" as a customer including access to priority tickets for sports events, gigs, and comedy shows. I recently took out a new contract for an iPhone 4 with O2 and the customer service I received whilst purchasing my phone in store was fantastic it was quick, reliable and very helpful.I can definitely say I won't be changing to any other network after being a customer with O2.",2
I've had an O2 Mobile for a number of years now and until recently I have had a 100% service.I have now switched to t-mobile but if I dont get the service I desire then Im switching back.,2
"I've been with O2 for a couple of years now, and always been happy with the mobile phone side of the business.  When renewing my contract recently, not only did I get a great tariff with the Blackberry that I wanted, but they also offered me a home phone and internet package that was a third of the price of my BT package - and with far superior customer service!",2
never have a problem and when i do they are always there and willin to help :),2
I hav always had exceptional service from O2,2
Both provider of mobile contract and line rental/broadband!,2
"I love O2. Not ony do they have excellent coverage, they also offer top price plans for pay and go and pay monthly AND rewards!I have never had a problem with this provider and always reccomend to everybody.",2
"I am very rarely without a mobile signal and calls very rarely drop.Have had 1 or 2 slight probs with my broadband package, but have been told that was BT rather than O2 - so no faults there!",2
Telephone help and support fantastic!Services provided on their mobile network is faultless,2
we are all on O2 and it works really well.,2
"I HAVE BEEN WITH O2 FOR OVER 20 YEARS WHEN MOBILES WHERE LIKE BRICKS, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD GREAT SERVICE CHEAP TARIFFS AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FREE TO CALL AND VERY HELPFUL VERY GOOD NETWORK COVERAGE.",2
"It generally takes a while but you find the right one in the end.I've been with O2 for close on twenty years now and if I've every had an issue or problem, they have allways sorted it out to my complete satisfaction.R",2
",and there pay as you go tariffs are nice.allways have service never any problems",2

Genuinely helpful and honest customer service. Clear billing and control over my account,2
Been a customer for years great all round service,2
"i have been with o2 for many years when they were originally bt cellnet and have never had any problems. I find them a reliable mobile network with excellent offers for either pay as you go or contract customers, which they update frequently. I would recommend o2 to any of my friends.",2
"Good customer service, calls answered promptly. I live in a rural area and the provide the best reception in my area.",2
"great free stuff on pay as you go, i get free calls and texts to other o2 numbers as long as i top up £10 & surprises gifts to play to",2
"My work phone was on O2 and personal phone on Orange.  In comparison the reception on Orange is awful, lots of dead spots.",2
its all just so easy talking to staff and the free gifts i have no problems with this service,2
i find O2 to have excellent customer service which is important to me as a consumer.  i have never had any problems trying to connect or not being able to get  signal from wherever i am. their pay as you go plans are easy to follow and value for money but their simplicity card is excellent value. i would definately recomend them,2
"i have had a contract with o2 for nearly 3 years. i get great signal anywhere i go, including spots that may other phone networks struggle with.if i have ever had a problem the customer services have always been friendly, helpull, and easy to get hold off on the free call numberthe arent the cheapest network out there but i think for the service they give the couple extra pounds is definately worth it",2
"I have been a customer of  o2 since July 2009 and have found them to be, helpful, informative (especially online help and e-mail feedback) and in general good value for money. Service wise I have only recently had one problem with my 3G availability with my iphone4  and it was dealt with promptly and efficiently.  I was also offered a £5 credit to my account for the loss of service. To be honest this was far better than my previous suppliers!",2
"They offer simply the best deals for my needs and will also grant you freebies and suprises when you top up, depending on the amount you top-up.not a bad word towards o2 they are awesome! :)note: (been with vodafone, orange, 3 and o2. and o2 is by far the best as i have been with them for 6 years now)",2
Never had any complaints and would reccomend to anyone,2
"very good customer help line, helpful clever suggestions. great signal and amazing tariffs.",2
o2 always does what it says it will. I've never had any problems and would like to think I'll have a pay monthly contract with the company for the foreseeable future.,2
"excellent service from o2.. never had an issue with them, best for serivice and deals..",2
"02 are the best Mobile Network I have ever dealt with, I never had to contact them in the 5 years I was with them & only moved company because I got a better deal.Moving to Vodafone was a big mistake, they are pretty useless, never answer the phone, & rude & always seem to magically over charge me every month.I'll be going back to 02 once my contract is renewed. I'm sorry 02!",2
after contracted to the company for years I still happy with the service,2
I can't really comment too much on o2's customer service because I have never had a problem with the service I receive from the company!! The coverage is great.,2
"IVE BEEN WITH O2 FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS NOW. I WOULDNT LEAVE THEM FOR ANYTHING. DEFINATELY THE BEST NETWORK AROUND... FREE TEXTS, FREE CALLS, SUPRISES... WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR...O2 IS GOD",2

"Friendly and effective customer service makes all the difference when you hit problems or need help.  You really notice it when you move to an operator like 3 who seem to practise customer abuse from their offshore call centre - never again, I'm back with O2 and much the happier for it.  Simplicity contracts are great value too, and network coverage is good. What's not to like?",2
Excellent staff. Good customer service,2
"With O2 i havenever had a call cut off unexpectedly and have never been out of range, I will continue to use them as there service is second to none.",2
Great signal in my area and the broadband service is £10 p/m for unlimited upto 20MB broadband.,2
I like em for their good value service,2

"I get unlimited texts and internet on pay as you go every time i top up with £10, these last a month and then i just use my £10 credit- couldn't ask for anything better. It's AMAZING!",2
Two friends have changed to O2 for service and coverage. Transfer made easy and package perfect.,2
Always been very helpful and good value for money.,2
Excellent signal coverage !Superb 3g services !,2
Customer service = GoodValue for money = goodTech support = goodWhat more can you ask!!,2
I do find network coverage is much the same for all mobile operators (except 3 which was v unreliable) but the O2 telephone and online support is first rate. I recently transferred my home and mobile broadband to O2 as well and that was a pain-free experience with great service too.,2
"The best customer service I have experienced for years, you get to speak to a human being located in UK that actually is polite and knows what they are talking about. Very helpful...would never go anywhere else.",2
"Excellent customer service, excellent all over!!!",2
o2 for me are the best mobile company as ive never really been with another apart from orange but i changed from orange to o2 a while back because of the deals they done for example if i was to top up £15 pound a month i would get free text message untill the end of the month also to other o2 callers its cheaper. You also get to put in a code with certain amounts of money you top up the better prizes you would be able to win.,2
"i have 2 contracts and an 02 money card with 02..i have found them to be the best coverage in my area, have the best phones and are always helpful when i need them to bei am seriously considering changing my broadband from BT to 02 also because i like them so much and im kinda loyal like that",2
"I have been with 02 now for 6 years and have never ever hadaq problem with reception, i have a pay as you go phone and they give you rewards for topping up for as little as £10 a month also rewards every 3 months for topping up at all great customer sevice and i will never change.",2
I have always been on O2 for all my life. That says it all really.,2
"Fantastic Customer Service, helpful and polite which is really rare these days, couldnt be more accomodating, i was thinking of leaving as they are not the cheapest but to be honest, i have had no problems so why spoil a good relationship",2
O2 Are simply THE BEST! - Great offers and at low prices!,2
i have now been on o2 for about 4 years and cannot fault them if i have ever had a problem there customer services was always polite helpful and straight to the point there network coverage is second to none and there tariffs are the best out there in my opinion why anyone would select a different service provider is beyond me as o2 provides quality care competative prices and exellent network coverage10/10,2
I have been with most of the other mobile phone service providers and have never had this level of service. When you talk to anyone from o2 on the phone be it a change of priceplan to just general information they are always pleasent and willing to help in anyway.,2
"no complaints at all, bill never excessive and have never had any problems with connections.",2
Fantastic service from O2 staff in quickly locating an iPhone 4 for me. Excellent follow up by the sales person and excellent service from the update service as to availability and locality. O2 are the best for customer service bar none.,2
I recently upgraded to iPhone 4 with O2 and it was the easiest thing I have done. I Love the phone and cannot wait to see the great service O2 will provide me :-),2
I have been with O2 for many a year & have heard some very bad reviews about there customer service. I have just recently upgraded my handset & could not have been treated better. The CS rep was very understanding & knowledgable about the options I had & within 24hrs my new handset was with me.,2
"Whenever i've had a problem i've phoned o2 and it's been sorted out straight away, they are very friendly and helpful. I've been with o2 for about 4 years and wouldn't use any other network.",2
"Have been with this company since my first mobile (back in the days when they were almost as big as bricks) never had any problems either dealing with customer service or with reception on phones, all this and still on pay as you go.",2
"Staff are trained to a very high standard and understand your needs fully, neevr had an issue and always exceeds my expectations time after time, would not hesitate to recomend across all boards, internet, shops, online and via their call centres! 100%",2
"I am very pleased with this network. They allowed me an early upgrade to the new iPhone 4 and gave me an amazing deal along with it.If I ever need to contact them there is always a polite, happy, helpful employee on the other end of the phone willing to help with any problem.Also their network coverage is excellent, I am able to get signal just about anywhere. I always recommend 02 to all of my friends.",2
very helpful all the time! good prices to,2
I am with O2 for last 3 years. I get great reception in any corner of the house where rest of the mobiles give up. Keep up the coverage O2 and get some competitive pricing.,2
"They just cancelled my (unnecessary) phone insurance, at 4pm on a Sunday, within 15 minutes! And refunded me the rest of the month's cost.I've been with them for years for their great service and reception, and they just get cheaper and cheaper",2
Over the years I have left O2 to try other networks (why leave if it's so good? like most people - you think it's a better deal) I always ended up going back to O2 before my contract had even finished.O2 online does some good deals. Recently I moved from Simplicity to a regular 18 month contract and as I was impatient I went into the store to get the phone. O2 then noticed I was normally an O2 online customer and automatically put me back from offline to online.I appreciated that as you get more for your money that way.Only thing I query is why the deals in store can't be the same! But as it doesn't really effect me I won't knock them down!Will never leave O2 for another network ever again - I've learnt that lesson!,2
"Joey was fantastic! She was incredibly helpfuland knowledgeable when I was purchasing my new Pixel 9 Pro XL.  Not only did she patiently answer all my questions and make sure I got exactly what I needed, but she also helped me save money in the process by finding the best deals and promotions. If you're looking for a top-notch salesperson who truly cares about their customers, ask for Joey!",2
"From the moment we were introduced to our advisor Jade, she put me at ease with her warm & friendly greeting & her wealth of knowledge.Jade too her time to provide me with options so I could make informed choices as to what handset suited my needs.Jade took time to explain the plan which includes sim & my device.Such a refreshing experience all round!Would definitely recommend Vodafone & Derby Vodafone shop!!",2
Would like to say a huge thank you to Sonal from the Vodafone Dorking shop for helping me out today! I came in wanting to change plans and she took her time taking me through all the options available for me and helping me pick the right deal. Really friendly and helpful service and wish I had gone into the shop sooner - thank you Sonal !,2
"Mirza was fantastic with all information, guided me very well and I trust his information.He made things clear so I can understand (brain issue) and helped me understand a few things with my phone that I was confused with ..I'm very pleased 😀 to what I thought would be a nightmare to navigate he made it a pleasant experience",2
"Invaluable assistance and knowledge sharing from both Aman and Khurram today in helping me resolve a few security issues. But they got me set up very quickly and helped with my apps so no information lost in swapping back over from Giffgaff. My only small peeve was that I was given the net and not the monthly VAT incl price of the plan which was a bit naughty. But they stayed and helped me back up my phone before the move, so really very happy overall. The service was excellent, very professional and helpful. Cannot recommend enough. You get what you pay for, and I am happy to be paying a bit more for better security.",2
"An experience good enough to write a review.Bilaal took his time to go over a number of different options with me, gave future proofing advice and would highlight the package I most needed, not trying to upsell me on everything but still letting me know what the other, more and less expensive options there were.Price ranges were similar between a bunch of places but the service is why I'm now a customer. Thank you for the informative and patient assistance",2
"Always a pleasure going to Vodafone Elgin and seeing the staff there such as Rennie, Katie, Agnieszka and Dan  who are always helpful and willing to help. Such a shame it's closing due to the center it's in closing, hopefully a new premises is opened soon in Elgin.",2
Today myself & my daughter went in to see about a new mobile phone contract wasn't sure what Samsung deal or phone we wanted.  We were served by Jack who was extremely polite helpful & friendly who explained everything fully to us in detail he was a first rate Vodafone assistant and put me at ease,2
"Well what can I say. Graham at the store in Pontypridd was absolutely outstanding. Went out of his way to solve a problem that wasn’t really his to sort. It was an issue Voxi had created but his passion for great customer service meant that he would not let us leave without getting a solution, despite not being able to verbally talk to anyone on the Voxi team. He spent an absolute age on the webchat with them and finally got the problem escalated to a senior team member who was able to look into how it could be resolved. Good old fashioned customer service is what any customer wants and every shop should have a Graham.",2
"Buddy from The Webchat TeamBuddy was absolutely amazing, helped me with saving money on my contract, and also adding an iPad onto my contract, helped me with every question that I had, and made everything really easy to understand. We chatted and worked things out for over an hour but this really put me at ease, as nothing was rushed. Best service that I have had in the years I have used Vodafone. Anybody would be lucky to be connected with them.",2

"Really helpful staff!Graham solved a problem I had with a frozen screen on my iPhone within minutes and then Ria helped me to upgrade to a new model quickly while Luca provided the best entertainment for my two little ones to keep them busy while I was sorting my new phone and contract. Thank you to you all for being so kind and helpful, much appreciated 🙂",2

Cancelled the new contract and upgraded- better phone, better contract = happier customer! Thanks Tom- superstar!!",2
"A big thank you to Parvez at Vodafone Oldham branch for his excellent service while helping me with my upgrade. His advice on choosing my new device and airplan was brilliant.

Johnny was brilliant today at the Widnes Vodafone store and sorted both my mum and dad out with new sim only deals which is exactly what they were looking for. We will be back when our contract ends and hope that Johnny is there to help us again as it was so quick and easy! He helped us 2 years ago so we were so pleased it was him helping us again this time round.,2
"Today I walked into the store and was greeted by Haz with a chirpy cheerful greeting and some banter to top it off. He then get me paired up with Sam to help me with my phone issues and let me tell you what a great person, super helpful so nice and polite made this store visit such a pleasant experience. This girl has a lot going for her and I wish her the best with her career. Haz over watched the process I opted for and supported his team member with any questions and queries that Sam needed help with. Great team great experience. Well done guys",2
"Back in September, I signed up for Broadband at Vodafone's Dundee Branch. Delays with City Fibre connecting my flat meant that I wasn't connected until early December. However, since this has been done, I have benefitted from really speedy fibre broadband and digital voice communication.Brandon, at the Dundee Branch, was particularly helpful in helping me with the intricacies of Vodafones online customer service.

Sayed and the team were wonderful and went above and beyond to help me after my phone was stolen. The experience was second to none and I left with all the information I needed and my issues resolved on the day.,2
"I needed Vodafone to save me, with 2 weeks left before a big fat 6 months abroad I needed someone to navigate all the phone things I never had the brain to memorise. A Puc vs a Nuc code? What the best deals were to be able to spend data abroad, how to transfer My account to my name from my mums when I was 13. Joshua in the bracknell store was an absolute life saver,  we burdened him with many specific requests and he navigated them all easily and knowledgeably.If you're stuck with phone problems this is this store for you, man went and saved me from years worth of failed robot phone calls, and I no longer have to wait for My retired mother to join me in store to access My account. Wins all around.I'm very satisfied and now very comfortable I never need to know what a NUC or PUC is again, I can simply rely on josh.10/10",2
"I was just shopping with my girlfriend around Oxford Street, and I got my phone stolen at the busy crossroads. I then wanted to get a replacement, and Piotr helped me out straight away!

"I cannot praise Alexei enough for his outstanding service at the Vodafone Winchester store this morning. He was incredibly helpful in assisting me with switching from a different provider to an excellent SIM-only deal with Vodafone.Thanks to Alexei, I now have a £10-a-month plan with 40GB of data, unlimited calls, and texts. I’m absolutely delighted!I did notice a member of staff sitting down who was engrossed in his phone, which some recent reviews have also mentioned. While I understand staff may use their phones for work-related purposes, I would suggest that when a customer enters the store, staff should immediately disengage from their phones, stand up, and warmly welcome them.That said, my experience with Alexei was exceptional. He was professional, patient, and genuinely helpful in making sure I got the best deal. I cannot fault the service I received—thank you,",2

"It's just over 2 months since I switched to Vodafone broadband. They kept me informed prior to the change, on the day the Openreach engineer ( actually a subcontractor from Kelly Communications) was on time, he was polite and friendly, and the new service was up and running before he even left the house. Vodafone even phoned me the following day to check that everything was alright, I was impressed with that.Since then I have been enjoying faultless broadband with only the very occasional couple of seconds dropout, and a constant speed, currently 72.19 Mbps on Ookla (which shows slower speeds than other speed test sites). This is quite adequate for me and it is in fact faster then I got from BT / EE who were ripping me off for double Vodafone's monthly price. I am currently typing this on my laptop in the lounge, the router is upstairs in an office.My only niggle, and it is a very minor one, is that I don't receive any email notification when each month's payment is taken, I have to remember to log in to my online account to see them.",2
