T-Mobile IS the very best mobile service we've EVER had. Always able to reach a live body when you call and no wasted time getting jacked around from one phone prompt to another. Their service works flawlessly when we bounce back and forth to Mexico and Canada. They're doing customer service right!,2
"""I recently switched my phone service from Pure Talk to T-Mobile and had the pleasure of being assisted by Scott Wallace at the Waterville, Maine location. I was incredibly impressed with his professionalism and helpfulness. Scott was extremely knowledgeable about the different plans and patiently answered all of my questions. He made the entire process of switching carriers very easy and stress-free. I highly recommend Scott and the T-Mobile store in Waterville.""",2
"I'm a long time customer (12+ years) so I guess I'm satisfied with their service.  I'm in a plan that they no longer offer, but am able to keep as long as I stay with them, so no price increases, except ""fees"", which is five unlimited lines for under $150/month.  The service itself is generally good as no one on the plan lives in a remote area.  Customer service on their ""800"" number has also been decent overall.  They have moved to offshore agents, but my experience has been decent to very good with them.  Going into their stores is a mixed bag, but never any horrible experiences, though some better than others.Another major carrier has recently offered me new phones + gift card$ to switch, but I'm reluctant to take the bait, at least for now sticking with the ""devil I know"" as opposed to the one I don't know.",2
Kelly Handyman Services LLC led by Brandon & Fabian are true professionals.Their work is top shelf and far above the norm. Do not hesitate do call them as they will deliver superior customer service.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ⭐️,2
I am a 77 yr old woman and I was having problems answering incoming calls. I went to T-mobile store in London Ohio. I received very professional assistance. They were kind and patient with me. I appreciated their service and would recommend this store highly. 614-581-4075. B. Elfrink,2
"Today I visited the T-Mobile store across from Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida.I was greeted with a smile and incredible service that was offered by Brenda. Brenda is new at this location however she has been with T-Mobile for years.Congratulations!",2
"I was having a problem with my phone constantly going to ""do not disturb"" on its own. It wouldn't let me do anything! I finally took it to Edward at the South Haven, Michigan store and he quickly solved the problem! It hasn't given a problem since! (I had an app that took over the phone. He removed it...)",2
"From the very 1st encounter setting up my account I've had nothing but the best customer service. I question everything yet whether I'm on the phone or f2f, they always answer my questions patiently and politely. The customer service reps can ""see"" everything in my account and can address all aspects. I moved from another big mobile company that made my every move to leave as painful as possible. T-mobile helped me and even adjusted my account because I missed a deadline to take advantage of the discounts for moving to T-mobile. I've even used the chat feature (which is traditionally like a torture chamber) and found the people on the chat side actually competent and able to handle my service needs. I've been a customer for quite a while and can say T-mobile has come a LONG WAY in service quality.",2
Shout out to Reggie on the phone for helping me reset my phone after it stopped connecting to my cellular. Works perfect now and he was so helpful thank you REGGIE!!!!!,2
I recently visited T-Mobile in Ridgeland on County Line Road. Customer service was amazing Sanyonette was awesome. She helped me every step of the way getting my new iPhone 15 set up she even applied the screen protector. My billing was completely explained and I encourage everyone to visit this location. And please ask for Sanyonette.,2
I was in town and needed to visit the T-Mobile in Jefferson City Missouri.  I had the pleasure of being serviced by Eriana and Jharyld.  They were extremely professional and courteous.  What warmed my heart was the patience and kindness they treated   3 different elderly customers who each had their special challenges.  My mother is 79 and I know how I want her to be treated.  They both deserve special recognition  and a raise!,2
"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 7 watch through T-mobile about 10 days ago. I love Samsung products because their support team will help you resolve and understand any issue. However, Samsung couldn't help me because the watch kept asking for a PUK (Sim card) number that T-mobile had to give me. Not as easy as it sounds. I called tech support and got CARTER B. who is probably the best customer service representative that I've ever dealt with in my life! At 70, that's saying lots! CARTER B. could hear my frustration, just as much as I thought he was stumped. The difference? I gave up, he didn't. He researched, and researched more, and after 2 hours said he'd call me back shortly, with an answer, and again reassured me it was all going to be fine. Through the hours he spent tirelessly on the phone with me, he never sounded angry, frustrated, sick of me whining, or anything other than supportive and dedicated. He would not let me go until I felt like I was confident in myself to understand my watch. He is amazing, patient, respectful, intelligent, kind and the best customer service representative ever! I've ran many huge corporations during my working career and I would've been honored to have him represent me/my company. I hope T-mobile realizes what a gem he is, because this young man is going to make any company where he works a success! High 5 CARTER B!!! Let's give CARTER B. the standing ovation he very much deserves!",2
"It's weird that T-Mobile isn't rated much higher here. I won't ditz the other cell phone carriers I've used because it's in poor taste, but I will sing T-Mobile's praises. Definitely a superior brand! As a rule, they hire nice people, and their tower network performs exceptionally well.CAVEAT: If you want a bargain basement price, you'll need to bring your own unlocked phone and sign up for one of the ""Connect by T-Mobile"" plans. (All the plans that include a free phone cost much more.)",2
"I read some of the reviews and have never experienced anything like the complaints. T-Mobile gives people extensions, not only that they offer to split the late bill in two. It is not their fault people don't know how to budget. I have always had a great customer service experience and I have had gone T-Mobile everything even down to the bank account. I love T-Mobile because they have the best customer service people ever.",2
"Katia helped me today to choose a new phone plan and to port my current number over to the new plan.  It took a lot of her time but she still was patient, very courteous and helpful. She methodically went through all my questions explaining everything carefully.  I highly recommend the woodland shop should you need to get a new service. Not only were the other workers helpful as well but Eric even suggested a better deal than  I initially had in mind when I entered the store  Don’t hesitate to use their service. You won’t be disappointed.",2
"On Sat. Nov. 30, I went to the T-mobile store on Twenty Mile Road, in Parker, because my phone (bought from a local retailer) wasn't holding a charge.I had gone to Batteries Plus earlier in the day, who said the battery was no good.They said a new battery would be around $80.00. The phone was old, & was purchased new for $90.00 2 years ago.  It wasn't worth replacing the battery.When I went to T-mobile, I was met by 2 gentleman, who couldn't have been more understanding, gracious and eager to help!They both worked together on my phone to get it to charge. It would charge to 15, then drop to 2 once the charging cable was removed. The same issues I was having at home.Kway went out of his way to find me a phone I could comfortably afford; then he worked diligently to transfer my old phone information to the new phone,  which wasn't easy, since a phone needs to reach 20% to transfer.With his efforts, and his amazing knowledge of cell phones, he was able to transfer all of my contacts, as well as very important apps I'd saved in the old phone!I've been with T-mobile since they were Voicestream (30+ years?) and again,  realized last night that I've made the correct decision to stay with them, even though MANY companies have tried to lure me away with 'cheaper' plans!Thank you Kway AND T-Mobile....",2
"Daniel at the Ferndale Washington location helped me out with some functionalities with the auto pay as we'd experienced some fraud issues with our last credit card...just overall helpful without attitude, I don't live on my phone it's still only a tool for business. Daniel and his colleague Andrew were awesome, friendly...no hassles, just great service!!!!",2
I’ve been with T-Mobile for 17 years and am blown away by these comments. I’ve zero issues but I never miss a bill. I had gotten payment arrangements maybe twice with no problems. I love using their service and have used Verizon and sprint as well. I use customer service maybe 5-8 times a year and never once did I not get something resolved. I hate that everyone’s having issues….,2
I recently spoke to a CS Rep Melisa and she was professional. She handled my concerns and questions and helped me make an informed decision. Very pleasant and glad I got her when I called support.,2
"T-mobile upset me a lot and I would normally give them a one star but on the other side, I must say that they have sometimes outstanding people that are genuinely concerned about your problem and they help you, understand the issue and so extremly professional like the one I spoke today. His name is Axel. He was the best so far. Because of him, I will give T-Mobile a 5*. That’s how good he was! I will give them a 5*.",2
"I've been a T-Mobile customer for many years, most of which have been excellent. Unfortunately, I had to choose a different service recently, but T-Mobile customer service was excellent even when I was switching carriers. I'll be back for sure when circumstances permit!",2
"Coming from a $500 bill with Verizon Wireless, down to $207 with T-Mobile is incredible! I have been treated like a valuable customer since day one. No company is perfect. No company is trying to be perfect either. I appreciate the way T-Mobile has handled my business.",2
"I went to T-Mobile to change my plan and I encountered a terrific sales person by the name of Luis Astorga, Store 7532.   Not being a tech savvy person, Luis helped with through every facet of setting up my cell phone with extreme patience and sensitivity.    Luis went above and beyond what I  expected.   Great, great customer service.",2
"Great home internet and very reliable!  Left Xfinity after several issues with reliability and price changes.  Couldn't be happier!  I cut my internet price in half and have faster speeds!  Price is locked in so no worry about paying more a year later.  We recently had an ice storm and Xfinity was down in the area, heard all the complaints over Facebook on Xfinity, mine was running strong!  Glad I made the change, no issues hear and happy to be a cusomer!",2
"I am very thankful that Barbara G (Customer care) guided us patiently what to do and helped us to reach out  to the right T mobile store for help. The T-Mobile store in Desoto(851 I35 east) is very helpful especially Bryce and another lady. They were very patient and Bryce spent more than half an hour helping us to activate my new iPhone. Therefore, I want to say a big ""thank you"" to these lovely people.",2
I would like to give a huge shoutout to my local team of customer service reps especially Josh. We are very grateful for the assistance you provided in resolving the 3 month ongoing issues that really had us in a bind. T-mobile remains #1 in customer service because of you brother. We cannot thank you enough!,2
T-Mobile Store #4139(144 Moreland Ave ) Had the most Genuine and Outstanding customer service thus far. Hollis & Keem did a great job helping me and was very knowledgeable about their work. I salute their GREAT customers service and helping one another out. I will come back to this one. Thank You Guys,2
"I was literally at my wit's end and ready to break down and cry.  An update locked my phone (I had never locked it, therefore no password set up to unlock).  After being on another phone for 5 hours trying to get help, I was told repeatedly I would have to do a factory reset and lose everything.  I did the reset, but Samsung wanted to text me a code to unlock the reset, but no text messages could get through.  I took the phone to the Princeton, Texas T-Mobile store, and Pedro had personality plus, but he also had lots of knowledge and got my phone operative.  Then he restored all my contacts, photos, and calendar.  Super kudos to Pedro.  You definitely deserve a raise!",2
"We had a great experience switching from Verizon to T-mobile at the North Ridgeville Ohio store on Center Ridge Road. Chris was our salesman and was very knowledgeable and helpful. We were given a lot of the promotions and discounts going on. The manager Brian was also very helpful and friendly     We also got the internet special and love it. It works great in our home on all of our tvs, computers, tablets etc. I would recommend them highly. They made the switch of 3 phone lines very easy.",2
"This review is for Rej (Reg?). Thank you for your amazing customer service. I had trouble with data connection and issues with my phone, on top of that, my old phone was shutting down and I was unable to use it. Rej provided outstanding customer service and was really kind, empathetic, and professional. Thank you for all your help and assistance!💫🌸",2
I traveled recently and had an amazing experience with the data and connection in other countries with my T-Mobile service. It helped so much! I used to have sprint and traveled at that time and the connection wasn't good at all so this was a huge relief. I tried to file a compliment with T-Mobile but couldn't find an option online so I'm writing the review here.,2
"Minus 2It's disappointing that you must give at least one star to write the review, when you really deserve a minus two. I'm escalating my complaint to a state representatives office because T-Mobile won't cancel a bill. I've tried the phone(twice), I visited the store to verify who I am, and still two months later I'm still receiving a bill.I hope everyone reading this will also send a notice to their congressional representative as I think T-Mobile is using us to pad profit numbers before quarterly reports are due...an illegal practice.It's absurd, but your state representative lives in your area and would love to uncover such a scandal. This is what they do and they are able to help. If you've had a billing problem with T-Mobile, please reach out to your representative's office to discuss the issue (It's what they are there for).",2
"We were greeted by a lovely sales rep yesterday to help us purchase our new telephones She was very informative and helpful in transferring the information from our old phones to the new ones which took a very long time because our previous co was not very helpful.She was very kind considerate and very knowledgeable. Also, very patient T Mobile of Southern Pines NC is very lucky to have her as an emplyee",2
"I went into a T Mobile store on 4000 West and around 4500 South in West Valley City, Utah.  I was immediately helped with some help on setting up a new phone and also helped me get a galaxy watch.  The two employees helped me for a long time to understand how the phone and galaxy watch worked.  Their names are Anderson and Jasmine.  I highly recommend this store to anyone needing a new phone or help with their equipment.",2
My wife and I stopped in to a T-Mobile at 5011 Meadowood Mall in Reno and had the best experience ever. Naomi B. was are T-Mobile expert whom assisted us; she answered all are questions and helped through several issues we were having. Thanks Naomi! -Keith and Rebeca,2
"Hi I had a few questions to ask of Tmobile and gave them a 5 star rating! The gentleman that I spoke with is Aliz, he was so professional at helping me with my question! Aliz provided me with best representative service today! Aliz was so sweet and he cared and you can't find that anywhere anymore! Even when I'm having a bad day and need assistance from Tmobile about a promotion or whatever the case may be I can always count on them to put me in a good mood with there cheerfulness and positive attitude that I always experience with Tmobile representatives. Whatever there doing keep it up, I used to ask if they all do a happy dance before there shift starts lol!         Sincerely,Brittany S",2
"Somehow my phone had gotten a virus on it as I had been told by a cell phone repair shop.  I was told to remove all pictures, passwords & any thing that I wanted to keep from losing before he did a Factory Reset on it. I did as directed other than saving my contacts which got lost !! I decided to go in to T-Mobile in Lithonia, Ga. and Tyniah who is a Manager there was the one that was able to retrieve every thing that I needed !!!!  She is very good at her job and was very friendly while working on my phone.",2
"I needed help with my home internet, and the app wasn't working, so I was told to go to a store.  I went to store number 5GSP in Stow, Ohio.  The personnel there were friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  I was able to obtain quick service.  Good job!",2
"Lawrenceburg, TNThis is the absolute best customer service from t mobile I've had in 15 years. Literally the only positive experience I've had in that time. Thank you to Trevor and Alex. You need something from t mobile in TN this is the spot to go to no cap",2
Arian @ T-Mobile was by far the most helpful and patient king of all times. He helped us to much and listened to our technical issues. Great experience. Not a lot of representatives are like him. He’s one of a kind.,2
"The customer service for TMobile internet has been absolutely fantastic. Our internet has been wonderful since we switched from our previous company (Spectrum). Also when I got stuck setting up my online account today, Robert, was a huge help in setting up my online account. Thank you Robert for the wonderful customer service that you provided!",2
"T-Mobile needs to promote their Trustpilot, it’s a shame it’s filled with such negative reviews. I’ve had nothing but great experiences with T-Mobile USA. I’ve been a customer for close to 14 years now. My family of 4 is on the Magenta Military Max plan. We have a free 4th line, so we pay next to nothing per line. We’ve all used our phone service for free while roaming internationally, it has been a life saver. We’ve also all used the free in-flight WiFi. Most recently I flew to Ireland and had free WiFi from T-Mobile for the whole flight over the Atlantic! I personally believe T-Mobile has the best phone plan currently available on the postpaid market, and has had the best plan for nearly a decade now!",2
I got help at TMobile that is located at 1818 3rd Ave.  Great Falls I have had T-Mobile coverage for my phone for several years but just got internet coverage today.  I was very satisfied with Jonny's help.  I was having difficulty changing my internet on my computer but he got me up and running!! I would give the whole store a 10!,2
"T mobile Prescott Pkwy lakes, my dog chewed up my phone,screen shot!

He gets my vote!!!!!! C J",2
"This morning, while accompanying my sister to the hospital lab, I discovered that my cell phone was missing upon my return. I promptly visited the T-Mobile store located at 235 N Citrus St, Ste B in West Covina, where I received assistance from Mason McGee. With Mason's guidance, I was able to quickly locate my phone using a map, and discovered that it had been left under a chair in the hospital waiting area. I express my gratitude to Mason for his exceptional help in retrieving my phone.",2
Clair is very patient and helpful! She’s indeed five star,2
"I'm so excited about the 5- star service received by Sir Cartier at the Crossroads location in Terrell, Texas. I wish more employees at Tmobile would follow Cartier's lead of Good Service.",2
"I have been with T-Mobile for seven years. Part of that was with sprint, and the service has always exceeded my expectations. The employees are well-versed on all the devices, including my iPhone and iPad and T-Mobile Internet. I shop at Sams Club in Grand Prairie and find that there T-Mobile set up is very convenient very friendly and helpful. I am working with GG and James Jordan (upgrading my devices)who’s always been very professional and friendly. I like going to these Satellite T-Mobile spots as they can answer all my questions in a timely matter and I don’t have to wait in line like I do at some of the T-Mobile stores and if there is a line, I can always do my shopping and when I come back, they are ready to answer my questions. The main reason I’m sticking with T-Mobile is there pricing and plans ….and I  know that the people that work at T-Mobile at Sams Club know their stuff and take care of me as well as hundreds of other customers and  BUSINESS Customers that shopped there on the daily basis.AJ SNACKS",2
I recently activated my WiFi service with T-Mobile.I visited Bufrod store and met Jeff RussoJeff is extremely friendly knowledgeable and explains in easy language.7 STAR for Jeff,2
I love mobile. I've been a customer for so long back whenever they were altell as well. I've never had an issue other than when the towers are down but the once in a blue moon and what services don't have that happen. 🙂🙂,2
"I went to the T-Mobile store in Hyannis, MA. My cell phone died 3 weeks before and I was caught in the middle between the insurance company and the repair facility (who ended up closing their doors). When my claim was approved, someone suggested we say goodbye to our current carrier and go with T-Mobile. We're so glad we did. Michael is great to deal with. He thoroughly explained our options. When we decided to go with T-Mobile he spent time with us to set up our phones. Since our initial dealings with Michael, we've been back to the store for a couple of things we had a hard time figuring out and the staff that helped us was great. We really appreciate the staff in the Hyannis location and highly recommend them. Thank you to Michael and the team!",2
"I have had the worst experience EVER joining T-Mobile about 6 months ago. It started out awful with the very first phone I got, then our bill was being raised every month without our knowledge then they charged us several fees for no reason. The reason I am giving them 5 stars is because today after 6 months of dealing with this nightmare I finally got Carrie Mary as a customer service rep who was able to fix my bill, lower it to an amazing $100 a month, she has been monitoring my bill for me so that this never happens again and I am FINALLY satisfied with my T-Mobile experience thanks to her. Without meeting her then I would have changed carriers that day. All other customer reps simply wanted to “look into it and give me a call back” which never happened.",2
"I had the BEST experience with T-Mobile!!!! My mother recently joined and I wasn’t convinced to follow until I talked with customer service representative from Maine, Galin. I was barely interested in joining and was not planning on buying a new phone or joining T-Mobile until my mother called and asked about the services and phones. Galin was so happy and enthusiastic to help us with this and walk us through pricing and plans. He was so so funny and so very helpful. I’ve never had a phone service be so informative. I had the best customer service experience and I hope I can always get help like this again. If not, get help from Galin again!! Thank you for hiring such an amazing spirit! I really hope this reaches T-Mobile, we’re doing the other survey as well because he was just that good!! Thank you Galin!!",2
"I had the best experience on my phone call today with Zoe! I had bad service with my first attempt to fix the issue I was having and was told they couldn’t and wouldn’t help me. I gave it another try today and Zoe helped me and solved my problem, after I was told they couldn’t do anything,I called again today and spoke with  Zoe who helped me so much today and did such an amazing job! Thank you Zoe you were amazing!!",2
"I have had phone and internet service with T-Mobile for 3 months now. I couldn't be any happier with them. I wen from not being able to use Comcast phone or 1 bar to 5 bars at almost all times. The internet service is just as good and I actually have faster download speeds. I can't say enough about how much I enjoy my T-mobile service, and I am saving $80.00 a month.",2
"Taylor Smith from the Tallahassee FL location, specifically Apalachee Pkwy, Suite 13, was a life saver!  He went above and beyond to assist me.  Thank You Taylor!!",2
"I recently purchased a phone and plan at T-mobile in Alabaster Alabama. Benny Alvarado was awesome. He was so helpful and very nice. I was originally told they didn’t have the phone I wanted so I reluctantly chose another phone I didn’t like as well since I didn’t have time to wait on a phone to be shipped. Benny went in the back and found one last phone of my choice hidden in the back. He had so much patience when I couldn’t remember my different passwords and had to restart set up twice. He was kind and very courteous during the whole process. I love my service, plan and internet. I would highly recommend this company and this employee",2
I have been extremely happy with service and pricing.  Everything I was promised was delivered. Easy to reach customer service and every time my issue was resolved to my satisfaction,2
12/28 at around 8:15pm. Just want to let you know that the customer service II received was just Fantastic. I just wanted to let you know ☺️ the individual was experienced and was very helpful in straightening out my bill that I was VERY VERY NOT HAPPY with when I went online to see my Bill. Keep up the Good work with your experience workers. Thank you 👍 keep up the 😊 Good work!!,2
Went to T-Mobile and Jose Z help me with my phone problem. I couldn’t update some apps. He spent less than a hour to update my phone change my screen cove. He is very professional and easy to talk to. I would recommend anyone that uses T-Mobile to go visit Jose Z at the quarry. He’s awesome!,2
"My family and I went to TMobile on Centerville Rd because of a phone issue. Scott and Harry were the best! Both were so helpful and knowledgeable about the products, the promotions the bill, etc. they really took their time to explain things to us and help us find the best plan for our family. I would HIGHLY recommend this store to everyone. Great customer service!!",2
"I often find it challenging to connect with the new generation, as our perspectives differ significantly. Nevertheless, I had a positive experience with Niko and Kimberly, employees at the T-Mobile store located at 2605 Woodland Blvd, Deland, while upgrading my iPhone from a 12 to a 16. Lacking familiarity with the latest smartphones, I was grateful for Kimberly's exceptional patience and understanding. Throughout the phone transfer process, both Niko and Kimberly kept me engaged and informed about T-Mobile's current options and promotions. They took the time to review my account and provided a brief tutorial on the new features of the iPhone 16, even after store hours, without making me feel rushed. Their professionalism and support made a significant difference, and I truly appreciate their contributions to T-Mobile.",2
"Just finished at the store in Elk Grove Village. The CS rep Jordan, was awesome.  He handled several customers as the only employee. The time it took to help everyone was amazing. Thank you, Jordan.",2
"Brandon from the staples Store T-Mobile was very knowledgeable, and very helpful. He programmed my phone, because I had no idea what I was doing. Very good customer service and I will refer my friends to this store. Thanks Brandon.",2
"I've been with the same cell phone company for over 30 years until last week.  I went into Store 5121 NC Hwy 42, Garner NC.  The manager of the store was so impressive with her knowledge base.  Her name is Jamillah B.  I thought I'd never leave my cell phone company, but after hearing what T-Mobile had to offer and the fact that I saved almost $70 a month with new plan, I was force (by common sense) to say bye-bye to the former company!  Of course, they were sorry to see me leave after being a loyal customer for so long, but it was time.  I'm elated, glad and overjoyed with my choices.  I have NO complaints and love the money I'm saving!  Thanks again Ms. Jamillah.",2
"We recently had the pleasure of working with Uriel and Abas from T-Mobile, and we cannot speak highly enough of the outstanding service they provided. They helped us transfer our phones and internet to T-Mobile, guiding us through all the necessary steps with professionalism, respect, and thoroughness.What really stood out to us was how knowledgeable and efficient they were. They took the time to explain everything in detail and answered all of our questions, making the process of switching over seamless and stress-free. Not only that, but they also helped us save a significant amount of money each month, which we are extremely grateful for.Overall, my husband and I highly recommend Uriel and Abas and the T-Mobile team to anyone looking to switch over to T-Mobile. Their exceptional service truly made a difference, and we are thrilled with our decision to work with them. Thank you, Uriel and Abas, for your outstanding work!",2
"I have been a Sprint/T-mobile customer for 18 years. I had been having issues with my phone, dropping calls, never had this problem before. Called spoke with T-mobile Customer Technical Support (Jasmine). She is amazing, she tried a few things and stated she would call me back later than evening to see if it worked. As promised she called me back, I explained to her that I was still having issues. She asked if I would take the phone to T-mobile so that they could change the sim card, she also explained additional options. Again, Jasmine stated that she would call me back in a day to see if it was resolved. As promised she called and I explained to her that I was still having issues. Jasmine then stated there's one more thing I want to try, and it actually worked. She was so professional, courteous, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and would not give up until my issue was resolved. Thank You Jasmine.",2
"I went to the new TMobile store on 418 HWY 70 West in Havelock yesterday around 11, rightafter they opened.  The 3 employees had the best attitude,  smiles on their faces and were very kind and helpful.  You don’t find that a lot any more. Rarely.  I told them it was the best T Mobile experience I have ever had.",2
"There ad is correct! Ordered Home Internet, received at front door in 2 days and had set up under 15 minutes. Was able to connect my two TV’s, echo dot,  tablet and phone. So far so good!",2
Always had really good service with them. Switched to AT&T and that was a joke. So went back to T-Mobile. I’m surprised to read all these bad reviews. The only I want to request from T-Mobile is that they have the same promo as Verizon. Ya know trade in any phone any condition and get the iPhone 15 on them. I rrrreally don’t wanna go with Verizon. But right now it seems that’s the only way I can get a new phone.,2
"I worked with Meli at T-Mobile customer care support and must say it was the most positive experience I've had through their call center. I generally go into the stores for resolution but in this case, Meli was incredibly patient, empathetic and definitely in troubleshooting mode and determined to get to the bottom of my inquiry. We have NOT always had the greatest customer care experience w/ T-Mobile (over the phone) but if Meli is any indicator, things have certainly improved exponentially! Kudos to her!!!!!!",2
Nicole was very helpful and polite with all of my questions and comments. Was very easy to have a conversation and to get all the information needed in a timely fashion. Great customer service and worker,2
"Had a new phone set up.  Way over my head.  Arty made it a simple and enjoyable process.  Very focused with a side of humor.  Thanks Arty in Edgewater, Colorado.",2
I switched to T-Mobile from AT&T in July 2024 for my iPhone only. I chose Go5G Next. The same plan is designed for Yearly upgrades. This left my Android phone on my family's AT&T.This means I have to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max in September 2024 to start my iPhone Yearly Upgrade. It would be an iPhone upgrade from my iPhone 14 Pro Max.,2
"I recently transferred 4 lines from Verizon to T-Mobile. I have to say, my experience with T-Mobile so far has been fantastic! I've had several reasons to contact T-Mobile customer service during the process (billing, phone reimbursement, etc). Outside of an hour plus waiting for their tranfer department, contacting customer service has been very responsive and pleasant. The whole process has been seamless. Several years ago I went through the same process transferring from Visible to Verizon. Verizon was an absolute nightmare! I literally spent 30+ hours chatting and on hold trying to resolve the myriad of issues they couldn't seem to get corrected. Kudos to T-Mobile for their excellent customer service in an age when everyone else is sacrificing quality service for a buck.",2
"I’m very happy with the phone and a deal I received for my new iPhone 13. The gentleman John was very thorough. Very knowledgeable of his work . Great customer service at the T-Mobile store in Manor ,Texas.",2
"I sent this via email to the CEO (update:  Mike replied and indicated that he appreciated my email.  He will reward those who helped me.  He was very concerned about the overall low rating of t mobile on Trustpilot.  He will look into this).Mike,This is written to show my deep appreciation for the three amazing employees who made my day, my week, and perhaps my year.  I am not exaggerating.  I was a customer of your competition and I went into your store because I wanted to get a good deal on mobile phone service.  Your team took the time to get me a great deal, patiently educated me on how to move from my current provider over to T Mobile.  The process was not quick and in fact it took over two hours to complete the process of moving two phones to the T Mobile system and eventually moving all of my data from my old phones to the new iPhone 15 models.The district manager was present and offered me a great deal on internet and a land line. He even told me that the price for service would never change.  Incredible.Please extend a thank you to this great team of employees.  They are Anthony, Lorenni, and Yassine.  They work at the store in Exton, PA at the Main Street shopping center.I find that the best way to keep great employees is to show your appreciation.  As the leader, you set the example.  Do the right thing.Thank you for taking the time to read this.Sincerely,Jeff DavidsonSatisfied customer since today... Keep it that way!Jeffrey A. Davidson, Ph.D.CEO, Alpha Kappa Statistics, LLC267.400.0219  |",2
Love T-Mobile!! Been with them over 2 yrs and never had a problem. Great customer service each and every time. Great coverage and they have a great internet...,2
"T - Mobile is a brand used by the mobile communications subsidiary of the German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom AG. The brand is active in Austria (under the subsidiary T-Mobile Australia. T-Mobile is the best network so far for me, am satisfied with the fast your loyal customer base is outstan empathy towards customer problems, i strongly recomend it. services lately.",2
"5 star for Amir and Ashley of T-mobile in. 405 West Genesee St., Camillus NY.  Excellent service. Thank you guys.",2
"Yesterday I went to the T-Mobile store at the Eastview Mall in Victor New York. I needed a new phone as my old one had charging issues. Sheshe was the woman who helped me out with my new phone. She didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need and she saved me a lot of money by having me trade my old phone in.  I was in the store for quite a while, but I didn't mind. Sheshe helped me out while working with others that came in. Her and her co-worker Tanya were polite and knowledgeable. Sheshe  was even polite to the irate man who kept coming back in because he didn't know what he was doing but was blaming everything on the woman that had finished her shift and left (personally I would have decked the guy). I have nothing but good things to say, my new phone is great and getting it was nothing less than enjoyable.",2
Great service right to the point Jose was very helpfull!!!,2
"All carriers have flaws, but T-Mobile has THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you’re at work, they’ll help you through text!!  Everyone has problems with internet, but not all carriers put as much effort into helping customers as T-Mobile. These poor ratings must be old ones, as it’s not fair when I’ve had the best experience ever with customer service!",2
Chose T-Mobile because of the 5G coverage in my area. (Verizon and ATT maps show coverage but in reality don't exist. Verified with MVNO sims.) After using spotty MVNO online services it was a pleasure to walk into a T-Mobile store and sign up. I have had service for a year with no problems at all. I am on autopay and that works without a problem.,2
"I can’t rave enough about customer service at the T-Mobile store in the Milford Ct Post Mall! Sherman was amazing! I had several issues with 2 separate products and he worked patiently with me on both! Outstanding personality, he was an absolute pleasure to work with! Also the entire crew Kristopher and Steven were extremely helpful as well! Thank you gentlemen for making my hate of going to the Mall a pleasure!",2
"Had a great experience when purchasing a new phone.  Genesis,  the sales professional who educated me and gave me many options to choose from was awesome! Refreshing to meet a 20somthing who is driven and overwhelmed me with information! T-mobile will loose her soon because she is unique.  Go see her if you need a phone ASAP.",2
"A person on my account was in a pickle tonight and needed the recent call info on his line.  So easy-peasy to get to this kind of information - in fact, ANY information you need about your phone service.  Also, if I had needed to call for assistance the local team for our region is terrific and will stay with you through any issues pertaining to your phone and phone service.  I've been a customer for 20 years and wouldn't switch for anything.  This may sound solicited - it's not!  Of all my ""utility"" and ""communications"" services I rate T-Mobile  ""best of class.""",2
"On Saturday, 20 August at 1:30 p.m., my wife and I went to T-Mobile store located on Laclede Station Road in Webster Groves, MO.  We had purchased Smart Phones from T-Mobile in 2019, and had a few questions about operating and updating.  A gentleman there named ""Ron"" spent at least a half hour answering our questions and suggested ways for us to get better use out of our phones.  He was most gracious and nice, and extremely smart, and we left T-Mobile well-informed, more comfortable with our phones, and ready to upgrade with T-Mobile next year.  He was not pushy at all, and we definitely will be dedicated T-Mobile customers from now on out.  Thank You, Ron!  The McCormicks of Saint Louis, MO.",2
Great customer service from Kelly at the Brooklyn Center location she’s beyond expectations,2
"Sharnael was amazing!!! 6/7/2022 at 4p.m. she was not only polite and went above and beyond, but was very professional and patient. She addressed all my concerns. She needs a bonus/raise because she was just amazing. It took an hour in total but because of her going beyond. Thank you!",2
I went in the other day to purchase a new phone from T-Mobile at Rialto location. Let me say the experience went so well. Stephany was the one who helped me the whole way through. I was going back and forth undecided of which phone to choose. I appreciated that she had great patience with me. And I can say I am very happy of my choice. Thank You Stephany- Thank You T-Mobile.  THXS Robt.,2
"On 2-15-22 and 2-16-22 I went to the T-Mobile store #339D, 1481 NJ-23 Unit STE 7, Butler, NJ 07405.  I met 3 employees: Ahnaf, Rami and Brenda.  I was completely overwhelmed  by the outstanding customer service by Ahnaf, Rami and Brenda.  They were very friendly, courteous and their knowledge was at the highest level.  They took care of all my telephone needs and service!  Thank you!",2
TATI @ T-Mobile store 3266 John young parkway @ loop in Kissimmee Florida was amazing from beginning to end very professional and got us exactly what we were looking for. She told us of promotions which we got! Excellent customer service skills! Thanks Tati! Pamela and Jesus,2
Thomas had to be the best we ever had at the Butler Store. We need him to stay. He was the best!!!,2
"T-Mobile expert Darius, Ashburn, VA was very helpful, efficient, knowledgeable and professional in helping me out with phone connectivity issues. This was after being turned away from the T-Mobile Leesburg, VA store and told that I had to contact T-Mobile via their help line. Stay away from T-Mobile Leesburg store. Driving 12 minutes further is worth the service.",2
Hi to T-mobile from Miramar PKWY I would like to say the representative by the name Audra Jerguson she really is at the right place because she loves her job she is so Professional too helpful too kind she it's so good the she take her extra time to explain every detail so when I left the store OMG I was so happy with the service so Professional thanks T-mobile for having on employees like AUDRA JERGUSON on very happy  with the new service I had at T-mobile thanks 😊,2
"I purchased a new Cat 22 flip phone a few days ago. I had an issue with the talk to type feature and the screen would not switch between portrait and landscape. My large hands and the small screen made texting impossible without these features. Colby , one of the reps at the T Mobile store on Maugens Ave. in Hagerstown fixed both issues in minutes after the rep in Waynesboro, Pa. T Mobile  and the on line chat people for T mobile didn't have a clue what to do. The young man deserves a raise in pay.",2
"I personally don't know or understand what All this talk about TMoble Not providing Excellent support. We have been with Sprint for over 24 years now with the TMoble merger and have received 😀 the most Amazing service from TMoble/Sprint customer service staff,  both located her in the USA & offshore. Very Special Personal understanding of our needs. Spectacular Service.",2
"I just upgraded my to the iPhone 13 and had several issues getting the phone to work properly. I went to two store and chatted with online tech support for over two hours. I went to two stores and no one was either willing or able to help me.  The very last store I went into was in Rosemount, MN and David fixed my phone in under 5 minutes.  It really boils down to people and training.  Thank you David!",2
"Compared to Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile has been a breath of fresh air. Their support people seem to be located in the United States, they actually know how to fix and deal with issues, and they're friendly.  T-Mobile's 5GUC service is blazing fast and free of issues and problems.  The billing and online portal from T-Mobile absolutely blows away Verizon's portal; T-Mobile's portal is simple, intuitive and concise, where Verizon's is a bloated mess that is always broken.",2
"customer service  is horrible, changed from sprint to T mobile  when sprint merged with T-Mobile incorrect billing and charges, I am the account holder , they are charging my brother eventho i pay the billing , extremely frustrate, called called customer service over an hour wait, still on hold, considering hanging to another carrier, really frustrated with the amount of time wasted",2
"At first, it was rocky, but now it is an excellent gateway.  My speed is around 500 Mbps at 6:00 PM, high traffic time of day.T-Mobile bandwidth allows me to work from home and participate in video conferencing meetings.  I added a TPLink mesh router to support the T-Mobile gate through my home.",2
I have nothing but good things to say about Tmobile. I even switched my parents  over and they are saving over $60 a month! They also both got a free phone and costumer service was excellent  helping them set up their new phones . That says a lot since my parents are 80 years old.Almost all my family is using Tmobile  and we are all happy with our serviceThank you Tmoble!Keep up the great customer service!!!,2
After 11 different people I spoke to through Sprint and T-Mobile I finally got someone that I could understand and also that he knew what he was talking about. His name was Tony and he saved the day. He was very polite he explained everything thoroughly and I really appreciate him and the time he took for my daughters phone.,2
"I can't speak for other locations but for me, the T-Mobile store located at 4825 Stone Mountain Hwy, Lilburn, GA has gone beyond my expectation with setting things right, communicating what's happening during each step of the process, and providing the necessary follow-up when there is a delay. Perhaps this store and its employees are the templates that should be duplicated.",2
I needed a phone. I got good service and got what I wanted . I don't like passwords on my phone so Juan took the password off for me and gave me my senior discount and a cheaper plan. Juan was nice and explained different options I could get.,2
"I am a fan of T-Mobile, they are by far one of the best mobile services I've had. However, I wish they would put up a tower in my area (Rainelle, WV) they have a site location here, and I get great network service at the store because they have a booster. I don't get good enough network coverage where I live, only about a mile from their store. My sync up drive will not update until you drive at least 30 minutes out of town. The home internet is unavailable to me because they are waiting for a tower to be put up. But other than that, I love the deals/promotions and features T-Mobile offers!",2
UPDATE!!!!!T MOBILE MADE IT RIGHT AGAIN!!!!I have been with TMobile for almost 18 years and things were great until now. A representative offered me an additional line on my plan for $0 per month so I purchased an additional phone and added it on only to find that they are now charging me $30 per month for that line. Many calls and escalated up to managers and they are telling me their rep was new and wrong to offer that deal and they refuse to fix it. The old bait and switch. Looks like it’s time to switch.,2
"I recently visited the T-Mobile store located on Flagler and 100th Ave.  Miami.   I must say that I’m extremely satisfied with the attention and help received particularly from the Manager, but also the rest of the staff.  I hesitated before going given the reviews some people write, but in my case, and from comments made by regular customers there, I’m extremely happy I did business with them.",2

That's why sir you deserve 10 stars .thank you sir for your srevice.",2
"Jorge C. 13073 obt. 32837 October 6th gave me the individual  attention  that made me feel special. Set up my new phone, made me feel like the transfer of phones was smooth..

"I recently went into a new store at Battle Ridge Pavilion, Powder Springs Rd, Marietta, GA 30064.  I am not a customer but just needed help getting a new case on my iphone.  There were 3 employees there and each one greeted me with a smile and assistance!  I was impressed. Good job, guys!!",2
I dropped my phone and the screen shattered also leaving my screen unresponsive to the touch. I took a visit to T-mobile as usual in hopes of finding Jailene there. Jailene has always had exceptional service skills while working fast and efficiently. I was out of t mobile with my upgraded iPhone 13 and some accessories within the hour. Hands down always the best place to come and if you’re looking for someone to guide you in your cell phone services- ask Jailene.,2
"Jenny ID 055272 is the type of customer service I'm use to from tmobile.  She didn't haggle me or act as if it was a chore to assist a loyal long term faithful customer.  She explained things very clearly and made sure I wasn't ever inconvenienced. She allowed me to explain uninterrupted and also apologized for experiences with tmobile that had nothing to do with the care she was providing me. If every customer care representative was like her, T-mobile would be the only carrier needed in America. Please reward her with responsibility of management because she is ready to not only be the example but to set the example for others to follow. Promote now!",2
I had the best help from a representative named Nate is a representative named Nathan.. He helped me and his personality was so wonderful I wanted to leave a review he was very bubbly outgoing and very patient you have one wonderful asset on your team on your team T-Mobile. If I could call every time and have a bubbly personality like this I would never have a problem calling he took care of all my needs and was so friendly to go extra on helping me with my new device information he deserves a raise,2
I called tmobile today to repair a phone I bought from Bestbuy. I spoke with a Rep named Leslie today 1/23/22. She was very helpful & courteous she even stayed on the phone while I spoke to a repair technician . She went above & beyond to make sure that I was going to get a repair ticket before exiting off of the call. I'm very grateful for her superb customer service (some might say it's her job)because I know she didn't have to do it! Thank you Leslie & to all the Leslie's that really love assisting customers & resolving issues!,2
"At The Falls mall T-Mobil store Miami,FloridaAgent Estrella Conminas spent 1 hour on the phone with billing department helping me on a issue that was going on for a month. She had the professionalism, courtesy, knowledge and customer service attitude and took care the problem from roots. She was actually loosing money with me because at the end found out she works on commission only and lost other clients coming to purchace. She is the best of the best. would make a great manager + higher. Thank you T-MobilEstevez",2
"I had a good experience at Surfside T-Mobil branch today. Dominicea was so kind as I enter the store and Mykel was very helpful taking the time to respond my questions. Thank you for the courtesy to both of you. Keep up the kindness, good manners and work ethics.",2
"Hubs & I have been with T-Mobile for about 17-18years now. Our son has joined us on our phone plan & we now have the internet in our home provided by T-Mobile. We’ve had our battles in the past but I really cannot complain about their services. I had received a few emails from them this past couple weeks, asking to take a short survey & get a gift. I thought it was total bologna but did it anyway. Less than 2 weeks later, there was the prize that I had chosen in my mailbox!!!! Thank you T-Mobile!!! You are appreciated.",2
"On 5/25 I visited store at Eastgate Mall, Cin., Oh. Joe Alvarado and John Lombert assisted in changing phones for me for over 2 hrs. They were pleasant and very helpful.  I will always be a T Mobile customer!",2
Biggest frauds on the face of the planet!! Charging my mom for someone else’s account!! She’s almost 80!! What a scam and you don’t answer your phone. Cowards!! You know you’re crooks! Your service is crap!! You suck at customer service. Go Away!! You Suck!!,2
"Customer service over the phone 611, with T-Mobile, and  “Megan”, including the technical support, has gone above and beyond to do their job.They are very…. kind people who want to help in any capacity they know how.It’s greatly appreciated.And sadly they do not follow up with a survey. The time I want to report how impressed I am with the service I was given.So here I find myself searching for any kind of way to let others know my gratitude I feel tonight. Not often do I feel overwhelmed like this from the sincerity of another.Thank You T-Mobil for employee these wonderful people. I hope you take great care of them!!",2
On 11/20/21 I visited the T Mobile store number 6853 and received excellent customer service from Sales Rep # ****041. This representative was very professional and very friendly. Kudos to T Mobile for hiring such a high quality representative.,2
"I see a lot of negative reviews for T-Mobile but my personal experience has been wonderful. I just ordered a iPhone 13 Pro Max & the customer service was amazing!! A wonderful gentleman named Aziz is a saint!! I pick up my phone this week & he has offered to help me set it up, transfer data from my old phone, & help me add a new line for my Daughter. As an additional  bonus he has agreed to help me apply the screen protector (I have trouble getting it on right). If that isn’t outstanding customer service then I don’t know what is. I can’t speak for other stores BUT our T-Mobile goes above & beyond!! Thank you Aziz!!!  Love these guys!!",2
"T Mobile has been nothing but great...ok several areas up 75N towards Lee that's sketchy but that's it. Good customer service and can't beat the plans...a lot of entitled complaining here on this page...wah, wah, wah...",2
Tmobile has excellent service but they probably seem bad to all of you guys because they are probably vaccinated. Don’t get the vaccinated guys. Or you guys are probably vaccinated and have gone absolutely bonkers/silly.,2
"For me, customer service is everything. Most of the goods and services we use ate commodity, and work and even cost pretty much the same. So the real mark of qualities in a company is how they deal with issues as they arise. All things being equal, I haven’t really experienced customer service as responsive as T-Mobile’s. That doesn’t mean I always get what I want, but at least I know that someone with authority to do things has heard me.We have been customers for over nine years, and use them for both business and personal communications. There might be other companies or slightly better in some areas, but the combination of service and customer service means that I am happy",2
T-Mobile is fantastic! Thanks for saving me $150 monthly by taking me away from both Verizon and Hargray! Very happy with customer service as well. All the way around they are the better choice!,2
Crystie she was a good person to help me out with my bill I love her for what she did for my family  thank you god bless her and her family and her co workers family to t mobile the best phone company,2
"I love Mae and Cale.  They run the store and all is good.  I found it odd that two managers walked around the store looking at items and signs when the entire store was packed.  They had three people working and they were slammed with a LONG line.  I mean could they not jumped in an helped? Kim and the other male manager were more concerned about a sales rep drink being the counter and a crease in a sign.  I was rather taken back by the way Kim spoke to her employees.  She told me that she was the manager and I thought to myself I wouldn't want to work with or for you.  I mean who redirects an employee with an entire store of customers.  Again, love the customer service reps that work at this store.    They are kind and so helpful even though they have limited help.  And take unthoughtfulness from a manager.",2
"I would like a commend Matt C.  He was very helpful and cool.  One of the nicest people I’ve met at a phone store, this guy needs a promotion.Store 2SJO 1391 34th st N st Pete FL",2
Lamar was so PATIENT WONDERFUL AND SOME OF THIS BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FIXED ALL MY PROBLEMS HE IS BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT SO VERY POLITE HALES CORNERS WISC,2
"I don't understand when I saw a 2 rating.  My experience with T-Mobile in Pace, FL was outstanding!  First time to get internet.  Was paying $80 to AT&T and now I pay $50.  The person who help me at that time explained everything.  When I got home, I didn't understand something and I called and the problem was solved.  Was paying Straightalk  $90 and I am still paying $90....BUT...so many more bennies,  I now get Netflix monthly for always, Paramount free for a year and Apple for a year.  Might  only be for a year but I will still be saving $16 on Netflix alone a monthly after that.  My rep was Taylor.  Talk about patience,  She took care of everything from setting up my phone, to setting up a new phone for my husband. Now anyone who has changed carriers knows the time and frustration of doing it.  She took care of all of it and I wish I could contactT-Mobile to leave a review there.  She is an outstanding rep for T-Mobile.  That stores environment is relaxful, friendly and everybody seems so patient.  I give Taylor a 2 thumbs up for a job well done,",2
Dylan who is a phone tech for T-Mobile was very helpful.You guys have a great employee and he had honestly deserves a raise and to be promoted.,2
"I had an outstanding customer experience at the T-Mobile Store, 4225 Ramsey Street, Fayetteville, North Carolina! The Representative, Isaac, went ""above and beyond"" helping me get my new iPhone 13 Pro Max activated! I had problems getting the SIM card out of my old phone (iPhone 6S), and he literally provided me with the utmost professionalism, compassion and expertise! It took almost an hour to transfer my information to my new phone. He was not only patient through that process - but he went ABOVE and BEYOND by installing my new phone in the protective case and putting on the protective shield for me; both items I brought with me to the store, but had planned to do myself! I also watched Isaac treat other customers that entered into the store with that same level of warmth and professionalism! Thank you Isaac - and thank you T-Mobile!",2
I've had T-Mobile for over a year I've never had a service any better in my life just to let y'all know so many other providers are not,2
The customer service at Orland Park store 15615 Lagrange Rd was 10 stars. The best I’ve experienced.Thank youThank you Thank you,2
"I learned the hard way it's not always the provider that's the problem for slower data, etc. Sometimes it's the VPN.",2
"TMobile home internet is great, however signed up on 12/25/2021, received two units on 12/28/21. Tried for over a month to get a hold of someone on the phone to correct the issue of two units only to find out we had to drive an hour to the tmobile store. Customer service in the Elizabeth City NC store(Tanglewood Dr) was excellent. Representative Nik got us a new pin# for the unit we have hooked up and cancelled the account on the second one. We were to receive a return label  by email. That did not happen. Called customer service and they said sorry we can't help you. That account has been cancelled. Called Nik at the store we had previously visited, told him what was going on. He said let me call you back. Within 15 minutes, Nik called me back and told me to check my email. Sure enough, there was the label. Nik gave us the best customer service that I have had with a company in a very long time. The 5 star rating is for the service provided by Nik at the store.",2
Justice  (842) from Pottsville store was wonderful.... Justice explain everything and  perfect gentlemenThank you,2
"Been with T-Mobile for 16 years; thank you Shay for your customer service today, you're one of the reasons we haven't needed to explore other options.I should mention the online chat feature for customer service is not helpful. That's okay I just call in and someone's always available to help (Except at night).",2
James at the Aliquippa store is a Duuuude,2
"Supervisor, Nakiya Robinson did a great job today!  The professional and diligent attention given to each customer is remarkable!I bought the wrong phone in hopes she would get it working.  She worked on it for FOUR HOURS! Her patience is to be commended.  Gotta love a dedicated employee!  I will return with the correct phone next time and look forward to having her assist me again.",2
The best telecommunication company in the US!,2
"Is it the best internet...NoIs it the fastest....NoBut I find it to be very reliable and fast enough for my needs.It's reasonably priced, has no data caps and you don't need a land line to get it. Which in an area prone to bad storms and downed lines is important.I'm also able to stream multiple televisions with no problems so I've been able to cut the cable and halve my internet and television bills. (I now use youtube tv instead of comcast)When I've had to call customer service, they've always been very helpful and diligent in solving any problems I have had. They've also been very open and admitted if the problem was on their side and not tried to blame me like some internet companies I know.So overall I give them 5 stars. They're just starting out as a home internet provider and I think they're doing a great job. Like anyone just starting out, they're not perfect. They are, however, determined to give you the best internet possible.",2
I am a small business owner in town and I go to the local Oxnard T-Mobile at the Esplanade center. I absolutely love the staff they are so enormously helpful and honest which is hard to come by these days. The manager Jesus always treats us like we’re family and when we walk in the door they say our name and they all really seem like they want to do their utmost to make you happy that seems to be the very most important thing which I appreciate a lot because I’m always really happy especially when I walk out of there with a new thing. I’ve been going to Sprint for years and I’m excited to see all the T-Mobile has to offer us  as we transition from sprint to T-Mobile. I remember the days that when I was at my office I couldn’t except square payments because I had no Internet and now I do even though I don’t pay extra it’s on my phone and I like that. I really like the service and customer service when I call is also exemplary  and I appreciate that. I just came on here to just praise the Oxnard team mobile with manager Jesus . It’s awesome To go to a contemporary store and feel the hometown feeling by way of customer service. Thank you so much from Patti,2
"I must say that having Sprint acquired by T-Mobile has certainly made it difficult to get my phone serviced.  But, today, in Idaho Falls was an exception.  I was trying to send T-mobile my phone to get the screen repaired and the loaner phone that they sent to me just would not work despite spending two hours on the phone with their service people.  So, they directed me to a sprint/tmobile outlet in Idaho Falls in a shopping mall where I was lucky to encounter Emett. Emett used to be in the military until his eardrums were destroyed and he was returned to civilian life. Emett pointed out that T-mobile does not engage in repairs at their stores as Sprint did (bad change I must say), but he would do everything he could to try to get my loaner phone working.  And so as he ran between me and other customers he ultimately fixed my phone!  He was great and I'm sure would have been a Sprint superstar- too bad Sprint is disappearing.  But Emett did for me what Sprint would have done and I am so grateful!",2
"Went to the T Mobil Store at 10670 Culebra Road and W Loop 1604 in San Antonio and worked with Rachelle to correct the Billing on our cell phone service.  Rachelle listened to what had happened took our contract and went in the back office.  When she return we had good news.  The bill got straightened out to our satisfaction.  Rachelle is the Assistant Store Manager.  She knows how to treat people and knows what customer satisfaction means.  We are seniors ages 76 and 77 and so often are not treated with the Respect and Dignity that Rachelle showed to us.  In addition Rachelle reset our cloud names that were misspelled and downloaded the yahoo mail app so we could access mail on our cell phone.  Rachelle is a Breath of Fresh air, she is one of a kind and a Excellent T Mobil Employee.  She deserves a merit increase and if I had a business I would hire Rachelle in a blink of an eye, which my friends is faster than a New York Minute.  Thank you Rachelle for your Kindness and Patience with us to get our billing issue resolved.",2
"Yesterday, October 27th 2021, I went to T-Mobile on Hull Street store number 637D, and to my surprise I was helped by a young lady by the name of ABENI PAGE. She went above and beyond to help me with a situation pertaining to my phone. I have been to several other locations of T-Mobile in the Hampton roads area. All of the representatives were unable to help me with my situation. Ms. ABIEN PAGE, without hesitation knew exactly what she was doing! She was knowledgeable and very helpful and able to multitask as well not to ignore any other customers in the store. ABENI PAGE, is deserving of a pay increase. She is an essential employee of T-Mobile and should be recognized. She restored my faith in T-Mobile. Perhaps she can offer something more to T-Mobile, if every representative was trained to obtain her qualities, there would be no negative posts about T-Mobile. I was so impressed with this young lady that I'm not stopping here! I will take time to personally contact Isaiah Johnson so he is well aware of a fabulous employee that's representing T-Mobile! Thank you ABENI PAGE for your time, for your assistance and restoring faith in my choosing T-Mobile and leaving Verizon.",2
"I contacted TMobile on several occasions to request they mail bills to my Mom for her cell phone account without any success. They could not explain why they stopped mailing bills to her because she NEVER requested paperless statements!!!!! I was given the run around so many times I made decision to switch her cell phone to my cell phone carrier.  The worse customer no service I ever experienced!!!!I physically went to a T-Mobile store and spoke to the most awesome, professional customer service rep named Yvette (Brass Mill Mall-Waterbury, Ct.) She listened to my story and immediately took action to assist me.  Yvette went above and beyond the call of duty.  She was able to honor my request to have bills mailed to my Mom after spending several minutes on the phone with her fellow TMobile colleague and advising him how important it was to service and satisfy the customer. I'm so happy she was able to resolve this situation and illustrate the true meaning of a customer advocate.  Her patience and determination to make every effort to assist me was truly awesome. Yvette 's superb skills and efforts to resolve this very simple request are the only reason I decided not to switch to another carrier.   Thank you Yvette!!!!!!",2
"I recently became a t mobile customer.  I made the decision to switch from Verizon because of the great offer they gave me.  As the months went buy  I asked about the $200 that was suppose to be credited to my account.  So they told me that they divide it up and credit my account on a monthly basis, and it takes a month or so to hit my account. So I finally realized that something wasn’t right.  Instead of getting the $200 I was promised I only got $100.  Apparently what happened, I was given the wrong amount by someone who no longer works there.   I was disappointed but Emanuel was awesome.  He took to the phone to call customers service to get things straightened out.  It took 30 minutes or so.  The first time calling didn’t get anywhere but he was determined to fix my situation. Called back and asked for a supervisor and finally got through.  He explained the situation again. This time they finally worked with him and was able to get my a credit for the difference. I was very appreciative and he wasn’t about to give up.   I am an Assistant Operations Manager for Rite Aid. I know what great service is.    This young man has great customer service skills. If you are looking to switch or get a new service he is up on the deals and is willing to go above and beyond.  Go see Emanuel at T Mobile in the Loop in Methuen   You won’t be disappointed.",2
Gerardo is the best sale associate super funny sweet kind and helpful highly recommend him,2
I've been with T-Mobile for over a year very reliable I love their company,2
Very professional and competent service. Store is wll organized and managed.,2
I want to thank to Felix for the excellent customer service,2
Nothing to complain. Tmobile is the best ever!,2
"I needed a case and new glass protector on my phone.  I dread this kind of errand.  My past experience with another company, was aggravating because of the attitude and lack of help. Today I went to the T-Mobile on Main St. in North Tewksbury and had an entirely different experience.  Armando was GREAT!  I left there very happy.  Next time I will not dread the errand at all.  Thank you Armando!",2
"Having trouble with reception on my A32.  I went into a T Mobile store, and a young man named Eli helped me.  As soon as I walked into the store, Eli acknowledged me, and said he would be with me in a moment (normally, I am ignored).  Eli was very kind and helpful to me, and the next customers who came in after me, giving them information quickly to help.T Mobile is lucky to have someone like Eli on their team.",2
"Honestly, I am really surprised at the low scores of these consumers, because I cannot say enough about how well T-Mobile has really take care of me, specifically Phil ID#2196859.  In fact this man single handedly, made me have a complete different view of cellphone providers, that I have personally encountered in my 42 years. Most companies, are out to dupe their customers into hidden fees, excessive charges that were not there during sign up and once the get you in, you are trapped in the endless cycle of more and more fees and customer service calls. Well, this employee, Phil ID#2196859, single handedly change the game of cellphone customer service providers.I am a semi new customer, for me it is because I usually pick a company, and stick with them, as long as they are treating me like a valuable piece to a successful business.  This is any business, multi billion dollar business, to the local mom and pop business that has been open since the beginning of time. Customer service is the road for businesses to connect with their customers, customer service should be looked at as a reflection of how a businesses history is with their customers, but I want to say, that sometimes that reflection is fabricated.I had had issues with my phone, it's a new phone and I have already had to replace it three times, it's not a top tier cellphone but I don't mind all that, bells and whistles are not my thing. Function and Accessibility is all I care about. But I need my cellphone to work, I use my phone for work and this phone I got at sign up, crashes every two seconds, so my original complaint was only directed to the phone not my service. I actually had a semi hard time trying to trade my original phone back or have it replaced even though I had that specific phone for two days literally and not exactly two, it was more like 36 hours. But I requested to speak to a supervisor and she apologized for the inconvenience of the previous specialist behavior that his behavior was not what T-Mobile stands for.  She was very kind, and seemed to have fix everything, I had a new phone arriving, with a return label for the the broken one.I got my new bill, and not only was the charges that has previously been credited was back. She had not done what she had said she would do.  But I am a very fair person, I wasn't angry at all. I didn't know what had happened, it could have very well be within the system but it was my bottom line. My decision to call T-Mobile was ultimately to part ways or at least find out what I need to do to close my account, even if there was a charge.  But T-Mobile must have felt my vibe coming through the phone and sent in the he bug guns, because this is where Phil stepped in.I wanna also say, I am writing this review, on my experience with them, because of this particular person. Everything that is stated here is 100% truth, I find it unethical to write reviews that are fabricated for an incentive for that person or company. And I kind of feel like the sheer amount of bad reviews isn't and shouldn't reflect your decisions about T-Mobile, they make it extremely easy, and they also give some bad credit a chance without exuberant price fluctuations. T-Mobile in my opinion is highly underrated and I also believe majority of these reviews are baseless and not accurate.When I got Phil on the line it truly was a huge blessing for me and my family. As I have been dealing with these cellphones for a couple months and to be honest I don't have the energy.  My husband is in ICU and my brother just passed from Covid. And I don't think that I would be a customer if it weren't for Phil.  He was genuinely a very kind person, he should amazing customer service skills, had a clear understanding of his job, and executed a job with such professionalism, and care that I felt so grateful that I came directly here to make sure he gets recognized and If I could speak to his supervisor, I would say.. if you had about 3000 Phil's, within this company they would have five stars everywhere, the supervisor that did not do what she she promised, was no where near a professional as he was. And I honestly from the bottom of my heart, and a lifetime customer because of Phil. I cannot stress enough, him being a kind person was so important in this situation. nd he did just that and I can't tell you enough how he made my day turn completely around, I am truly grateful to this gentleman and if you are reading this Phil, thank you again!",2
Couldn't be more pleased with the sales representatives.  Both Henley & Ruth couldn't have done more as they both were well informed; giving us the information we needed & answering our questions. Thanks to both!!!,2
"I have to make a review about this T-Mobile company.  If I only knew about how excellent their customer service are, I would have switched to them a long time ago.  I only been with this company this year and so far, they have given me a lot of wonderful perks considering I only a prepaid customer.  I wish I can remember all of the customer service staff I have spoken to re: my account, the latest one was Jorge (1878975), he was so helpful to me.  He was very patient and took care of my concerns re: travel abroad and connections.  What a wonderful customer service staff.  I am giving him 5 stars for taking care of me and my t-mobile needs.  You guys deserve recognition for your excellent service.",2
"Absolutely splendid people at TMobile on Erie Blvd in Syracuse, NY. Stephanie transformed my service package, cutting my bill in half. Set us up with new iPhones, all at reduced $$$. Great positive people who know their stuff.",2
"I visited the Foxchase store in Alexandria and ALL of the people that I worked with were professional, customer based, and extremely helpful.  I upgraded 2 Iphones because of the staff.Fantastic job Jr, Maria and John.  Thank you.",2
"I had a fantastic experience with an associate in Columbus Ohio at the T-mobile store on Sawmill. The one around the cornee from Trader Joe's. I was having issues with my phone and they were out of a cord. So I went to the other one down the street. There they checked my cord and told me it might be a phone issue and that I would need to forfeit my phone and they would send it in to check something and that would cost me money and time. Something told me to go back to the other t-mobile and get a second opinion. When I did the associate Crystal told me my phone was still under warranty and so I could get a new phone for $5.00. The phone only took 3 days to come in. And when I went back to pick it up she helped me port everything over. Even figured out how to get it to save my dreams which I recorded on the recorder. She was excellent, so helpful, and had all the answers. Plus she was a delight to work with. My new phone is working beautifully now. Thanks for the incredible service!",2

"We went to the TMobile in Centerra, Store 228 and spoke to Alex.  We weren't sure if we wanted to purchase a new phone because one of ours was always in need of repair.  He showed us every option from trading in to buying a new one, to adding a line.  He was so patient, respectful and professional.  We have to let T-Mobile know that Alex should be commended.  We did buy a new phone and he did explain everything to us.  We have been with T-Mobile for 24 years from when it was Voicestream.  Thank you Alex",2
Getting new service was so non hassle. So much that I ordered a phone for my daughter and then after receiving hers I ordered myself one. I was a Sprint customer for 10+ years and it was overall good service. I appreciate a company that appreciates my business like what I’ve seen so far with with you.,2
"I want to give accolades to 3 people at the Ames store ABSN store #402.573.5678 in Omaha, NE. Amir, Taleigha & Robin did so much to resolve my issues. This was my 2nd time in the store for this issue. Amir was helping me and through no fault of his own, I was overwhelmed with the whole process of trying to get a new phone. WiFi was terribly slow so he couldn't access my account. My phone was too old for a TMobile sim card. A new phone would cause problems for the other two people on the account. It just wasn't good so, I left. Today was stellar! Amir remembered me so I didn't have repeat my issue. WiFi was working so he quickly found my account & introduced the phone I was eligible for. He and Taleigha and Robin worked together to quickly get my new phone working. I am a senior citizen & they took the time explain things to me. They didn't make me feel stupid. They even brought me a chair to sit in while things were getting done. I expressed that with the new phone, I might be able to hear my phone music through my car. They offered to set it up. They'd already done enough so I talked them out of it. I walked out of the store floating on cloud nine. Thanks to these 3 people.",2
"I am new to T-mobile.  I am coming from verizon, the most awful copany in cell service I have ever dealt with.  I called them and could not get a person.  They force the chat option where robots answer questions and if you can get a human, they spew the same garbage.  I paid $70 and stayed one month.  I called T-mobile, got a person right away. Normal for new service.  I had to call customer service through 611 and got a person pretty quickly.  The first gal did not get my issue taken care of but since I found 2 more things I needed help with, I got someone who went beyound and called verizon to get my account number to port my number properly.  The call hung up immediately when the port was successful.  Took a little time but I got it done.  In fact, just a second ago I got a call verifying everything I needed taken care was taken care of.  Number  ported, got my netflix, and hotspot now works.  I got a hold of a person.  Verizon no longer answers their phones at the stores.  This even says so on thier answering machine on all 3 stores in Lincoln NE.  I went in and was told to open in a browser and figure it out.  I walked out.  Very disappointing experience.  I spent hours trying to sinc the ap and the phone and while their end said it was successful, I could not log in no matter how many magic numbers they sent me.  Nothing worked.  The phone will NOT work without the ap.  I had to enter in all information 17 times the first time and it kept erasing everything and putting me back to the beginning.  I only did it 6 times the second before I called T-mobile.  The ap is optional with T-mobile.  Maybe it is not all that good or maybe it is.  Either way I can chat from my laptop if I have the time or I can dial 611 and spend a couple minutes getting around their answering system to see if it is a quick fix or your issue is on their phone menu. The first rep tried and was really nice. She might be new.  The second rep spoke better English and that helps because I am hard of hearing.  The 3rd rep was in chat and she helped me with the rest of set up.  Then she called back to make sure I got everything I needed for my new service.  So far so good.  I rarely call a cell phone carrier so I hope to have many years of good service.  Way better than verizon in customer service.  I can't tell you anything about cell service because I was not able to use any other service other than call or text and a lot of the time they wanted me to connect to the internet and data did not work.  Very happy right now.",2

"As loyal Sprint customers for 20+ years (we switched once and hated it, so back to Sprint we went) we were saddened by the merger announcement. My  husband's phone died recently and we went to get a new on at T-mobile, our very first experience with them.  It didn't start out great, but between multiple staff members and Chris & Vikas over in the customer support phone center were a true pleasure to deal with.  We spent 6 hours in the T-mobile store and didn't even walk out with a working phone and we're still happy with the outcome and will be back tomorrow to get a new phone. We appreciate all the help and assistance in getting my husband back up on the grid.",2

"Well, I am coming to SHINE some SUNLIGHT about my T-Mobile!  I’ve had an OVERALL GREAT experience with T-MOBILE. Like with ANY company, they have their kinks to work out, but MY experience has been, pretty much, GREAT. Let me start by saying I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the CHAT customer service versus calling in. The CHAT customer service is 100% satisfactory with me! They haven’t missed a beat(5-0) with whatever I need! Granted my issues aren’t MAJOR, but they are friendly, fast, professional, and willing to go the extra mile without being promoted. My daughter has Verizon wireless and my service picks up where hers doesn’t and vice versa(at times). I enjoy my T-Mobile.",2

He was very patient and made sure I could reach all my sites before I walked out the door.  Thank you Devin.

You deserve a raise. 😊😎you are a rock star!",2

"I want to leave a review so other people can see it. While the representative in the actual store failed me, the representatives in the call center in Tampa have gone above and beyond to help me. At one point I even had to speak to a supervisor, and he was able to fix the situation fairly quickly.I see a lot of negative feedback on this page, and I want others to know that if they are able to fix a situation that they absolutely do.A few weeks ago we took advantage of a promotion on the Galaxy S21 plus phones. They were buy one get one! The lady at the store told us that we could save money by switching are phone plans, and just getting a hotspot for the house... letting me lose a wonderful plan I was grandfathered into. The plan I was originally on is unlimited hotspot through my phone for $25 a month. Instead I was  talked into paying $55 for a hundred gigs a month... yeah that was not fair. Our bill ended up being well over what our original bill was, even before paying on the new device.The representative I spoke to on the phone did the best they could to fix what they could. However I still managed to have to talk to her supervisor, so that he could switch his back to our original plans.Flash Forward to today, I got my new bill update... $150 more than what my original bill is usually. So of course I was angry. I knew I would be paying more since I was paying on a device, and the fact that we have protection plans in place on both of our phones. But $150 was not the right amount...So again I called back, I wanted to speak to the supervisor I talk to you before just because he was familiar with my information prior. He was on another call at the time, so the representative I spoke to spoke it over with his supervisor, and was able to come up with a solution. He solved the problem and Save the Day!My situation was very confusing, it was even confusing for me to have to explain to them. But each representative and supervisor understood and fixed the issue.As I said, the girl inside of the store was terrible. She lied to us up front and cause a whole lot of issues... but thank God for those supervisors at the call center.",2

We recently bought 2 I Phones from the store at Dr. Phillips . Store #54GE I believe. We were taken care of by Irvin. He was just fabulous. He took care of us and made sure we our transition from AT&T went smoothly.  We love our new I Phones and Irvin made sure we knew we could ask any Questions we might have!,2
"Just want to sincerely express appreciation for representative Leslie (9948600) at Clive IA location. She was so incredibly kind,thorough and patient with a ""nontechie"" customer like me. She made me feel my phone switchover and setup was her priority. What a sweetheart!",2
"After installing a new T-Mobile SIM card in my Sprint phone, I had extremely poor service in one particular very rural area near McHenry, Maryland. After spending at least one hour on-line chatting via WiFi with a Sprint representative in an attempt to improve my service, I lost all service for several days. Then, while traveling for a funeral, I took my phone to a T-Mobile store in Windsor, CT, where the store manager, Abigail Surrell, restored my service in about 10 minutes. Now it's better than every. Thank you Abigail. Of course, I have no praise for the original on-line chat representative from Sprint!",2
T-Mobile on Howard Road is fantastic manager and Associates are wonderful they are a great help their patients they take time with you to understand if you're buying a new phone they're awesome definitely recommend to purchase phones from T-Mobile on Howard Road in Rochester New York,2
"I needed faster speed for my 5G phone.  I know performance is a matter of device/technology/coverage near my areaI had tried AT&T prepaid, Cricket, Visible, all on the largest/fastest/mostest-whatever unlimited service...My service speed and quality deteriorated with each in the order mentioned above!I decided to try T-Mobile prepaid...  On the speed, they delivered!  A sweet 200 Mbps in my area!Within the same week, I went back to my local T-Mobile store to switch from prepaid to postpaid, so I can explore and benefit from some of the additional perks on postpaid.  I activated 3 lines on postpaid Magenta Max.On the cost includes all fees and taxes, they delivered!On the speed on postpaid, they delivered!On the perks with the Tuesdays app...  I'm still waiting to find something that appeals me enough to go get it, but this is far from a dealbreaker!On the additional add-ons (included in Magenta Max), they delivered!  The SCAM Shield works good.  The DIGITIS app works good and with that, an additional phone number provided to preserve additional confidentiality when dialing out.  All that included in my Magenta Max monthly plan, in addition to unlimited text, talk and data!  On all this, they delivered!On service, over the phone, I wish I had written down the name of the person I spoke with to provide specific kudos to that person!  First, yes, service is over the phone, not self-service via a web page, you actually speak with a human!  She handled my questions and responded with clear information that was all accurate.  She ended the call by saying she was going on vacation but she would contact me once she had returned...  Me, based on all my previous customer service experience, I had forgot about this, assuming I would never get a call back...  But guess what?  Exactly on the day she had said to be back, the phone rings and there she was, following-up on my request!  I had a remaining question and she committed to address it herself directly, so I don't have to go through repeating my story again, and that she would call me back in about 3 days on this!  On customer service, not only they delivered but exceeded my expectations!From my local T-Mobile, I also received the same experience, very courteous, speedy and clear explanations.  On the locally provided service, T-Mobile delivered as well!I do not receive compensation for my review and I am not affiliated with T-Mobile in any ways.  I am just a happy customer!",2
"I have been there twice and it’s been great experience with this young guy very professional Rafael Tapia.I am really happy very helpful, best customer service.I will recommend my friends T-Mobile",2
"WOW...Courtney Silas who is the Store Manager and Glenn Ordway.Talk about unbelievable knowledge and service. I went to the Oakleaf store with a slew of questions because I am coming over from Sprint, and because of that I had a few hiccups due to the merger not at either Agents Fault.  But to no avail they jumped into action with a solution that works out for me in the end. I can't believe how informative and welcoming these 2 were and if you ever are in the area please be sure to ask for either one of them, they make you feel like Family which is important in this time and age. I am THRILLED to say I am a forever T-Mobile customer...  Thank You again Courtney and Glenn..Respectfully,Alyse V.",2
"We've been with T-Mobile for 8+ years now, by necessity, as they are the only ones who provide service at our location (despite the fact that we live in big city). Both T-Mobile's coverage and customer service continue to vastly improve. It used to be somewhat frustrating, but their customer service is much faster and more helpful than it used to be. My billing issues were resolved by phone within 20 minutes (including time to connect to a rep), kindly and to our satisfaction. Their rollout of 5G is improving our coverage. We have gone from begrudging customers to happy customers, and will continue with them even if other carriers fix their coverage. Another perk is a new store close to our house with by great service & short waits.",2
"Just stopped by TMobile (Glastonbury, CT) on my way home to replace my headphones. I was helped by two young ladies were super friendly, patient, and made sure I had what I needed before leaving the store. They definitely went above and beyond!",2
Obi at T-mobile in Citrus Park is awesome! He was knowledgeable and kind.  I have been a T-mobile customer for years and I will not consider any other carrier because of employees like Obi!,2
"The T-Mobile in Marlow Heights is awesome! I just want to say thank you to Kennedy, Diamond, Kristin for all of their help and understanding! Kennedy welcomed us as soon as we came in the door. Everyone was friendly and professional. Hands down the best service we’ve ever received! We will spread the word to others and we will for sure be back!",2

"I had an excellent experience with an employee named Dawn Zeman at the Oconomowoc Store.  She was very patient and helpful, aiding me through a situation where other employees weren't helpful, and didn't want to help me out.",2
Anthony from Shakopee MN was awesome and resolved all questions/concerns!,2
I got a question. Is it an invasion of privacy. Is it proper protocol? when you go into T-Mobile(or now sprint also) they ask you for your driver's license and you comply. They  take a picture of you and your driver's license. Sometimes your driver's license is all. That bothers me.,2
Edit☆ updated from 2 stars to 5ok so they called me back I'm so glad- a supervisor reviewed one of my bad surveys and reviewed my case. She called this morning / apologized and took care of my issue with no problem- this is the TMobile I've known for years.. so grateful!!1st/ initial review-I'm being generous I've been with tmobile for 14 yrs - added family as well. Up until recently the customer service has been great now.. not at all. Instead of customer service being accountable for issues - the issues are passed on for others to handle [ and noone calls me back to update me] I was in customer  service for 20 yrs- never a good sign when customer service goes downhill/ every customer should matter..Got me rethinking my loyalty,2
"The service in T-Mobile Greenbelt  Maryland were superb. The 2 ladies were very helpful, quick and very thorough. Thanks.",2

"On April 3/4 I visited the T Mobile store at 14 mi rd and Schoenherr in Sterling Hgts, Mi to upgrade my phone.  I was waited on by Chris/Belle/Calvin all of whom I found to be very helpful and professional.",2
I came across these reviews and had to leave one for myself.  I've been a TMobile customer since 2013.  I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Customer service is the best I've ever delt with.  They know what they're talking about and have resolved the few minor issues that I've encountered over the past eight years.  My bills are always correct.  If I could rate them 100 stars I would,2
"I went through 3 days waiting to resolve the purchase of iPad 8 plus and a Samsung Tablet. After 7 years with T-Mobile this was my first difficult experience. With that being said I decided to call T-Mobile about this situation and the T-Mobile Professional, Exceptional,Patient, Alexus in Birmingham, was an absolute Gem in resolving a three day frustrating experience. I am a retired Accounting Manager from a multi franchise organization and Trust me when I tell you, T-Mobile, You have the Best of the Best in this young lady! She turned an absolute mess into a, “ I love T-Mobile moment! “ if I were not retired I’d be trying to steal Alexus from you as I know from experience how very difficult it is to find anyone with the ability to change a customers state of emotions from zero to 60 in just a few moments. It’s important to Employees to know the impact they’ve had in the company that keeps your customers coming back. It’s not the product it’s the Representatives that keep your customers with T-Mobile.Thank You Alexus!",2
"Store # 4FSQ 1255 S Broad St. Wallingford, Ct 06492...

"i just would like to thank Andres from2000 el Camino Real T-Mobile store for taking the time to help me and my family to chose the right plans and cell phones after having a horrible experience with AT&T cancelling all our lines and leaving us with out service. I really appreciate that Andres and he's team was there all the way till we got our service back .I personally give him and he's team 5 stars because of he's patience, very knowledgeable on helping me out on calling AT&T and finding out what really happen.

"In the world for cell phones; I first started out with a  Black berry. T-Mobile was my carrier. It froze and some how I went to get it looked at but the Sprint rep. came to me and I was dooped into that carrier. I always had a problem with billing. I then came back to T-mobile. I moved to a remote place and traveled often; I felt I had to change my carrier again so I went to Verizon. Customer service by phone was horrible; picking up a new phone at the Roxbury location was awful. Billing was atrocious. I had to abandon ship even though I still owed for the device.  I am now convinced that T-Mobile was always my home. I am back and never leaving again. The Mount Olive location is where I found my first love back. Everyone at this location has been helpful in me obtaining  my new phone. The manger CIHAN HAZER  truly came through. He continued to follow up with me to ensure all my questions and challenges were resolved. He has a great personality, Very knowledgeable as well as very professional.  I would recommend any one who is looking to switch from those other carriers to T-MOBILE. The Mount Olive Location is where it's at.",2
"I just have to say James B from the colorado call center is so nice!!!!! He helped me so much I was so irritated my phone calls kept dropping and texts not sending and he gave me advice he did so many amazing things for me like waive delivery fees, put credit into the account. He was so helpful and he really made me such a happy customer. I have to say this here he was the head senior technician at tmobile and he truly truly cares about the customers. I'm always nervous about who I'm going to get but I was so happy to talk to James B he was so friendly honestly and really made it his goal to do whatever he could to make me happy. He really made me feel comfortable and helped me as much as he could. Anyway, I hope other people get him or anyone else from Colorado call center and they will help you I promise!! Please also leave a review or ask to speak to their supervisor when you have a good experience with someone, we are so used to leaving bad reviews or giving supervisors bad feedback about the representatives, but if someone does a good job please let their supervisors know!",2
"Dylan Von Sloten is an outstanding T-mobile expert. I was impressed with his excellent customer service skills. He demonstrated the ability to carefully listen to my phone issues. He displayed effective people skills in meeting, addressing, and resolving my phone issues. He was pleasant, patient, and knowledgeable in implementing a new phone service for me. I see him as a Valuable T-Mobile employee. If I need to return to T-Mobile store, at 2100 S. E. 164th Ave. suite A106, I prefer to ask for Dylan to assist me.",2

"I had just transferred my cell phone to T-Mobile. But unfortunately the coverage was an adequate so I had to leave. I want to give a huge shout out to Autumn who resides in Colorado Springs. She worked tirelessly on my account getting everything as it should be. T-Mobile has one terrific customer service rep.Autumns skill set, follow-through, and pleasant attitude made me wish I could have stayed with T-Mobile.Please reward her for the wonderful work she does.Mary Ellen Martin",2
T-mobile is #1 in my book. Never had an issue with billing or phone service. They are better and less expensive than others. I have their Revvell phone and for $200 you can't beat it. I'm on my phone all day with calls and research and it keeps on going. .,2
"Wife needed a new phone .. went to store 1001 on 3551 parkway village ct. winston salem, nc. Store mgr. Johnathon was one of the best customer service person. He asked what my wife ( Cathy ) needed and then proceeded to show her several options. He could have up sold her to a more expensive phone but advised her she didn't need to. Also got a great deal ( trade in ). He even called us after the sale to see if everything was good. T mobile has never disappointed us in over 18 years and employees like Johnathon will keep us coming back . Thank You !!!",2
"Well, let's start with, my daughter and I walked in the T-Mobile store with frowns and feeling a bit confused. Leaving Metro Pcs after  25 years wasn't  going to be easy. Being very loyal customers we were very nervous. I must say meeting with Madison Piper Mobile Expert, we soon walked out of store 7842 in Clearwater all smiles. Madison Piper was just very kind and smooth on explaining all information to us. My daughter knows more about these new phones but was confused. I being a senior know nothing about new phones, plans ect felt worried about my choice to switch from Metro Pcs. Let me tell you Miss Madison went over and above what we both expected. In no time we felt relaxed and excited about our purchases and choice. She help me with apps. She showed me how to maintain my phone so I drain less power ect. Madison Piper was awesome. My rating of her and her service was a 10 across all boards, she knows and did her job well. Thank T-Mobile and again, we look forward to a long relationship. Thanks Madison  Piper my daughter and I give you a  ( 10 ) we are Extremely satisfied!",2

I am a new t-mobile user.  I visited a store in Renoldsburg Oh to ask for help with my Google assistant.  Unfortunately when they replaced my sim card they deleted photos and contacts from my phone.  Devastating. Couldn't get anything back.I went to the Pataskala store and was helped to at least get my apps in the right places and helped me secure backup so this shouldn't happen again. So thankful for Grant and his caring attitude.   I have worked retail and I know how valuable a good employee can be.  He went above and beyond to help me.  Kudos to Grant.,2
"My new Samsung phone crashed after 5 months. Costco wouldn't take it back because it was past their 90 day policy on phones. T-Mobile support asked me to describe the problem, transferred me to Tech Support, who asked me to describe the problem and finished up by saying ""we'll send you a new phone."" That's pretty much the whole story, called on Friday, got the new phone on Monday.",2
"Michelle (T-Mobile, Market St., Flowood, MS), my sales rep/phone tech was extremely nice, first and foremost. Although I had to make a second visit because Tyler the first rep two days earlier was not knowledgeable enough to get my current phone data transferred to my new phone. I left the store without a working phone. For the next two days I tried transferring the data myself to no avail. Today, Michelle went through the exact steps needed to get my data transferred and took less than 15 minutes to complete the process.  My phone is working as it should; very well!!! I’m extremely satisfied with her (Michelle’s) customer service, knowledgeable disposition and kindness.  This’ll be my store wheb I need to return to T-Mobile fir anything cellular because of Michelle, (Flowood, Mississippi store on Market Street).",2

"I have been a customer of T- mobile for well over 18 years now. I Moved to Las Vegas from Seattle Washington. Since being here, I have gone to a couple of T- mobile stores in my area, and I must say that I was NOT pleased with the customer service at either location ! However, I did not give up on locating a T- mobile store, that I would be satisfied with. As time went by, I did find a T- mobile store, close to where I do some of my shopping. The moment that I walked in, I just knew, that I was in the PERFECT T- mobile store. I was Pleasantly surprised. I was Immediately greeted by a friendly staff members, The wait timewas very short. The sales associate was very helpful & knowledgeable. The associate Eddie, and store manager Shiloh, helped me with getting a new phone for my Grandson. They both went above and beyond. I thank them.

"I was so impressed with the T-Mobile on Lawrenceville-Suwanne Road, Suwanne, GA.  I am a 65 year old female with limited knowledge about technology.  I young man named Breenen was the customer service representative that waited on me.  He was very patient, informative, professional and had a wonderful demeanor about him.  I think he could see at some point I looked like a deer in headlights and still did not make me feel stupid.  Ha. He gave me a short tutorial before I left. The teaching time and porting of information and number over to the new phone did not take barely 30 minutes.  I had planned to spend a couple of hours. This young man is an asset to your company.",2

"After experiencing a problem with our Sprint phones, my husband & I decided it was time for new phones. We went to the T-Mobile store in Greece-Ridge Mall, store #350. We were greeted and waited on by Justin.  As we are senior citizens, the newer technologies can seem a little daunting.  Justin was the epitome of a excellent salesman, very patient and knowledgeable about our new phones. Even after we returned home and phoned him numerous times he never showed us anything but professionalism, if he was unable to take our call, he was very prompt in returning it.  This young man made a challenging purchase much easier.  We will encourage any of our friends wishing to upgrade their phone to go to T-Mobile and ask for Justin.  Eileen Klemz",2
Hello my name is Jackie Johnson. I've been a tmobile customer for years. I took my mom in 2 weeks ago for a problem with her phone. Tmobile at 1921-2 Gallatin Pike Madison TN.

"I must commend John Motley the T-Mobile Manager in Atlanta West End store.  I switched my business lines from Sprint to T-Mobile on 21Dec20 after being on the phone with customer service for 3 hours with no resolution.  Mr. Motley was very patient and took his time with me while servicing other customers in the store and on the phone.  He was also coaching two new trainees in the store at the same time. He exemplified exceptional professionalism throughout the 2 hours I was in the store.  He stayed on hold with customer service until he was able correctly switched my phone over to T-Mobile.I called Mr. Motley again on 28Dec20 because my second line was disconnecting the main line. He saved me from returning to the store and worked with customer service again for 2 hours to resolved the issue.  Mr. Motley needs to be compensated for adding value to the West End store.   Mr. Motley! Thank you, for your outstanding work ethics.  Landmark REIG",2
I don't know what these 1 start reviews are. It's either people not understanding what they are signing up for or fake reviews. I've never experienced better customer service. Yes the employees at the stores are ok but that's every service but the experts when you call are just amazing. White glove treatment.,2
4-year customer. Love the customer service and the prices.,2

I just got off the phone with an customer service agent named Diamond. She was such a doll!!! I really appreciate how nice people are and this is why I’ve had t-mobile for 13+ years!!! Thank you!!! I really hope you see this Diamond,2
I am a Sprint customer and have been since 2016. I recently sent my note 9 in to Asuncion to repair the screen. When I received the phone back they sent the wrong sim card back with my phone. Our local t-mobile store is closed for some odd reason so we traveled 40 miles to get my phone fixed. At first they were not sure but they put all their time and effort into restoring my service! Thank you Quad and Salvador! I appreciate you making something better in my day! Thank goodness 🙏,2
"I give t-mobile 5 stars because through this whole thing,  they have been the most understanding and compassionate business I've encountered!! Without a doubt you can truly see they really care genuinely about their  customers. My bill is high because I've been out of employment a few months but they have stood by my side. As long as I call and keep them informed they are willing to help do whatever they can to keep you running! And now I found a new job,  my bills will be paid up but if it wasn't  for them  helping me keep my phone on, I would of  never found it! T-mobile  your kindness and compassion during this pandemic  will NEVER EVER be forgotten!! Thank you!Angel",2

"I am in Fort Collins Colorado. I had a very bad experience with the shift from sprint to T-mobile. Literally have been in the store for hours, probably a total of 15-20 hours over the past couple months to get my small business account cleared up. Ali was the worker who helped me through it and did an excellent job! Some of the best and most diligent customer service I have had. Sal is the manager there and seemed to be helpful as well. My experience with T-mobile has been a difficult one, and if it wasn't for the customer service at the Fort Collins store I would have taken my business account elsewhere. So kudos to Ali for helping us through this",2
"I have been a T-Mobile customer for about fifteen years. I purchased a new phone five days ago and got EXCELLENT service from Joseph and Belle expert reps. I received my phone the next day with free shipping. Walked into T-Mobile at the wellington green mall (Florida) and ALEX went above and beyond to get my new phone working, downloading apps for me because my old phone crashed so I could not transfer my information to the new phone. TMOBILE is my carrier.",2
Great experience with the Patchogue store on Sunrise Highway. Wonderful people especially Vic. Honest talk no problems. Highly recommend.,2
"I had the greatest experience at T-mobike since I've been a customer. I visited the Winder,Ga store on May street. Your agent in this store Clara was the friendliest and most helpful person I've ever encountered. She took care of all my needs in an exceptional manner. She is super.",2
"I originally went to T-Mobile (Taylor,Tx) for information so I could compare companies. Scott, Joanna & Juan were AMAZING!! They were very knowledgeable,  understanding & helpful,  explaining everything & answering all my questions.  I gave them my budget and I walked out with 2 awesome phones, a perfect plan suited to fit my needs and I even got some little gifts for T-Mobile Tuesday. Thank you thank you thank you! I highly recommend T-Mobile !",2
"Left At&t two years ago because At&t was too expensive. I was paying $300 a month on a family plan with five phones. Moved to T-Mobile and my bill was $195 a month. I had 4 issues all solved by US support people. International roaming is great. I have used once a year sometimes more.  No charges at all since T-Mobiles explains what is free and what is charged..   We got to test T-Mobile before switching we knew where my parents live there is only one bar of signal but as to wifi calling it did not matter compared to we live we get nearly full signal.   T-Mobile was very helpful to my parents as to the low signal they sent out extender boxes once in stock free which fixed issue from zero or one bars of signal to 2-3 bars inside.   Once the towers for Sprint are switched to T-mobile my parents will have more signal as Sprint has a tower nearby with out the need for the extender signal boxes.Paying less, free global roaming, and US support no complaints.",2
I was having issues with my phone charging Reba helped me - hooked me up and got me back in the game! Thank you so much life saver!!!,2
"Great service, prices, coverage and respect for the customer.  I don’t have one negative comment about the experience of changing to TMobile from Att.  Hands down this Boulder T Mobile team knew their products and worked to find a solution that worked for me.  The branch location is on 28!  The store is clean and the managers and entire team worked together.",2

"My Galaxy S7 Edge lost the Messages icon on the screen. I called 611 and spoke by phone with an expert. He was unable to fix the problem. I went today to the T Mobile store at 10259 S. Post Oak in Houston. I was very satisfied with the team. I was assisted by Monica who was very motivated to solve my problem. She spent lots of time trying to figure out the resolution. Soon other team members assisted her, including Yuri. They all did google searches, brainstormed, and refused to give up. Monica and her support team solved my problem. I left feeling great about their respect of Covid, their fund of knowledge, and their desire to resolve my problem.",2
"A Young lady Named:Meldina,is the smartest customer service Professional Tech I have had the Pleasure to get My Migration service from Sprint to T-Mobile, Her intelligence is far above these hahoo's in the T-MOBILE phone centers told me I could not move all six phones over unless my daughter who was in Virginia, and my daughter who lives in Huntsville Texas, they said we all had to be in the store at the same time, this young lady did it over the phone in her office wow, I moved six phones from Sprint to T-Mobile and she did not make one mistake first time everything worked all six phones that is incredible thank you Meldina; (of T-MOBILE'S Experts)you're the best.!!! I hope you're the top paid expert there because you should be!!!!💰😁📱💙.",2
"I visited the Baxter Ave Store IN Louisville Ky this morning. Daniel went out of his way to listen to my problem. He clearly explained my options. When I returned with my SD card that I bought elsewhere, he gladly took my phone apart and installed the new SD card. He is very kind and knowledgeable. If I ever had any difficulty again I will see if I can find Daniel. Thanks Daniel!",2
"I am happy to say that I had an excellent experience at T-Mobile on US 19 N Palm Harbor. I am in the age of seniors and really do not have a good hold on all the updated phone perks that is offered now days. Hanisha Watson, the Retail Store Manager, was more than helpful in explaining what phone I needed to accommodate my needs and stay within my budget. She spent 1.5 hours without rushing me to assist with making the right decision. I am most grateful for her knowledge and guidance. Her reassurance to assist me in the future was very comforting. Thank you Hanisha...you are the best! Barbara Ruthberg",2
Although I don't have a T mobile account I needed a screen protector. Verizon wounded help me. Ronnie and Rob at the center Valley PA store were very helpful. They did my screen protector and actually helped me with my phone contacts which Verizon didn't. I had a great customer service experience.,2

"I've had T mobile 5 years. They are the best. Not only the best service, but they contributed in a BIG way to those in lockdown during this Covid pandemic at my husband's Nursing Home. The wifi was weak, and everyone there, all 300, were having problems from time to time with a weak wifi. T mobile placed a black box "" booster"" thingy in my husband's room, and everyone now has better wifi thanks to T mobile. Even those not using T mobile because it boosts the house wifi. NOW, people who never get visits from family due to quarantine get "" face time"" better and longer phone time to family they haven't visited since February ! Very important ! Thank you T Mobile for your contribution to the seniors during these harder times. And thank you for great phone service on my phone as well!",2
"I would like to give kudos to Stacy at store 3059. She is professional, respectful and knowledgeable about troubleshooting and solving the problems I had with my phone. She's truly an asset to your company.",2
Kudos and thanks to Ashley and Shala at store #40 who went above and beyond to help me set up my new phone and my husband's older phone. They were friendly and patient even when presented with obstacles. A good experience for a new T-mobile customer.,2
So Richard from T-Mobile at valley fair mall was very helpful! He help me and my mom figure out which kind of tablet to get and was multitasking helping out another lady that has came in before and he was quick about it.,2
"Had an issue with my phone and Tommy, located at the Plano store was kind and very helpful.   He fixed the issue and explained how I can fix it should it happen again.  Thank you Tommy.  You provided wonderful customer service!",2
"Thanks to Nadia and Maria at T-mobile, Jefferson Davis hwy! These girls spent a lot of time making things great for my son and myself! They are both rock stars and are definitely on their game! We will just stop in to say Hi, because these girls made a great impression on both of us! Above and beyond! You have our service for life and we will probably be switching our cable as well! Thanx again!",2
"I had an inquiry about SIM card replacement. Truly expected an automated response, did get a person though. It was via chat, 7:02pm NY time, anyhow, she was so pleasant, gave me the info. I asked if I could do it in store versus online so I can have my SIM card replaced by someone who actually knows what they are doing. She let me know the total would go up by $10- which is reasonable and if we were still good? What?! She actually did a mental check in with me?! I know our interaction was brief, but after all day on the phone for work myself with a high target, fast paced demand, this little check in was so personable and very welcoming. Liaa, you managed in just seconds to deliver awesome service. Did her job, but added that human touch. Never know who may be on the other side of the screen (as in us customers), and she delivered.",2
I had some trouble  with my phone randomly  dropping calls so I went to go see Joshua  at T-mobile.  not only did he fix the issues but he saved me $50 a  month from my bill. Great customer service and a friendly  atmosphere.,2
Anteon at the T Mobile Store 114 in Cedar Rapids Iowa was great! Hats off to you Brother!,2
"I have only had good experiences with T-Mobileany time there has been a problem so far the custamer Service has been very good.The Cell Service has been pretty good overall its an A compaired to Verizon which i had for Years and quickly declined with NO Customer Service and  with out Notice adding Charges they had clearly documented but thir excuse is its charged to your account""You didnt say anything so you will not get a refund because not seeing the over charge means you agreed to our Stealing from you""Any issues have been quickly without augument resolved Honestly.......( Yes! Honestly) Who does that now?  Generously always to my benafit and with respect on the first call.This is why if T-Mobile keeps it up I will be a life long PartnerSo much so I bought Stock in the Company.",2
"Excellent Customer Service, extremely helpful and understanding during the pandemic... would highly recommend T-MOBILE as a mobile carrier!!",2
"This review on Store # 1645 at Metrocenter location;Let me start out by saying, I was a customer of Verizon for 21 years but Verizon  rates are outrageous for plans now. Coverage for wi fi in my area where I live in a mobile court is bad. Verizon unlimited was out of range as competitors & too many Surcharges added on to cost per month.I looked to TMobile & found exactly what I needed. Seniors  rates, unlimited  everything, could keep my old phone number & I needed to buy new phones anyway because ours were outdated.  TMobile has phones that are 50% off & some free phones depending on plan. For me, I am a senior, retired, on fixed income, needed to lower costs per month.TMobile has everything I needed, at best low rates per line, & bought found 2 phones. My husband only wanted standard new flip mobile phone but I wanted High Tech, 2020 model phone with all the best everything a phone could offer.I bought, Samsung A71 5G.I got it 50% off right now with Senior 55+ Essential  plan, unlimited everything 2 lines.$55 + taxes with Autopay. Per mo.I called the store first to find out if phones I wanted were in stock, a lady Sandra said she had them & would put them aside for us till I could come in.When I went to store Sandra was there, recalled who I was & had the phones waiting there for me. She helped me pick out best choices that would fit for my needs. TMobile has a lot of price ranges to choose  from with phones accessories but Sandra listened to me & helped me choose just what I had said I wanted in my budgeting range. Sandra also made all transfers from old phones to new ones, even keeping same phone numbers. She put all accessories I bought on phones, & let me pick from vary of colors & styles I was looking for.Sandra was excellent in her willingness to help me in anyway I needed. She set up all transfers of photos & contacts & apps, etc. that I asked her to do. She took her time,  wrote out all info I needed to do with me for use when I get home to follow up on. Her customer friendly behavior was by far,""Outstanding""!.I felt after I left store I had the best service for my money & felt like I was assured if I needed anything else from TMobile I would get  supportive quality services here.I am grateful for taking the move to TMobile.Thank you Sandra, & associate Ben, for your service.Sincerely,Sherrie &Dennis P",2
Issues slow or no service.  called talked to Keith in Alabama. What a nice guy. all is good.,2
"I had a billing issue that customer service was not able to fully handle. I asked for the corporate office email and wrote a brief detailed complaint with proof of my billing issue. I was contacted the next day by Vanessa with the corporate office who was excellent, she helped solve my issue and was very helpful, knowledgeable and curious. Thank you, Salimah",2
"Decided to leave Sprint before the rush.  Went to the T Mobile store at N 14th St & Citizens Blvd, Leesburg, Fl.  Met with Briana and Renee.  Bought two Galaxy A71 5G phones and service.  Our plan even beats out our old Sprint plan.  All information in our 6 year old phones transferred with no problem.  The whole process took about 30 minutes. Phones work perfectly.  Service is great.  No regrets.  Many thanks to Briana and Renee for the service and conversation.",2
"Kylie and Brian in Portland Tennessee branch. Are the reason why I will continue to be a T Mobile customer! Superior customer service. Some may say it’s their job to take care of a customer, but they went above and beyond! It wasn’t just their job it was their character! They truly know good customer service",2
"I have had T-Mobile for years, and absolutely no complaints.",2
"We have been T-Mobile customers for 2 years. Today we visited the store on 37th Ave SW Flagler St, Miami, Fl. We needed help with some apps. The associate who took care of us, José, was cordial, helpful, very knowledgeable, quick to explain our issues, pleasant and answered all our questions without hurry. We are in business ourselves so customer service matters greatly when we seek assistance. Jose has an excellent customer service attitude. We left the store very happy and will go back to see him for all our mobile service needs. We give a 10 in overall relaxed atmosphere to this store, no rush till we had all our concerns resolved. Thank you!!Grisel Garcia",2
Jason at the store on Kellogg and Rock is awesome. His customer service skills are great!! He helped me so much today and got me serviced with a sweet phone. 10 stars for Jason!!,2
I would like  to start out by saying that I’ve been a T-Mobile customer a little over 2 years and I’ve always had great experiences with T-Mobile however to day I received exceptional customer service from JASMINE she went above and beyond to help me with a very troublesome situation I was dealing with from the insurance provider assurant JASMINE  did a 3rd party call and stayed on the line for over 30 min until she was able to rectify a problem on assurants behalf that they weren’t willing to help even though they are the ones who were not able to fulfill their end of the bargain and send me a device within the 24 48 hours promised they were saying that it could take up to 6 months or until they receive a phone like mine do to it being on back order however JASMINE from T-Mobile took charge and made sure that I would receive a phone within one business day and that is especially important due to the fact that it was for my special needs son who relies on his phone for safety concerns and I felt that JASMINE was not only doing her job but that she truly cared about the difficult situation I was dealing with and it meant so much to me and I will definitely stay with T-Mobile and their wonder staff !!!,2
I have used TMobile since they were even named T Mobile. They were called Sun Com.  I have found them to ALWAYS be cooperative and do everything in their power to help anyway needed. I would never change from T Mobile just because of their wonderful customer's service@,2
"Here's a breath of fresh air when dealing with a T-Mobile reps., I wanted to change my cell phone carrier, so I stop at 624 Tyvola Rd Ste.104 location for business.  Customer service was excellent from the store manager - Alfredo and Luz the cell phone rep.  These two individuals know their jobs..meaning I was porting over (Six Lines) over from two different carriers and they know how to transfer all of my phones which were different with no problems...and that was quite impressive!!! The manager Alfredo gave me some unbelievable deals that would include taxes if I  left AT&T, and do business with T-Mobile.  So, if you are needing excellent customer service, and knowledgeable rep.  working, and helping you, and possibly get you some great deals on your phone service STOP AT THIS LOCATION. Ask for (Alfredo or Lus)!!!  We now have Netflix on all of my devices, and I didn't get that at AT&T... and paying a (WHOLE LOT MORE), NOW with all my phones at one carrier, I'm saving big-time MONEY!!!  I'm satisfied!!!",2
I was having a lot of random service issues after getting a new phone. Turns out it was just some weird settings and Henry helped me fix them in one minute! He's probably the nicest customer service person I've ever talked to.,2
I would just like to give a shout out to the T-Mobile store on Nellis and Charleston it's manager is doing a wonderful job and he should be commended for that I have been to several stores and this one is absolutely the best!!,2
"I do not get some of the bad reviews. I have had T mobile for over 10 years and they have been great, customer service, price, and overall service is the best in my opinion.  I do recomend T Mobile to my friends and family.",2
I have Metro by T-Mobile. And so far I love it. Always good signal. The employees at their store were very nice and helpful.I had to call them about my bill's due date and they fixed it and gave me 10gs of hotspot for having ro2 be put on hold. Which was only for 90 seconds,2
"I went in T Mobile today, 3 June, 2020. A very nice young lady informed me of the protocol (mask, distancing). She saw that I was waiting for a bit, so she took care of me as I was next in line. She was polite and very helpful, even though there was a lot of pressure on her because there were people waiting, and there were few  employees. Her name is Marium in the  TMobile store 8681. Marium and Andrea were holding the fort down! A couple of the customers were quite rude while waiting to enter the store. Both of these young ladies kept their cool and handled the two of us inside the store while going back and forth outside to explain to the people they would be with them as soon as possible.",2
"Huge thank you to Allie at the Berlin, NJ T mobile store (115 NJ-73 #70) who was the only person willing to hep me. Managers, supervisors, no one would help, but she persisted and was finally able to get me the credits I deserved after T mobile failed to credit me properly for returned equipment and cancellation of account set-up.  If it wasn't for her, it would never have been resolved.  Thank you Allie!  You went above and beyond and it is appreciated.  Too bad not all T mobile workers are as dedicated as you!",2
"My Samsung Note 10 was not allowing me to put in my pin unless it was double . In addition the voice continued to speaking on various times during the process of entering the pin and accessing different applications.As a fed-up customer i tolk the phone to t-mobile on Rockside Rd, Cleveland,  Ohio where a extremely, knowledgeable and easy going young lady Takara knew immediately what the problem was.   Takara relayed the best service I've have ever received from a cell phone company that on and off the phone. When I asked what caused the problems. Takara as well as her manger didn't know . However, Takara made sure i knew how to fix it in case it happened again and also let me know i can come back for anymore assistance I may need. I left the store thanking God for such a wonderful person 🙏 assisting me.",2
"I met a lovely lady at TMobile store in Hyattsville MD, she was so pleasant, knowledgeable about the services provided by TMobile. She was so patient, friendly and easy going, her name is Stella. She never for 1minute frowned nor complained. Please everyone if you ever go to the TMobile at Hyattsville ask for STELLA the perfect customer service personnel.I give her a million stars🌟🌟 🌟🌟 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Keep up the good work Stella",2
I dont know why people hate it so much.  T-Mobile has wide range and affordable price in my opinion,2
"T-Mobile customer service has been outstanding in helping me fix a problem (iPhone issue, not theirs. Every person I have spoke with has gone above and beyond to help me. They're very polite and knowledgable.",2
Had Matthew help me the first time I purchased a phone and he did a great job!! Had me out quick! Came to retune because I decided I wanted a different phone and came in a few days later and Darian helped me and did an amazing job!!! Was very friendly and helpful and I was so happy with customer service here at T-Mobile!,2
"In October 2019, I got cell line with T mobile. It's 1 phone. Over the past 7 months, They have gotten the Bill correct one time. They have been charging me for 2 lines. I've had to go in and get the store manager to correct it. Each time is an hour to hour and a half in the store. I pay the bill on time or early when in the store with the manager. The following month, T-Mobile claims the payment was late though I have the receipts. Then if any of their experts try to make any change, They add on a fee for that the next month. The bill should be about 45.00. The April bill is 96.00 with them claiming I did not pay 28.00 of the last bill thogh done in store with the manager, a 5.00 late invoice fee though the bill was paid on time in the store. At this point, I would recommend any T-Mobile customer should look over all their bill's and see what false charges T-Mobile is placing on them. I would not recommend anyone get a cell contract with T-Mobile.",2
Please let everybody that doesn't know should know t mobile it is absolutely impossible to deal with you get one person on the phone date eventually hang up on you they have no clue how to answer your one of them has been trained in the same way cuz they all have different answers for everything nothing is ever resolved in one phone call then the next day where you were told the night before it is not valid this place is a f****** nightmare of all nightmares on top of that I wanted to store that I bought for phones football lines court cases and it's absolutely despicable excuse for a human being was hitting on my stepdaughter in front of my nine-year-old daughter and swearing he came straight from the sewer I believe believe meet my lawyers handle on that what I find is the funniest thing ever is it day or telephone company or cell phone company and they have no way of calling you back they do not have any Management on the floor ever not just during is Coronavirus is this been going on 4Ever if you are even thinking of joining this company run as fast as you can you'll never get anything resolved they should all over you it's ridiculous I'm sure they'll never show this review but somebody sorrowful e,2
T-mobile has great customer service as long as you are patient and kind! They helped me during the Covid-19 crisis and delayed payments on my business lines for several months. I have been with T-mobile for ten years and they reward loyalty every time I need to contact them. They also helped me change my phone number at no cost. I have multiple business lines with T-mobile and I salute them for offering the additional features to everyone for free during the Covid-19 crisis unlike other phone carriers. 5 stars!,2
Tmobile is a great company.  I've been with them for 17 years.  Like every company they have some issues but they are still the best.  If you are having problems ask for a supervisor and don't take no as an answer.  It's worth it.,2
"Amazing group here at T-mobile, always wanting to help and looking for the best interest of the customer.Customer service is amazing!Product and service is amazing!Looking forward to see T-mobile grow. If there is a merger on the horizon, here is to hoping they stick to the T-mobile way of doing business.",2
Exceptional service was received from Ms. Selina at the 730 Gulfgate Center location.  Was extremely pleased with the customer service that was rendered.,2
"Y'all are lying, 3 weeks ago y'all sent me a promo and my wife and I started an on-line business and we started to make money. We get paid on the internet, you said y'all would help with the virus but unless you have money right now, no you will not help, you don't care even on your site there is no help you just ask for money for donations to help your CEO is a liar my wife and I were 2 paychecks away from actually making it after the bad wreck I had last year cause me to lose my job, my house, and everything I owned. I simply asked to have my internet restored for 24 hours so I could get paid and you couldn't do it because I wasn't a customer yet. Now you sent me a hot spot and I was 9n the cusp of making it. I even asked to turn it on for 2 hours to collect my money and you couldn't do that. My phone credit is messed up because I had AT&T for years and I could not pay my bill because of the wreck I had. So now I am stuck. No T-Mobile did not help they do not care unless you have money, do not tell the American people you are doing everything you can to help cause you are not I don't care what your CEO says cause he is lying 2 hours is all we asked and you would have got your money 2 hours and you couldn't give us that. I know my comments mean nothing to T-Mobile or anyone else it won't change anything but I do know that someone in this country may look at what I have said and think damn 2 hours they couldn't give someone 2 hours in a time of crisis what are they going to do to us when things are normal. Nothing is what they are going to do, I take that back, they definitely know how to apologise really well for why they don't care",2
I am very pleased to say John187780 Has an amazing customer service! Will defenitley continue my service thank you tmobile for having such a great staff!!,2
"I went to T Mobile in Eau Claire Wisconsin and had a young man who helped me his name is Cole he went above and beyond to help me, he was very polite and the nicest young man ever. He deserves a raise for sure. I have a hard time with the technical stuff and he explained it to me, helped me get all set up and did a fantastic job. So thank you Cole you're the best.",2
T-mobile is a great company they assist you with what you need and if they take long to assist you they are just helping somebody else.,2
"On hold for over 10 minutes, Call took almost 45 minutes. Great call other than the wait time. 4761026 did a wonderful job!!!!",2
Well reading all these reviews pretty much scare me. I hope this is not my experience as I am a new T-Mobile customer my husband and myself. I need to say that store 157D in Deerfield Beach Florida is awesome. Dasia and Michael were the best.. they did everything with a smile and they were patient with my husband and myself. I hope to God that these reviews are not true. I guess more will be revealed but for right now I'm a happy new customer to T-Mobile.,2
"Superb customer service, and we know customer service is EVERYTHING!!  There are many T-Mobile ""hubs"", some with negative reviews, but if you want associates who really care, are exceptionally knowledgeable and will clearly explain anything you want to know about your phone or future purchases, go to  T-Mobile @ Rocky Fork Store #4404 at 313 South Hamilton Rd., Suite 1, Gahanna, OH 43230. This is THE place!Case in point: I want to give a shout out to Darius, who along with his crew are the most customer service oriented, knowledgeable, helpful and friendly service reps you will ever encounter, barr NONE. Just EXCEPTIONAL! Tell them Nancy sent you:)",2
"I’m not sure why the other reviews are so negative, I just switched from Verizon to T-Mobile & not only did they get me out of my contract but they credited me every dime + then some so that it covered the cost of my current bill.

I needed assistance with some information on my project paper and Clark an accounts expert ID 17769277 helped me where he could. It feels good when your carrier is not just listening when you are buying but even when you need help to write a project paper. I have been with T-Mobile since 2006. I am grateful.,2

"I have had some fantastic experiences recently with the warranty program on my phone. When my phone died they made it SO EASY to get a new one, and even upgraded the model because mine was so old.

I thank Mike and Angelo, very much, for their patience through my indecisiveness and giving me all the info about MANY phones, just so I knew I was getting the perfect fit for my life style.

"John Ea was awesome and his coworker. This is T Mobile in Ephrata, PA. T mobile had plans and phones for my family where we all can stay connected. Good deals in December. I probably took advantage too many deals..lol. T Tuesday is awesome too.",2
"I have had an incredible experience with T-Mobile's customer service agents. I had a situation where my new phone was shipped to me and my apartment didn't accept it due to my name not being on the package (this was my fault). The device ended up being returned. The customer service agent helped me reorder my device and ensured that even though the original promotion was over they would be able to credit my account the full value of the OG promotion. Once my phone arrived, I returned my old device without doing all the necessary steps. They helped me fix these and applied the promotion that I was promised thanks to the thorough notes that all the agents that helped me kept. I couldn't be more pleased with the help I received from T-mobile's customer service team.",2
"Changed service from a large cellular service to T-Mobile today.  The prices were better for the same services. Our T-Mobile cell phone guru, Dillon, was amazingly patient, exceedingly knowledgeable, and very helpful! His service was a huge factor in our making the big change.  Thank you T-Mobile and Dillon!",2
"The very best customer service, I've ever witness.

"As my girlfriend and I entered T-Mobile Store 135 (19250 West Lake Houston Parkway, Humble, Texas 77346), Samantha and Eduardo greeted us warmly. During our meeting, Samantha and Eduardo, a formidable and unrivaled team, certainly demonstrated their extensive knowledge of T-Mobile’s advantages compared to other providers and of T-Mobile's products. They answered all our questions in depth including but not limited to coverages, download speeds, Dolby sound, Netflix, transferring data, insurance, and operation of the Samsung Galaxy 10e and 10+ phones.  In fact, they stayed with my girlfriend and me until all our questions had been answered in depth even though it was close to an hour after closing time. Because of their combined expertise, engaging dispositions, and impressive work ethic, we decided to become part of the T-Mobile family.",2
"We were really impressed with the customer service in the T Mobile store, Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn. Adonis identified and fixed our mobile problem quickly and efficiently. A really nice guy. We can’t thank him enough.",2
"Our latest experience with T-Mobile Customer Care deserves an A++.  While the TMO towers are getting an upgrade, in our area, the signal strength fluctuates quite a bit.  Contacting TMO Customer Care, we dealt with Judianna. She asked all the right questions, consulted with techs, and got back to us with a solution. Her level of courtesy, patience, and ability to interpret the technology for us, was outstanding.",2

Not bad service. Just wish there was more coverage for outdoors people such as myself. Shout out to Jasmine(1048498) for excellent customer service and professionalism.,2
been with T-Mobile for several months now for the first time I have had nothing but great experience with them from the time I walked in the door till now they've always been prompt courteous everything they said they were going to do they did even when my phone was working incorrectly and I couldn't figure it out they managed to correct it or have the phone returned under warranty I just couldn't have asked for better customer service anywhere then with T-Mobile I was pleasantly surprised. Great team of people to deal with over phone & in the store,2
"Verry bad service, they still money.",2
Last night went to Tmobile in desperate need of a phone on 2nd line since it was smashed and my spouse works for a delivery service where a phone is a MUST. Even talked to Tmobile in the parking lot before I went in. I WAS told I was eligibile for upgrade on 1st line. The store rep told me no I wasnt and I would have to pay $180 to pay the phone off or $250 for the phone. I wasnt expecting that and rushed out. Went back to the same store this morning and I was in a rush to get my spouse the phone within 30 minutes because 30 minutes after that he has to work. KAYLA store associate said the girl last night was NEW which I was hoping for because if she wasn't then this review might of been different. I give a break on the newbies since there is so much to learn. KAYLA got me w/the new phone and otterbox case for $80 in 20 minutes. THANKS KAYLA Store 8705 Warm Springs & Marks Henderson Nevada,2
Great service.  Always answer right always help with tech probs.  Kinda pricey though,2
"Wow! All I gotta say if you don't got t-mobile or you have another phone service. you gotta get t-mobile or cancel that other service for t-mobile. I've been with t-mobile for years. Great service, fast internet. great quality with Netflix included.I redeemed a free whopper at Burger King today.T-mobile has an app called T-mobile Tuesdays that offer free stuff or discounted events. if you don't got t-mobile your losing out on a great company who actually cares about their customers.",2
"Originally, I was paying $140 for two lines that wasn’t a family plan. I called T-Mobile and customer service representative named Arci converted me to a family plan for 2 lines with T-Mobile Essentials plan which allowed me to save $50 each month on my phone bill! She completed the entire request in about 10 min and it was about a 30 min phone call. Thank you for being competent and caring about my issue.",2
"I had something of a phone crisis on my hands, and I went to four T-Mobile stores covering three cities and two states to fix the problem. The only store that truly managed to help me resolve the situation with true professionalism from the staff, was the store on Campbell, south of Ft. Lowell, on the east side of the street in Tucson. The staff was so far superior than the other three stores that I will now only go to them from here on out. They were all courteous, professional, didn't try to sell me something I didn't need (honest), and friendly. The store is slightly difficult to find because it's set in a little south off of Campbell, but there is a pink T-Mobile flag on the street. I highly recommend this store to any T-Mobile customer in Tucson. I'm a teacher and that store gets an ""A.""",2
"Just had the best experience with Iza from tmobile, very informative, sweet, patient and friendly. Wat to go Iza with your customer service skills!!!",2

"I am a T-Mobile customer from Daly City, California and frequent the Westlake store her. I just want to point out the outstanding personalized service I receive whenever I stop in. Glenn,Theo, Leonardo make a point to help me as quickly as possible as well as the other customers because this place is always busy. They are very professional, extremely knowledgable, understanding and they make you feel as welcome as a good friend. I am still recovering from a near fatal concussion a year ago and I must admit I can be difficult sometimes. This All Star team is sensitive to my condition and go the extra mile when serving me. Even when I was healthier and using other carriers I never felt so appreciated as a customer as I do with T-Mobile. To Sprint, Metro and Verizon I felt like a number and to them it was just all about the money. I am thrilled with my new T-Mobile tablet and their network provides faster than lightning speeds for my devices, no issues. Hip Store, music in the groove and a great staff! The Sprint stores inside always feel like you walked into a rental car place. No thanks.",2

I truly am grateful to David's service and kindness.  Thank you, David.",2
"Sarah is great! I told her I would give her 5 stars for helping me. I know that sometimes the service sucks for people, but no one ever comes here when there is something good to say, and I did have a great experience. I am not a shill just in a good mood. Sorry for everyone having problems I've been in your shoes. Hope someday you'll be in mine!",2

I am aware that large corporations like T-Mobile get a lot a bad press but my experience with T-Mobile has been satisfactory so far.,2
"I was having issues with my data on my phone and it got to the point that I thought It was my phone, though it’s practically brand new, hasn’t been a month yet. After 2 days of not having data on my phone a representative at T-Mobile customer care named Alvin saved the day! He was able to get my data back and running and i just want to say Thank you for doing your job right! :) Happy thanksgiving Alvin!",2
I just hung up the phone with T-Mobile and the customer service was great. I spoke with David and i received the best customer service that i have ever received. If this guy doesn’t get a promotion i don’t know what’s up! Literally the best!,2
I love they service customer service is great they treat you with respect,2

Awesome job by Justine. 110% satisfied.,2
I remember how t-mobile used to be and theyve come a long way. Customer service and quality of calls is on point. Only reason i'm even writing this review is because I had a really good experience with their customer service...I know it sounds weird to say but they were super nice and were all over any issues that I had which honestly were minor. The only attitude I got was a positive and caring one from a Brooke(1240482) that helped me through everything and even said she and her team were the ones assigned to me from now on. Assigned....that means I have a personal team I can go to. I dont know about you but thats just awesome.,2
"I've had T-Mobile service for over 19 years (they were Powertel back then) and have seen the company grow into the best in America (my opinion). At one time I had two phones; one with T-Mobile and one with Verizon. The T-Mobile coverage was as good as or better than Verizon in at least 95% of the places I travel. However, my Verizon bill was over $800 more per year.One IMPORTANT piece of advice: Get a quality phone. When I upgraded my phone I found my coverage improved dramatically.",2
The gentleman akeem who helped us was very calm polite and knowledgeable about all the devices great customer service,2
"T-Mobile has really been successful in hiring individuals that are exceptionally skilled in the areas of customer service and in customer retention. I have had really great experiences with each and every interaction(s) I have had with this organization. I particularly wanted to say thank you to two individuals (T-Mobile employees) who in my opinion have really gone above and beyond their assumed job responsibilities to ensure that my family was taken care of with regards to the products received and in the service plan set up for us. Dominic of the Oceanside, CA store off Jefferson and Avacado Rd.  thank you for being so kind and patient when addressing all my questions and concerns to ensure that I had a complete understanding of the plan I had set up. To Darren (employee ID#122613) in the Expert Care Dept. thank you for your genuine care and with your concern for my family over the phone this morning in respect to our needs this month in being able to maintain our data service plan given that we had great financial constraints that were making it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations. You were so kind and understanding. Troubleshooting, you provided great suggestions/ideas on more viable options/methods ultimately ending in a payment arrangement that would accommodate our needs and alleviate some of the financial burdens felt.  Thank you both so much and keep doing what you do!",2
I enjoy being with T-Mobile. Sometimes i feel like I’m talking to zombies over the phone but today i spoke to a woman named Joy from Texas! She was so great to talk to. She answered all my questions and made sure i understood everything! Thank you joy for helping with my questions AND for making sure i knew about “JUMP”.,2
"Greetings:1). I just recently sent in a complaint to T-Mobile about an outstanding matter. I kept good records and sent that in to their corporate offices on a Thursday May 17, 2018.2). On Friday, May 18, 2018 by  I received a reply to my complaint that a member of their executive support team would contact me right away.3). On Saturday May 19, 2018 I received a call from a member of their corporate executive team with an apology from corporate that they had looked into my issue and had seen that the information which I provided was in deed accurate. That they had alerted the collections company and told them to reverse any actions which may have taken against me; they also informed me that they had contacted the credit reporting agency to have if any  negative posted comment about my account removed immediately from their records as it relates to this issue.4).  The member of the corporate executive support team also informed me that if I should observed any further issues with this matter, that I should contact them as soon as possible and they would follow up on the issue.5). This came as a shock to me for I have been with T-Mobil for over 12 years and never rally expected any form of reply from them – to just one customer in the thousands of users that they have? But this demonstrated to me and was told at the same time by the corporate executive support team person who had contacted me, that the  office of the President and CEO, takes their customers care and satisfaction very serious and that their first order of business..is their customers.6). So for those who may be experiencing issues with their account and have not been able to have  them settled, despite all the efforts you are making,  if you keep good and accurate records of the dates and times and the person you have spoken to and what the outcomes were on each call, when you would have reached the limit, send an email or letter to their corporate offices in Bellevue, WA. 98006, and send in a detail explanation, just the facts, and leave out any abusive or insulting words, and request an investigation into your outstanding case.7).  I am sure that when your complaint is received, they will respond to it without delay. It is to their advantage to keep their customers satisfied and if we can send to them issues that we experience, it well help them to provide training and perhaps even allow their technicians more access to prevent fewer complaints from  matters that could be handled at their own level.8). I have not been asked to make this comment by anyone. I am doing so on my on free will, with no promised of any kind of reward from T-Mobile.Kind Regards – CK",2
"Been with T-Mobile for 20+ years, they've consistently provided good coverage, products and they have awesome customer service.  I was in the T-Mobile store in Riverdale, Utah yesterday had several issues with apps not updating, needing to delete some accounts and needed the help of a tech to do it, the service we received was outstanding!  Definitely recommend T-Mobile and the Riverdale store, thank you!!",2
I went to the t mobile store on Iron Point in Folsom.  I received excellent service purchasing a new phone and giving my old phone to my son. I also had to visit them again when I licked my phone and couldn't remember my password.  They are so patient. I dealt with 3 different people and they were all so nice!,2
I transferred two phone lines to T Mobile and I must say I am impressed with their customer service. There was a slight problem with the porting of one phone number. The problem was addressed and taken care of with ease. I am grateful for the excellent customer service I received.,2
"I purchased 2 revvls Feb 28th one for me one for my boyfriend . His works fine mine however completely froze a week later to where neither I or a store rep could factory reset it . So the rep ordered me a replacement on the 7th of march I waited almost 3 weeks calling customer service no one could give me a tracking number no one could tell me when it will arrive nothing ! So I called tech support and they told me after 5 calls that I was supposed to send my old phone in first which requires me to pay shipping why do I have to pay shipping to mail a phone that I already purchased  that has manufacturing issues . So to settle I mail it in through the store 4 days later I receive a text saying they received the phone your new phone is on its way , again no tracking number that was March 26th . Today April 9th still haven't received the phone no tracking number nothing mind you on the phone I purchased I bought a screen cover they're not going to provide me with another scree cover so I have to come out of pocket again for something I already purchased ! I used to live by t mobile not no more they can't tell you anything helpful you can't speak to anyone but reps and the customer service reps give you diffenerent info then the store does it makes no sense ! I JUST WANT MY PHONE I PAID FOR IT 2 BILLS ALREADY WENT THROUGH AND I HAVENT USED IT SINCE MARCH 6th ! Crooks smh",2
"I had been with Verizon(over 4 years), ATT(3 plus years), Metro PCS and Boost mobile and I'm now a happy customer of T Mobile. I don't usually write reviews but I have to say something about the customer service I've received from T Mobile because I see so much bad press about them. But I have nothing bad to say after over a year with them. I get good reception and feel that my monthly bill is reasonable. But what makes me take time out to write this is their customer service reps. Really friendly and helpful. I call often and I always feel like they care and really want to help me. I don't have to wait on hold forever and they always have some awesome promo to give me more for less. Who can say that they are totally satisfied with their mobile carried? This girl can! :)",2
"I went into the store in Florence, Alabama and Lindsey Davis was the best! She explained what I was getting charged for in great details!",2
"Compared to Sprint that i had they have been wonderful, polite and helpful....also saving me a lot of money.... I admit I have only just started with them, but so far everything they have promised they have done...Thank you T-Mobile",2
"My name is Deshanaye Alexander and I created this account just so I can let T-mobile know how FANTASTIC of a customer service rep they have. I have went through many reps the past couple of days. I had finished paying off my leases and wanted to get a new phone and also wanted to add a line to my current plan. Not one person I spoke to before Kristina could give me the right answer. I spoke to people both in the Tmobile store and over the phone and I was getting told different things. I called this morning and I got Kristina as my representative. I explained my situation, I explained what I thought didn't make sense and she understood. She took the time out of her morning to go through several motions to make sure I have got the right deal. She found out what the problem was and she MADE SURE that she FIXED IT! She got the job done promptly. She was very respectful and wanted to make sure she could do everything she needed to help me out. After the results....BOY DID SHE REALLY HELP ME OUT! Kristina was the ONLY one that was able to figure out what the issue was. She did not try to argue with me, she did not tell me that I was wrong...she simply listened to what my issue was and fixed it. If it wasn't for Kristina I probably would not be a customer with Tmobile anymore. I would love to speak to more representatives like her! SHE REALLY NEEDS A PROMOTION OR NEEDS TO BE A MANAGER ASAP! She is great in so many ways that I can't explain and I can't thank her enough for what she has done for me and my family. THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH Kristina. If anyone has an issue, BELIEVE ME she would get it done. I have never wrote a review about a representative and she did so much for me I couldn't go without acknowledging her greatness. ASK FOR KRISTINA she gets the job DONE.",2
"My daughter was in Japan unable to make a call or text, so I called customer service  at 10:30 pm. I was surprised they were able to contacted her in Japan they fixed her communication problem. I am very pleased with t mobile técnical support!",2
"Called customer care, and it only took about 30 seconds from when I dialed the number for the rep to pick up. The nicest rep and the best customer service I've ever had!",2
The only reason I am giving five stars is because of Byron from Albany. He saved me a lot of money when 6 other people I spoke to were not helpful at all. The only reason I stayed with the company is because of Byron from Albany or else I would have switched. Shoutout to Byron!!!,2
I switched from Sprint which are the worst with billing and customer service is poor. All I can say is the customer service for T-Mobile are awesome. I have had no problems dealing with them. No problems with calling either.,2
I was completely satisfied with the help I received. I walked in a bad mood cuz of other issues in my life but walked out very happy.cuz of customer service. Thank you guys😉,2
"I was really upset with T-Mobile in 2017.  Previous review is below.  However, I waited for the next promotion, and took advantage of the BOGO offer.  Their service has been great, no connection issues, so I have change my rating.  The important thing to remember regarding my previous issue (below), is to alway get the name of the person you talked to.  Confirm things you are told over the phone with a supervisor, and the the supervisor's name.  This way, if you have a problem later, you can say who you spoke to and it will give your case credibility.I was so angy, I initially gave 1 star for T-Mobile due to below issue:Over the phone, I called T-Mobile to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile based on their good prices and the fact they were doing a BOGO promotion on the Note 8.  I was assured I could take advantage of the Note 8 promotion when I received the sim cards.   I specifically asked about this because I was concerned about the promotion ending before I get the sim cards.  The girl assured me that it would still be available to me when I get the sim cards.   So, a week later I get the sim cards and go into a T-Mobile corporate store to install the sim cards and port my numbers over.  I told them I wanted to take advantage of the Note 8 promotion as well.  They say the promotion ended 2 days ago, so nothing they can do.  I called T-Mobile and tried to fight this injustice, and no matter how high up I went in rank, the end result was there was nothing they can do for me.   So, basically, they got me to sign up over the phone (30 minutes) and run my social security number, spent 1 hour at the T-Mobile Store, and 1 Hour on the phone after I left the store.  All a waist of time.  I cancelled my service with them, and now I have to drive 20 minutes back to their store to drop off the sim cards to get refunded for those.  You would think they would do something.  It's just very wrong and unfair, and a waste of time.",2
"I had the pleasure of working with a gentleman named Dakota (5116) in the technology help department. My phone had stopped working and would not go past the welcome screen. Dakota took his time and walked me through every little step, he made it extremely painless. I got on the phone in the worst mood and got off of the phone laughing with a fixed phone. Thank you Dakota for making my experience so easy and making my day do a complete 360!-Kelsey",2
"I will have been with The Mobile for a year in July. It started out a little rough but I am completely happy with this company. ANY issue I have had they have fixed. If you want any thing fixed MAKE SURE YOU GET AN AMERICAN if you want to get someone that really understands you in English. I have had issues and gotten representatives that English is not their first language and they never fix the issues. I hang up on anyone that doesn't speak English well when I hear them and keep recalling until I get someone that does understand me. That is the only issue I've ever had with T Mobile. I don't care if I have to keep calling and hanging up until I get someone that understands me because it's worth it to me to get my issue(s) fixed. I love that on Tuesdays customers get cool deals and free stuff. They don't have to do it but they do and I pray they don't merge with Sprint because I HATED Sprint.As for now I have my bill directly taken out of my bank monthly and my bill has actually went down in price by 10 dollars since I started with TMobile. I love this company so much and I can't say it enough. All I have to say is if you have and issue, you haven't spoken with someone that speaks your language correctly or you have someone that is not having a good day. My suggestion is call someone else for customer service until you get your issue taken care of. I'm not joking, they will really work with you if you put in the time to find the right person to speak with. I have been an AT&T customer, a Cricket customer, a Sprint customer, and now a TMOBILE customer. I can tell you right now that Tmobile has done more for me then any  of the ones I have been with. I will be a TMOBILE customer for life if they keep doing what they are doing right now. As I've said I pray they don't merge with Sprint. Sprint customer service is THE WORST I've ever experienced and they gave me a lot of problems more than any company I've ever been with and Cricket a very close second. I have nothing but good things to say about Tmobile and I plan to stay with them as long as they keep thinking about their customers first as they do right now. If by chance they merge with Sprint, I pray TMOBILE makes Sprint conform to what we customers have with TMOBILE. As I've said Sprint is the worst company I've ever dealt with and I left them went to Cricket and then came to TMOBILE and I will stay with TMOBILE because to them it's all about the customers. It is NOT about the customers with the others. Again I want to say I love you TMobile!!! <3 <3 <3",2
"Visited the Oxford Didcot branch. Had poor experience over the phone downgrading me misold me & was about to leave 02. Was greeted by Nathan in store. Extremley empathetic, efficient, honest, understanding and went above & beyond for me. His service is why o2 retained my loyalty. He logged my complaint & did all in his power to provide excellence in service. His manager jamie also supported with my overall experience. Thank you very much didcot. Highly recommend.",2
"It seems that all the 1 star reviews are because of bad customer support, but I didn't have any issues so I didn't run into them. I previously used giff gaff and my family used Plusnet mobile. When Plusnet mobile was shut down, we all decided it was time to switch to a different provider. I chose O2 and got my family to switch and so far my experience has been great! The service is really good and free roaming is amazing. I really like O2 and everyone in my family has had a great experience.",2
"I must say that not every time I needed a help from o2 i got my issue solved. However, this time, Huzesa, answered my call and he explained why my first bill is bigger than what my contract states (first bills are calculated pro-rata) … he was helpful and sorted my query.",2
"I visited the 02 Elgin store recently as my phone contract was due for an upgrade.I was welcomed into the shop and guided to an adviser that could help me. Sorry but I can't remember his name but he was very helpful explaining everything, answering my questions and most of all listening to what I wanted for my next contract. No hard sell but he did advise me of all offers available to me that day.All  upgrade was completed in about 20 minutes and I left the shop happy. Thank you guys at the 02 Elgin shop🙂",2
I popped into O2 Ashford High Street in Kent to upgrade my old phone. I was looked after by Laura who guided me through various options helping me to understand the Pros and Cons. She was honest and straight forward suggesting things I could avoid which would have cost more and I was unlikely to use. On my return the following day she set the phone up transferring the data from the old phone. She checked with me to ensure everything was there. Laura has suggested I come back with the old phone to get £100 once I am happy all the data has successfully gone over.This service was excellent and Laura is the perfect ambassador for O2.,2
"I was on unlimited with o2 I got advised to on to the 250gb as I'm nowhere near even the 250gb I was advised to be put on based on my unlimited usage.I have the best value for money phone deal/data deal combined with excellent Internet signals no matter where i go working in the entire Manchester area.The people I speak to  at 02 are excellent call handlers and sales teams,it reflects on the 02 infrastructure.Mike",2
I had a call with Saket from O2 to help with my account on MyO2. He was very helpful and polite throughout and was respectful of my caution towards sharing details which I had due to past experience of several fraud calls. Very patiently went through the entire process with me and helped me resolve the issue. Thank you so much to Saket.,2
"Customer service worse than non existant, make it close to impossible to contact anyone and when you do they do their very best to cunfuse.  Trying to leave 02 is very difficult, friction being used to the n'th degree.I guess from a O2 profit perspective providing a good service comes second to getting you stuck on  contract that increases massively in price each year and O2 making it as difficult to get out of the contract.",2
"Customer service agent Rohit is the best. Extremely helpful with helping me transfer my old number to new SIM card. Introduce me with loyalty plan 20% off monthly plan fee for my daughter, not pushing me to join but accommodating my new late starting date. Professional and polite.",2
"Popped into the Stafford store this morning to upgrade my iPhone at the end of my existing contract. I’d done my research so I knew exactly what I wanted and the salesman could not have been more helpful. Guided me through transferring all my stuff which took just over an hour on my office internet. Cheers guys and thank you so much, here’s to another 3 trouble free years!",2
"I have contacted O2 couple of times in last month and I must say I was positively surprised about the customer service I have received. I think sometimes the customer service people have been way too polite, which was a bit annoying, but they sorted my issue.Joseph answered my last call and he switched my phone number during the call. He understood I had a few more concerns and he needed a bit of further advice, so he transferred me to Shayda, who set my spend cap and send me an email with a link to get my free subscription.All phone call did not last more than 30 minutes, so hopefully next experience will be again positive oneShame the signal is really bad in rural areas around Cambridge :(",2
I was having problems this morning with my Bank not able to send otp to my mobile. I then realised that my mobile was indicating no service available. After trying to solve the problem on line I got through to an O2 Asion call centre. The agent spent considerable time and patience solving the problem. His efforts were most appreciated.,2
"Had no issue with O2 since 2022. Recent added charges prompted review. Had a spending cap that apparently does not work abroad (did in past) O2 stuffed me with £66 bill but I guess could be worse as I read some dreadful stories.Update, o2 has rectified issue",2
"If this helps to contact. Phoned 202 and chose to cancel, another list and chose other business. Put through to upgrades and complained about bill charges, obviously wrong department and put through to accounts answered almost immediately. Gentleman from Mumbai was excellent, reimbursed the over charges and gave good advice. Round about way of getting there but worked for me, 5 stars for Dominique in Mumbai only not o2.",2
"I was talking to O2 staff member from South Africa amazing person very polite knows what he’s doing really should be training other people how to be talking to customers he knows exactly what he’s saying and he knows exactly what he’s doing. Appreciate all the work and effort that he did for me, his name is Nhlakanipho mtshal thank you very much and thank you for everything. Keep up the good work and to this managers let me tell you that he a great worker and you know how to talk to customers.",2
O2 Kingston Bentalls CentreIf you’ve tech things to solveI highly recommend the kind professional helpOf AJ (Alexander) Assistant Manager at O2He embraced connectivity issue keenly& took time to stay with the situation untilhe found a way to resolve thingsSimply wouldn’t let go until he found the solutionThanks AJ,2
"Great efficient, warm and friendly service from Daphne at 02 branch just now. Resolved issue super quickly. Was outside as shutters opened and she offered nice welcoming friendly service with smile to myself and another gentleman. Exactly what you want from customer service.",2
Great service from Alex at Wakefield 02 store always helpful and sorted things out for usWhen something didn’t go right he did t fob me off he dealt with it himself and made sure all completed would thoroughly recommend him lovely guy thanks Alex,2
Recently stopped to O2 as my contract with 3 had come to an end and they were charging outrageous roaming charges for when I am in Europe. Now for under £10 a month I have free roaming in Europe and a smooth transfer of my mobile number.I buy my own phones and have sim only deals which is the way to go!,2
"My initial contact with O2 was terrible as i was speaking to handlers from abroad who didn’t understand what I was saying and we’re trying to hard sell me products. However, My call was eventually handled by a gentleman called Shervan - he was from Manchester. He was fantastic at understanding my issues and resolved them with his obvious knowledge on O2 products and services, patience, and care. He talked me through my options and provided excellent advice and didn’t push me to buy anything - but made me feel comfortable and confident to purchase an upgrade. I thank him.",2
Called to O2 shop in Abbeycentre Newtownabbey today for a quick query on using my phone abroad. Craig could not have been more helpful he even fixed a glitch on my phone while he was at it!Just as Customer Service should be.,2
"Reymar John, you’ve been fantastic! Your service was outstanding, you listened to every single query and delivery exceptional customer service and handled all discrepancies and queries with ease! 10/10 service thank you!",2
Lacking in knowledge of what my next moves were when my contract was ending I didn't want to rush anything so I wanted to just do a sim only contract. After speaking with Nick and him going through a few different options as well as filling in the gaps in my knowledge he showed me a great deal and even wiped the remainder of my device plan. An absolute pleasure to speak to and if I could have given Nick a 6 star rating I would have,2
"A massive shout out to the staff of the O2 store in Workington today . Their patience has to be applauded for the complex cases I witnessed today including mine while working understaffed . All worked effectively as a team but my big shout out goes to Jan - you are an asset to the store, keep up the good work guys",2
After a very difficult morning being passed around three different people and departments that lasted over an hour I finally spoke to Teagan who solved all of my problems in just a few minutes. Please recognise Teagan for being a star and taking ownership of the problem. The rest of the experience before that was abysmal. I also spoke to a lady called Tolu a few weeks ago. She was also brilliant. Put these two in charge of training the rest of the team please.,2
"I've been heavily critical of O2 in the past, but it seems things are improving. I just rang O2 to sort a relatively technical issue, and was fearing the worst with wait times and level of assistance.7 minutes from dialling to hanging up, query sorted quickly and efficiently. The call was answered within seconds of me completing the menu, and they fixed my account in minutes.I'm usually quick to criticise and slow to praise, so it's only fair to give good reviews when they're deserved!",2
"Alisha was super helpful in paying off my device plan, getting a new sim only tariff that suited my needs and at a cost that I could meet, as well as updating my account details and providing guidance on possible discounts. Absolutely fantastic!",2
"Recent good experience with O2. We got PAYG Sims and topped up with vouchers to activate Big Bundle packages, which have worked exactly as promised, including in the Europe Zone.My husband hit a glitch and was asked to top up another £15 to make a call that should have been covered by the Big Bundle, but we were able to get prompt and helpful customer service from O2 to sort this out.Pleasing to deal with a telco that lives up to its promises!",2
I contacted the webchat to try and sort a cheaper data roaming plan. Yashwi was phenomenal and is a shining example of how to give fantastic and flawless customer service. Yashwi went out of their way to ensure they did everything possible to reach a positive result. Not only have so many of my worries regarding finances been resolved but this interaction and experience has stopped me from ending my custom with O2. Please ensure Yashwi receives the praise they deserve. They are a truly wonderful person!!,2
"Upgraded on the 25th March Uxbridge branch. Lovely young man talked me through the process was professional friendly polite and so knowledgeable. Made the experience simple and timely. Name began with M.27th went back in to make use of the samsung ipad offer and assistance as could not download Whatsap on my new upgrade. A young man YAHYA  very helpful polite , patient , professional and did it all for me. Great customer service just how it should be and credit due.Was advised also if any concerns with the ipad to come back in.Overall a very positive experience at 02 Uxbridge.",2
I've been a customer with O2 for many years and have never had any issues. Recently took out a additional product and struggled to activate the free extra Prime. After 3 attempts (phone calls/mesenger) I managed to get to speak to Ryan who to my relief was from the UK and could understand me 😀 Ryan had the issue sorted in minutes. I was really worried after reading all the bad reviews. Panic over. Happy customer.,2
"Great experience in Scunthorpe branch. Staff were very polite and helpful. In particular a lady called Lisa was amazing, going to great effort to get me the best deal and even compared across phone models. Walked away with a brand new phone with unlimited everything and smart watch for the price better than my previous contract of half the size storage 4gb of data and 2 phone generations before. To top it all off my upfront cost of the phone was waved, £100 knocked off the top and thanks to the current promotion I got some headphones for free. Don't have a single negative thing to say about my experience everything was well explained and I would definitely recommend.",2
"Spoke to Alan from the payment team this morning as I'd falling behind on my bill payments. He was honestly the most helpful person Iv spoken to in customer service for a long time explained what my options were and helped me set up a plan to clear my bill. Was a genuinely nice person, understanding and not patronising at all which I think you need when trying to sort out debt.",2
"I recently got the latest and greatest iPhone via o2, and the process of renewing my contract, and getting a great deal including a free Disney + package, made everything just that little bit sweeter. The agent I dealt with was very professional and polite, even when the line dropped (my fault) he made sure to drop me an email to conclude what we were discussing. Would highly recommend o2.",2
"Went into Cheltenham’s store yesterday as my brother in law, who has a degree of learning difficulties, SIM card was blocked. I have got to give a huge shout out to OLIVER who helped us get through the red tape and resolved the problem. Oliver, thank you so much for your time and patience!",2
The team at the Kings Road London branch are absolutely the best! I’ve been going there for years and the service is consistently great.,2
"I came into the Tunbridge wells shop and was helped by joseph who was incredibly knowledgeable and swapped my eSIM over to a physical one, set up my phone to actually receive data.After spending 2 days with Vodafone trying to fix the issue and only to have it resolved in under 15 minutes by joseph was a real win!",2
"I had a wonderful experience of o2. I signed up for 4 SIM cards (family). We ended up going for another deal just at the end the cooling off period (due to no fault of o2). I thought it would be difficult to leave. It was super easy. Agent Laeeqah was especially helpful. 10/10 to her. service for the period we had the sims was excellent. Great coverage, great connection, and the best international minutes I could find. Will definitely go back in the future.",2
"It took 4 staff, 5 automated systems and a 46 minute phone call to cancel a phone contract of £12 per month, absolutely ridiculous. It would also be useful if the phone line staff spoke fluent English as it's very difficult to understand what they are saying and vice versa. NEVER again will I be an 02 customer!",2
"I would just like to write this review, I spoke to William from 02 and it was a pleasure to speak with him today, he was very thorough, and very helpful with everything we discussed and he helped me out so much, I really appreciate everything he done for me and how lovely he was on the phone. He was an absolute gentleman, they definitely aren't made like that anymore 😀",2
My names Gurmac Singh. I spoke with Ash today and he walked me through ordering my phone as I was having issues and even arranged a call back to see if nothing has gone wrong which I’m awaiting. He had so much patience and knowledge and the customer service was unmatched!,2
"Darron of the 02 The Swan Centre EASTLEIGHHighly recommended Darron ensured we were totally satisfied, well informed and left more than happy to return.Excellent service and put the 02 in Winchester to shame.Go to Eastleigh for all your needs worth the travel you won't regret it! Thankyou Darron 02",2
Writing this on behalf of my brother Michael because he doesn't have an account with trust pilot but he wanted to say Shane from the Customer Service team who spoke to him  around 5:30pm today was very helpful helped him get his PAC code. He mentioned he usually dreads calling phone companies but Shane made it very easy.,2
"Sorry I was angry. I had trouble to login, but after getting through to customer support everything seems to be working fine. Thank You.",2
"I have been to lakeside Thurrock o2 shop for upgrade, been served very quick and nicely done by a worker called Tyler , he does exactly what I asked him , faster and perfection, , I highly recommendThank you",2
"Found myself in a most complex situation regarding a contract I had cancelled during the ‘cooling off’ period.Called into the Derby store and was fortunate to have the attention of the team leader, Jade.This pleasant lady was knowledgeable and helpful and patiently resolved a long standing problem.Credit where credit is due.",2
There's a reason why I stay with 02. Aside from the brilliant tariffs for being a loyal customer it's also the brilliant customer service provided in store.Wanting to upgrade a new phone Rob and Paul at the Stockport store were helpfulness personified. Not only did they text me at my time to be served (so I could go away and have a coffee) Rob also transferred all my data while I did a bit of shopping for an hour.Wouldn't go near another store for a new phone or a provider for a great tariff.,2
"I called on behalf of my Mum, she was with me when I made the call (GDPR ) and 02 was brillant, they offered a great deal so that Mum doesn't have to worry about monies and big expense.",2
"I went into the Watford store and Bill was amazing. He was knowledgeable easy to talk to, pointed out benefits that were tailored to me. Helped me upgrade to a new phone, recycle an old phone, spoke to me about virgin media and overall made me feel very informed and also like I had got a great deal. This guy was brilliant",2
"Where ever I go O2, Where ever I breath O2, Where ever I get in  love O2, where ever I eat O2, Forever O2. past 23 years of Experience of UK and International  Mobile Network and Broadband O2 made me Sing a Song For them its Best For me Just be Kind to them they will return your Kindness back with quality honest and reliable service and they wont leave you your heart without pulse Thank you Again",2
"I am SIM only and generally it is a good experience. I don't appear to have the speeds I had with EE, but I am paying a lot less.However, and I am blaming the pixel 8 for this, it attempted to sign in to my pin code  at least 3 times in my pocket!!Anyway, so then I read you need a puk code and you get it through myO2. So I sign in and then it says you need to get the code from a SMS message.If the SIM is locked, it's a little difficult 🤬Maybe a different process should be advertised?Update: customer service were very helpful and polite and I got the puk code pretty fast.My lesson is, always backup your puk code.",2
I couldn't access my o2 account. Tried virtual assistant hoping to get trough to real life advisor but it wasn't possible because chat with advisor is available only after logging in account which I couldn't. That made me a bit annoyed and I tried to reach out to complain team about this issue but then after emailing I thought ill just try look if o2 have people working on Facebook. And they do. I successfully reached out to advisor on Facebook messenger who sorted it out for me very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised I thought I'd be asked to call customer team on the phone but no. Thank you Facebook team.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 10 years + and have just recently moved a family member over to the service. I had a bit of a complicated request but the advisor I spoke with, Sunil. M was incredibly patient, helpful and efficient! He really went above and beyond, which is rare when contacting any customer service line these days. I am really happy and want to say a big thank you to Sunil for all of his help. He is a credit to the o2 customer service team and I hope he receives this feedback (and a bonus!).",2
O2 have been extremely supportive of us whilst having issues with our partner company.Unfortunately the last few days whilst i have been trying to deal with an issue with the mobile contract i have not been able to get any answers....I have been promised Pac codes then told i cant have them.I have sent an email to complaints team on Tuesday and still havent had a response.There is no way of getting through to anyone who is willing to help or assist me.My business is suffering as  people cannot contact me.I just find it sad that i need help and cant access it,2
"I called O2 about a SIM card that was stolen from my letterbox and used to spend a large amount of money from my bank account on gambling sites. Justin immediately blocked the card, reported the case, and advised on where to go from here including providing the numbers I needed to report to the police and to get in touch with the gambling company and their regulator. Everything was explained perfectly and I could genuinely tell that he was trying his best to help.The best part, I'm not even an O2 customer, so for him to take an hour out of his day to help me is so incredibly appreciated. Not all heroes wear capes (unless you do, but I won't judge you for that).",2
"Despite the overall consensus on here I wanted to spread a little positivity and express what a wonderful experience I’ve just had with Sue in Telesales. She was incredibly kind and patient with me and thanks to her I came away with even more in my tariff for LESS money than I had anticipated! It was a truly wonderful ‘welcome’ to O2 and I sincerely hope others have the joy of dealing with Sue. She was so, so lovely and helpful. Thank you.",2
The sales man had excellent customer service and answered all the questions I had and  broke down all the queries I had. I had tried contacting the service provider but the other agents I had came across were not so helpful and quickly cut me off as I was a new customer.I spoke to Dylan Daniels for over an hour and he didn’t sound agitated or anything by the questions I had. I’d recommended Him over and over again. keep it up Dylan,2
"So far our experience of 02 has been excellent. We have two different numbers with them and I when I took out the second one the costumer service person suggested a way for me to pay less on the first, too, by changing contract. Monthly cost of each sim card is extremely low, and so far the coverage has always been good when out and about.",2
"I again had issue yet response was completely acceptable and I could notice for the 3rd time sice few weeks when contacting o2 customer service that finally things seem to go in right direction, also it was so nice to hear english person on the other site. Well done o2, keep going get this stars",2
"Possibly the best! Had been with O2 for both work and private mobile with no issues, but had a head fit one day in April this year and swapped to another provider (with a numerical name - see my other review!). Biggest mistake ever - ended up changing back to O2 this week and can't complain at all. Had to ring them this morning because of a problem - 2 minutes waiting, then spoke to a very halpful and polite member of staff (Jay?) in the call centre who sorted it in no time! Now I have a great signal wherever I go, and I've stopped pulling out my hair!",2
"Poole store, Imogen and Chris are amazing assets to the team. I’ve had so many problems regarding the upgrade of my phone and probably spent the equivalent to two days in the store and they were lovely and chatting away with me while my baby was fussing. You should be proud to have them apart of the team.",2
Brandon in the Banbury shop was an absolute delight with me today. Kind and patience. He sorted my problem out even though he hadn’t come across it before.Thank you so much Brandon.,2
"After having a lot of trouble with o2 insure sending me a faulty phone twice when claiming on my insurance, I went into the o2 shop on Westwood Cross and Gareth was able to help me get a new phone and get it sorted. He was amazing and the most helpful person I’ve spoken to with o2. Honestly made my day.",2
"Firstly i see alot of negative experience about the customer service but maybe i'm one of the few lucky ones. I just wanted to leave a review because the customer service today was very helpful.I took out a £8 contract with o2 with 30GB data and seemed a pretty good deal, unfortunately i do live out in the rural areas so signal is not the greatest (sometimes dropping to just 3G). It's a shame i'll be leaving because in urban areas you would get up to full bar 4G or even 1-2 bar 5G in city areas.The customer service was a little long winded to get through to different departments but once you're through they were helpful in cancelling my contract. (Although looking at some of the comments here, i hope it doesn't bite back and charge me extra!!)",2
"Spoke to Sivern from South Africa about setting up a new sim contract.  Even after all the current technical problems O2 have had, it was a pleasure to speak to someone who was friendly and competent. Sadly unusual to find someone who it both.Could not ask for a better initial contact with this company. I hope that anyone else in my situation is lucky enough to talk to Sivern",2
"Just visited Salisbury 02 store and had amazing service from Nik!been years since I have since such efficient, charming and swift service for mobile!  Outstanding! Will defo purchase next phone deal with him!",2
Recently came back to o2 after leaving them for a cheaper service. Cheaper isn’t always better!! Came back and wanted to port my numbers. Had to ring customers services and they were nothing but helpful. Took them a few days because of a technical error. I’ll be staying with o2 now!,2
"I have had to call O2 3 times today due to problems with my phone.  I have spoken to a different person each time and each one of them has been polite, friendly and very helpul.  They all knew what they were doing and talked me through what I had to do in a way I understod - not being tech savvy.I read the reviews before I called and was dreading the experience but in fact, it could not have been easier.  Yes a bit of a wait to get through but not too bad.",2
"Rohan via web chat on Saturday morning was very assertive understanding and found me the best deal on o2 switch up! I can say being the most valuable customer with o2 since the age of 15/16 it has been very hard dealing with o2 customer service team in the past. I think they need more colleagues like Rohan not only did he get me the best deal and sort everything out promptly swiftly and smooth, but when I also had another query he diverted me straight away which was bit painful but manage to get what I needed thank you once again Rohan for all your help and support!",2
"I have both a pay monthly phone contract, and a PAYG SIM I use for a router at our holiday home, and I find both work well and are very easy to manage via APPs or website.",2
Today I contacted o2 about my account.I was greeted by a Gentleman called Ashish.In all my years with o2 I have never had such a pleasant conversation with a man who was very knowledgeable about the products and services.  Ashish helped me with my account  query and device so efficiently that I had to come on trust pilot to thank him publicly.  A glowing asset to O2 and I hope they recognise this.   Well done Ashish!,2
"I've been using the O2 SIM only deal at £9.99 per month for a while now, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Service Quality:** The service has been good. I haven't encountered any significant issues with connectivity or customer support. The process of getting the SIM and setting it up was smooth and hassle-free.**Network Performance:** The network works great. I get reliable coverage in most areas, including both urban and rural locations. Data speeds are consistent, and I haven't experienced any dropped calls or prolonged outages.**Value for Money:** At £9.99 per month, this deal offers excellent value. It meets my needs without breaking the bank, and I feel I'm getting a good amount of data, texts, and minutes for the price.**Overall Experience:** So far, so good. I'm satisfied with the O2 SIM only deal and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, reliable mobile plan.In conclusion, if you're seeking a cost-effective and dependable SIM only deal, the O2 plan at £9.99 per month is a solid choice.",2
"Having read the reviews on trustpilot for O2 I was sceptical about the service I was going to receive. I was calling to cancel a contract, Harley, who dealt with me was incredible!! I had no intention of staying with O2 already taking out a sim-only contract with another provider. However after explaining what I could afford to pay and the deals I'd seen online, Harley was able to get me an offer I couldn't refuse.Incredible service and Harley is a credit to the team!",2
"Abigail from your cancellations team went over & above for me today.  She wasn't able to resolve my problem so consulted with her colleagues several times,  she was very patient & listened to my issued & relayed this to relevant people.",2
"In spite of many negative reviews , I  was delivered excellent customer service by Kurt. He was a fantastic active listener. He found a solution for the issue that I had and solved it straight away. It has been about a year since I have been with this company, I called them several times and they did the best . Thank you",2
"Went to O2 yesterday in Telford and she gave me great advice on getting the right phone at the best price.Have been with them for years and not had any problems, that's my experience anyway",2
"Ola Onwunli was excellent! I have just had excellent customer service from Ola. She was polite, professional and incredibly patient with me, as I was getting a bit mixed up. Thank you so much Ola.",2
We had a big issue with my husbands 02 account. We cancelled the account in the correct procedure. But the person we spoke to did not process cancellation correctly and we was going to be charged £320 incorrectly. 02 in Hempstead Valley Gillingham Kent was totally unsupportive and said we was liable and very unhelpful. Not customer focused at all n not interested.We went to 02 in Chatham Kent. We asked for help and the staff where brilliant. Kree (Male assistant) went out of his way to help us big time. He resolved the problem with help of customer services on the phone and his determination with us. It was an error in 02’s staff and want to thank Kree for his totally customer focused service and a fantastic job. Highly recommended to all customers. Do not go to Hempstead Valley Gillingham as not customer focused.,2
"Spent ages with one of the representatives and got nowhere as soon as Christopher got on the phone he dealt with my query quickly and effectively, hats off he turned around a bad experience ! Thank you mate",2
Just spoke to a lovely understanding guy called Gill. He helped me no end even looked at changing my tariff to try and save me some money. Thank you so much for being understanding and patient,2
I had been receiving fraudulent calls offering half price contracts on my existing o2 phone. Extremely convincing scam with the fraudster even giving agent ID then asking to confirm to them my email address (but I knew o2 have it already) so I called and spoke to a man called Ashyun in your call centre who did rigourous security checks and really helped explain what to look out for with these scams. He helped secure my account and did a fantastic job helping me when I was in a very stressful situation.,2
"Lauren at Bexleyheath store was really help full and went beyond my expectations to help resolve changing my pay as you go to pay monthly mobile. I cant recommend this store enough for the help I received this week, very pleased!",2
"This is a five star review for BEDFORD SHOP- The assistance name is Raima.I went in with a problem with my phone contract, I didnt understand how to sort this out and found the 202 customer service not able to help me. Raima was helpful and reassuring, and sorted the issues, going over and above to ensure I had a working phone, she took the time to sort this despite pressure of a busy shop. The customer service was amazing- I had been in to the Cambridge shop in the Grand Arcade and they were unhelpful and rude- Cambridge have a lot to learn from their colleagues in Bedford. A huge thank you to Raima.",2
"Reported a little issue on my last bill to O2 this morning. The matter was resolved by a very responsive, customer service orientated gentleman, Adnan. He is an asset to your company.",2
"Long story short I ordered an upgrade 9th of June, paid my last year off of my old contract in full (£260).Been sent the wrong device and then a broken device, then told it would be sorted and a new phone sent on a next day delivery, 5 weeks ago.  Ive been waiting 8 weeks in total now and still no phone.I've logged over 10 hours of complaints in total, over 7 hours on webchats, I was told last week it would be sorted and a phone would be sent within 5 working days, 7 days later and still no phone, again.  I can't cancel the contract as they said they'll charge me for the device, £1500, which they've never sent.Honestly just stay well clear, I'm going through the ombudsman next week and hopefully they can help resolve this because this is the worst company I have ever dealt with. Customer service is horrendous, I've just been lied to and fobbed off constantly.To add Insult I've been a customer for over 15 years.",2
I visited 02 in Romford Essex. I received excellent service from Charlie and he helped in resolving an issue for me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable.,2
In particular staff in Kingston branch called Monica was amazing and  good customer service. We have four fraud issues recently she has been resolved as soon as possible.,2
"I don’t think I’ve ever spoke to a more understanding and empathetic customer service advisor! Washiela took her time to look into my account, despite me speaking to someone different 45 minutes prior and getting nowhere (who came across as rude and couldn’t wait to get me off the call) Washiela explained everything to my academic knowledge and led me to understand everything that she was telling me. Washiela was extremely empathetic of my financial situation, explained everything perfectly so I understood the following steps. Washiela is a great asset to the o2 customer service team and I strongly believe fellow colleagues could learn a lot from her. Incredible service, thank you again Washiela 🫶🏼",2
Rexth was really helpful and polite I was having trouble with my o2 roaming and helped resolve the issue and made me feel much better.Credit to the company and contributes to why I’ve stayed with o2 for so many years.,2
"Zhed! What an amazing man! I always seem to get people that really go above and beyond to help others and you were one of them. You were patient, kind and actually took time to listen to me! Every woman’s dream! Honestly Zhed thank you so so much! You’re going to make an amazing husband!",2
"I contacted 02 today to discuss my contract that recently ended, l was not looking forward to the call as l am an I.T and Mobile Phone dinosaur and know very little or nothing about Mega Bytes, Giga Bytes or any other Byte.I got through to a Customer Services Officer called Kirsty and all l can say she was an absolute star. She listened to all my questions and responded in a helpful, professional and respectful manner. She explained things clearly and repeated things that l did not understand.Based on my call with Kirsty l will be remaining with 02 for the next 24 months and l also have a clearer understanding of the contract. There was no ""Hard Sell"" or ""Gimmicks"" about better offers, and the icing on the cake is that l have a cheaper monthly bill and my data has been reduced as l never use the amount of data on my contract.I am happy to remain an 02 customer with special thanks to Kirsty. I am still a dinosaur, but l am a much better informed dinosaur.",2
"Great shop experience from the Ashton Under Lyne branch, efficent and knowledgeable.We went into the store to get a sim only deal for my daughters first phone.The week before a helpful team member advised us of the best deal and as we were an O2 customer already that we would get a further 20% off.  There was no hard sell.The following week we went in, a different team member, helped us get the same deal and we were done in less than 20 minutes.Other mobile phone shops i have been too in the past, i have been there ages and often a smell upselling.  This was not the case from this store.  Good work!",2
Spoke to Sivern (South Africa branch)He explained everything very clearly and gave me a better deal than I had chosen online. Friendly but professional and patiently re explained anything I was not sure of the first time explained.,2
I went into my local O2 branch in Meadows Shopping centre Portadown.  I was  greeted by a lovely  man called Gareth. He was very helpful and went above and beyond to explain my account and get me the best deal to suit me . He was very professional and polite. A pleasure to be served by him .,2
"Good experience yesterday when I visited O2 Oxford St store at a time when they were lean on staff. James exercised helpful, flexible, willing customer service keeping queuing customers informed and keeping the queue moving on what appeared to be a busier than expected day. Thanks James!",2
"I ordered on the Sunday & my number was ported& sorted on the Thursday morning ( it would have been a day earlier but  it was after 6 pm on the Tuesday  I wanted to keep my number. Great communications and updates   it went like clockwork. I was with Tesco Mobile for years but after being ignored for 20 mins and blanked by the salesman there....not so much ""I'll be with you soon or you're next"".. just totally ignored. That said 60gb for £9.99 was a saving of £1 per month & FIVE times the data that Tesco were offering.  I've tested the sound quality and it's better believe it or not,even though Tesco piggyback  on  O2 network!. The app is easy to use even to someone who has hit 3 score and 12... Many thanks O2 for a trouble free switch",2
"O2 shop Redhill, Surrey.Fantastic service from Colin who spent a lot of time helping me transfer my old iPhone to a newer one. There is no way I would ever have been able to do it myself as I really struggle with tech stuff. A great member of staff. Very, very much appreciated. Thank you Colin",2
We’ve had our phones for a week now and would like to thank the team at o2crewe for their help especially Olena and Shaun for sorting us both out and making our little dog welcome many thanks and take care,2
Been with o2 mostly all the time since 2003 my first mobile connection. Always had great service and their local store here is very friendly and helpful. Always had good deals for phones and Sims. Recommended.,2
"My experience initially was really bad and quite stressful. I called on the 16th, 17th and 18th of October 2023 to explain my problem that my old number hadn’t ported to my new phone. I was told on the 18th, I’d get a call between 10am and 11am today the 19th of October 2023 and no call arrived. This is a very stressful time for me as I’m currently undergoing treatment for colon cancer and I didn’t have the energy to keep calling and being on hold for 30 minutes each time. I gave it one last attempt and eventually after being put through several departments got through to an advisor called Rikki. Her compassion and customer service was exemplary and she swiftly ensured my old number was ported to ensure I didn’t miss any crucial hospital appointments that get sent to my old number. I can't stress enough how much pressure this hasn’t taken off me during this difficult time. Thank you Rikki for your excellent service! This 5 star rating is for your service!",2
"Easy to apply, changed tariff a few times (glad you can do so easily), eSIM downloaded straight away. Great connection all round. Haven’t had a problem and are pleased with the quick process.",2
"I would like to say a huge thank you to two customer service assistants at 02.Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the first lady I spoke to.She was polite, professional and put me through to BECKY SMITHWho is based in South Africa.I have attempted on many many occasions to get a record of my data usage for a particular day on November 2022. and failed every time.This week I decided to have one last attempt before making an official complaint to 02's head office in Slough. This information is very important to me because  it concerns a court case next week nearly a year after the offence.I was amazed to find Becky was polite,professional and efficient.She found the day I needed and gave me the information. She has promised me and I really do believe her that I will receive an email before Thursday 5th October to help me prove  my case.Many thanks Becky it was such relief to receive such quick and efficient service.Kind regards.Mrs. N. Thomas",2
"Called on a Sunday evening as I had damaged my phone, ordered a new phone as I was due an upgrade In a few months anyway. The caller had to call me back once due to my error, lack of Information that I had to gather for him. Called me back on the dot, sorted and the phone was delivered 10AM on Monday morning! Super quick, helpful service. I've been with 02 for over 5 years now and never had an Issue. Brand new phone, for less than my old phone per month. Thankyouuuuu!!",2
"I visited O2 bon accord and the reception was good. The staff that attended to me on both occassions were lively and ready to help.O2 network in my house, school, and workplace is excellent",2
"Had a very positive and swiftly efficient experience in the SUTTON O2 store today with INTISAR (following a disastrous on line experience yesterday where, after an hour, I was cut off without achieving my change of tariff). INTISAR dealt with me immediately and gave me impeccable advice, finding me the best tariff for my needs. This was further improved at no extra cost because I am also a Virgin customer. I am saving £17 a month and getting a better tariff! Thank you INTISAR for making me feel valued as a customer of over 20 years (unlike O2 online who almost lost me as a customer yesterday and obviously didn't care) THANK YOU",2
"We were with 3 for many many years and after they put up our deal we decided time to move provider. We looked on u switch and found a great deal with 02 but we wanted to get our existing numbers. Our best option go in store and get help to do this. We went to 02 store in Staines. Here we were helped by the Manager Sian ? (Sorry if wrong) who was amazing did everything for us to do with transfer, account etc. could not have been more helpful. 02 kept us informed the whole time. Thank you Sian and 02.",2
"Today, I went into the o2 shop in York, with my two friends to buy a new phone. The sales assistant James was absolutely phenomenal, he made a stressful situation seem so calm. He listened to what I wanted and gave great advice on both the phone and the price. Overall I am so happy with my new phone.James you are an icon!!Anya, Grace and Emily",2
"As a new mum its hard to find the time to complete tasks. I thought I'd call as soon as i had a spare moment to discuss my tariff. Unfortunately the first agent i spoke to was unhelpful, impatient, rude and had the odassitty to hang up the call without answering my query. So much for customer service, she simply couldnt be bothered. This really upset me as i speak and treat others how i wish to be dealt with. I called up again to discuss the same query. I spoke to a lad called Vishal who dealt with the query and helped me change to a better tariff. Well mannered and patient with me and my baby. Treats customers like family and is an asset to the company. If it wasnt for Vishal i would have moved to another company. Thanks Vishal 👍🏽",2
"Up until now we've rarely had issues with o2. Now I'm seriously angry.I desperately need help regarding a code for an offer that was on when we refreshed my daughter's phone in December. We were told that the code -for Galaxy Buds for £1- would arrive via text within 30 days but have heard nothing. Over the last 10 days I have phoned customer services 8 times,for at least 20-30 minutes per call. I still am no closer to getting this resolved. It is extremely frustrating and time consuming. We are seriously considering leaving o2 altogether (5 members of our family,all on pay monthly contracts,some for at least 10 years) . We keep getting palmed off,telling us to wait 48 hours for an email,then it was being escalated and we had to wait another 5 days,it's now been 7 days and nothing. Every time we phone we have to recount the entire story AGAIN,very difficult when all the advisors have extremely strong accents  and we can barely understand them. Still no closer to getting the Galaxy Buds then we were when we tried to sort it ten days ago. Would never recommend o2 to anyone.",2
"Great customer service advisor and technical team member. Andrew contacted me following an issue I reported with a PORT made from Three network to O2, he dealt with the issue swiftly identifying what the cause of it was and resolved the issue with the technical team.Many thanks.",2
"Spoke with Soco, she was lovely and very cheerful. She helped resolve my problem straight away and explained to me why it had happened and how to avoid it in the future. Great experience:)",2
"Honestly i had been with o2 for years, never had an issue at all with them until this week. I would have recommended them to everyone before this ordeal.I had to call every day since monday to try get my issue resolved. I was lied to, dismissed and generally the customer service I had recieved was pretty awful, I dont think I had ever experience such terrible customer service in my life and it changed my view on the company drastically.So why am I giving it 5 stars?. Because finally, after speaking to an agent today my issue was resolved. She was extremely helpful, patient, kind and just the embodiment of the what amazing customer service should be like. She understood my issue, she was honest with me and instead of apologising and dismissing me like other agents before, she LISTENED and took action. From that one agent alone has restored a tiny bit of my faith in the company that I had lost after this whole ordeal. I can't thank her enough. It's good to know there's still some good agents left in the company.",2
"The member of staff at The Strand, London, store was very helpful in getting my iPad all set up for me.Well recommended.",2
I have a 3 account on 02 and I'm having a problem logging in to check my bills and tariff. I called customer service and I spoke to Harrold from the Philippines he was very helpful and I all the information I needed he provided in detail his very very good…and polite,2
Went to Mansfield branch to do an upgrade was served by Mandy and Julie what a credit to the store helped update and transfer data to new phone nothing was too much trouble.,2
Having a lot of problems over a bill called 4times and nobody helpful until today and a young man called Alex sorted it all out a definite asset to o2,2
Would just like to say a big thank you to luke the shop manager at 02 epsom as a pensioner dont always get things the first time but he had the patience of a Saint and a great sense of humour,2
I was helped by an assistant called Carl in the o2 shop in Birkenhead. I can’t recommend him more highly. He sorted out my issues with my phone and went above and beyond to assist me. Thankyou so much for your service 10 out of 10 and much more.,2
Called O2 on Monday regarding a data query and got through to a lovely guy called Jermaine (Manchester based) who was very friendly and helpful! Dealt with my query very quickly and efficiently! A great asset to your team! Hope this feedback gets passed over to him!!,2
Very good spoke with EMMERON she was very helpful and she very good spoke with me she is very kind and friendly I need say thank you very much you definitely do your job ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Called O2 three times but only after talking to a friend did I discover my 2g phone was no longer supported hence why I was not getting service. This should have been spotted, I had mentioned my phone was fourteen years so it should have been picked up. On the plus side I bought a new phone from O2 online. Nice phone for less than £20. Then I saw my old SIM was too big to fit. This is where O2 call centre in Manila did well. I was told I would receive a new Nano SIM, within four to five days, with my old number and my Pay as you Go balance added. This is what happened as described. Very happy now and really I was due a new phone. The only cost was for me was some inconvenience and my new phone. The service, phone calls, nano SIM were all part of the service. Thankyou O2",2
Very good service compared to others 3 networks I had...,2
"HiI went into the Newark branch of 02 today. The gentleman I saw was very helpful. I had not been able to receive phone calls on my Samsung Flip for ages, no signal bars. I assumed it was because a local signal tower had been taken down in my local village. However the gentleman, who I forgot to get his name, said there is hardly any signal on it now and that I should be getting signal as in a different area. The gentleman swapped my sim for a new one, no charge. I then went home and restarted my phone. Nothing no signal bars.I put my phone on aeroplane mode then shut aeroplane mode off. I had tried this before I had had my new sim put in but this did not work, but this time it worked. My phone is now working . Thankyou to the gentleman that helped me at 02 Newark branch he was very understanding and I felt he did everything he could to ensure my phone was set up to work properly and receive a signal.",2
This is to give a big shout out to Chrystian Briggs from your Crystal Peaks shop.He was very patient and helped me to choose a new phone and contract .Nothing was too much trouble for him .He helped me with transferring the data from my old phone on to my new one .I tried to give a review however it stated that this had expired .Thank you,2
Just done the climb was really apprehensive as I'm not the best fan of heights but I am so pleased I did it.  Our guide was Donnie and she made me feel at ease and was amazing thank you,2

"Customer support worker Nismila  was amazing at helping with my concerns and solved my issues straight away! While being kind, patient and professional through and through!",2

"Jan 2024 - had to call O2 customer service regarding a bill query which was dealt with efficiently, very happy with their response and solution. Similar experience when I was with Virgin Mobile",2
"This phone company is very good, they ate very easy to use and very helpful staff in the sutton branch.I got my phone on contact and the signal is great and I don't need to worry about data as I got unlimited for £26.99 per month.WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",2

"I'm not giving O2 5 stars I am giving it to the lovely lady by the name of Chelsea and her manager who was the only advisor who listened and within an hour she had sorted out the mess the other advisors had made and put me through  hell for 23 days without a phone, numbers that was changed and personal information and data transferred to another phone. A new contract that was broken and the phone turned off and no usage for 23 days on a new contract. I couldn't even phone my family and what if an emergency had occurred. Two phones without usage. The stress this cause me was unbelievable. The advisors who feed me lies and told me that all this would be sorted, they told me to wait first 24 hours then 48 hours, then 5 to 7 days then 5 to 10 days then another 5 to 10 days, and nothing. All this just for a migration of a number. I had in the end had to ring end my contract so I wouldn't be put through customer service, and the quy from the end contract but me through to the wonderful lady Chelsea who within the hour sorted out the mess 30 odd advisors couldn't or wouldn't do in 23 days. shame on them. The lies,the false information and even accusing me of fraud. O2 train those incompetence advisors to do the right thing.....Chelsea you and your manager are stars a big thank you to you for all your help. You know who you are",2
"Contacted o2 via facebook messages, and they re-connected on old number for me within hours, I see people complain about poor service, i suggest instead of telephone call to o2 that you send message via facebook, as I think you will get better response, you also have the added bonus that there is then a record of your conversation in case you do need to escalate anything. however I was very happy with the service I got from the people behind the facebook service of o2",2
So bad. The customer service is worst. They upgrading my contract without my permission and its also a breach of customer data.,2

"Went to the Hanley store for a charging wire/plug, they has exactly what I needed. Staff were friendly and the whole process was efficient.",2

Better indoors signal with o2 then I had with EE, have signal everywhere now, in my area o2 is actually faster then EE although in central London the network does get slow due to congestion particularly around Tottenham Court Road but it’s still functional, am happy about the service I am receiving!",2

Hi it was the first time I had to ring 02 this morning since them merging with virgin media within 2 rings I started speaking to a guy named Joel to do with the fact my old contract ran out I was so highly stressed about the situation and the phone call lasted some time Joel was very kind patient and understanding as I didn't know what to do on my phone to sort things out being an older lady so he helped me through each step in a very clear way and managed to get there in the end I give credit where it's due and thanked him profusely for his help I hope that 02 really appreciate and value people like Joel who are a credit to their company sincere heartfelt thanks again I really couldn't have done it without you,2

Gavin from customer services was really helpful with ending my contract.,2
"Today I had a phone call from a customer service number, usually I hang up these calls but I answered to find out who was calling me, it was O2, if it was something that I knew was a spam call I would have hung up, for instance a company I do not spend money with, I asked how do I know if this is a legit call and the person I spoke to, Nickyle or Nick reassured me by telling me a few personal account details I would only know, I was happy that I was speaking to the O2 firm, upon calling me up he helped me with a few queries and honestly went above and beyond, we ended the call as he was trying to find out information on stock and there was no more to be done but after an hour or so he called me back to tell me what the news was, what a good guy, knows exactly how to talk to people, being kind and polite, I hope when I upgrade again Ill speak to this guy again. Top man, 10/10, it might not sound like much but this guy went through lengthy efforts to help me understand and better myself off, I really cant appraise him enough. Cheers Nickyle.",2
"I uploaded a scam app by mistake and after 2 days of trying to delete this app unsuccessfully,  I decided to go to O2 in Stafford where I was introduced to Stacey who was so professional and understanding and persevered for 30 minutes of frustration to remove this app she refused to be beaten by this app and after alot of humming and tutting Stacey finally completed the removal of this app, I would like to thank Stacey once again for her determination and patience in completing this task, Stacey is a credit to O2 and a great asset to the Stafford Branch, thank you Stacey 10/10 .",2

Bought a new phone and Smart watch. Needed a remote connection between my phone and watch. Called in Rhyl O2 shop and spoke to Will. He spent a considerable amount of time trying to set the connection up but to no avail. Tried again on another day with Amy but no joy. Called  today and spoke to Will. He tried again and discovered an obscure problem that was preventing the connection. Issue solved! Can now use my watch remotely to make and receive calls and texts remotely without my phone being nearby using my phone contract allowance. Both Will and Amy have been incredibly professional and patient the whole time. My thanks go out to them and I would be happy to recommend Rhyl O2 shop without reserve.,2
"I find 02 very helpful. I have a sim only contract which is good value, and my wife and children all have sim only and O2 give them a 20% family discount. So all of us with 02 and we save money each month. Additionally I find 02s customer support friendly and supportive. 02 recently discounted my bill when travelling overseas as a goodwill gesture which I was impressed with (I had strayed to a nearby antenna from a neighbouring country and so was charged international data roaming), plus they discounted my wife's bill once as a goodwill gesture when we accidentally didn't buy the overseas travel bolt on for a few hours which lead to high data roaming charges for a few hours.",2
"Went into 02 in Harrow town centre where i was served by Eshan. Just want to say that despite Eshan being extremeley busy, and me not getting anywhere with customer services Eshan went above and beyond to ensure that before i left i had my old number reconnected and that my other queries where dealt with.

"Adam from re-contracting (also known as upgrades) was fantastic. I called ready to switch back to pay as you go, as my contract was ending and I didn’t like the idea of being tied into a long contract. He was able to find me a 12 month contract which met my data usage needs and was a good deal. He explained everything clearly and professionally. I’d highly recommend him and o2! Thanks Adam!",2
May I ask you to pass on my thanks to a young man called Royston.  He was of great help to me.  He was effective and efficient. And very patient.  Got me sorted out very quickly.  I'm forever grateful to that young man.  He's a credit to your company.   Well done!!!!  From Phyllis O'Hara,2
"Excellent customer service from the Manager in the o2 shop North Street, Chichester, West Sussex. I am a pensioner and I struggle with phone tech stuff. My daughter took me to the shop in Chichester and the Manager there was just brilliant. He was so patient and explained everything in order to help me transfer my sim data from my very old phone to a newer iPhone. I was not rushed and I felt really good when I left the shop. Great Customer Service, thank you.",2

I've lost my number of over 20 years due to EE  but working on recovery  needed for my customers and my cardiologist .  Thanks 02  and HAFEZ . Looking forward to recieving my new phone,2
"I was considering of posting a bad review.I have been a customer of O2 for more than 5 years now and paying them every month around £150 for my three contracts.I also pay for device insurance and although I went through three different contracts with them I never claimed for a damaged phone. Until today. Today, I called them to file for a claim for my water damaged phone, which flickered and shut down after being caught in a rain while cycling. There is condensation behind the cameras. The phone is paperweight now.They are going to charge me £90 excess fee which corresponds to the 24 hours device replacement service, however, I will be on a waiting list until they will get that phone back in stock, that if they will ever get it back in stock. In fact, O2 and I are both apparently running on hope on this matter. So when I told the customer service that I need a phone for work the guys just said: ""sorry, cant help you with that. Anything else?"" Now, I am going to shop for a second hand device to use.Maybe it's just me. Maybe I did not read the o2 insurance fine print? Who knows?. I am sure that O2 would not have let their customers down and be dismissive just like that. Maybe it's my fault for expecting too much out of this phone service provider, and my fault for not choosing Apple Care instead.O2 is a great company. Sadly, I am not such a great customer. All I did so far was to pay my contract in time and expecting for services to just work.",2
"The o2 at Ealing Broadway , Carlean is the best pearson to deal with any issue you have with your 02 account , she is knowledgeable, friendly and you really come out very happy with the service.I actually come all the way from Birmingham to see her .",2
"I had an issue with 2FA after I ported a number over to O2 not realising I'd used my O2 number for authentication and now couldn't access an account. It seemed a complex issue to resolve but the technical help from O2 was brilliant, and solved this problem quite quickly. I can't believe the poor reviews here, as I've had nothing but great service from O2, and they always seem to have the best contracts when I am looking to renew.",2
"Visited O2 store in Liverpool.Customer advisor Ellie could not have been more helpful,she is a credit to O2,pity a few more couldn't follow her example.First class employee",2
Virgin recently switched me to 02. I saw cheaper 02 deals than mine on comparison sites but they did not show on the 02 app. I rang 202 and their helpful agent changed me to a £5 twelve monthly deal with 10GB data and unlimited calls/texts.,2
"Following a major accident with my mobile phone, I found myself having to buy a new one. Although I'd bought it in another shop I found the customer service in O2, Clacton on Sea exceptional. Lewis and his colleagues went over and above to get the new phone working for me. They gave advice and were really helpful. Thank you",2
"Well Ive had the exact opposite experience from 02 Customer services, they couldn't have been more helpful. After security questions established I was helped by an extremely polite,professional individual.My issue was resolved and I was made aware of issues that will assist me greatly in the future. Hasn't been a smooth transition from Virgin mobile to 02, but 02 customer services couldnt have impressed me anymore. Thanks 02",2
"Called in the 02 shop in Wakefield today,I have a sim only contract.Asked if they could transfer data from my old phone to new one.The young lady who I think was in charge was lovely,and while there I noticed how well she treated her fellow assistants,she is a credit to your company.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years and have several contracts with them. They have always helped me find the best deals helping me save money on many occasions! - But this review is for Jiten, who has just given me the best service i have ever received from O2. He was professional, with amazing products knowledge but equally patient with me whilst i was being incredibly indecisive! Thank you for your time and service Jiten.(Sales department)",2
"Climbed the O2 this morning 11 am with my friend both celebrating our 60th birthdays. Our guide was Dan. The whole experience from beginning to end was wonderful,Dan was helpful from start to finish, Highly recommended. Thank you Lucia",2
"Very easy to deal with and seamless transfer from Three (Who are rubbish, see reviews) to O2. Ordered online, sim arrived as planned the next working day, filled in the transfer of number form, all transferred the next day. Great coverage, couldn't be better. Thanks O2.",2
"Had a problem with transfer from virgin to O2. On line help was very poor and misleadingWe went to the O2 shop in Kingsgate Huddersfield. A young kady called Charlotte  Middleton listened carefully and patiently to our problems and dealt with my phone first. We had to pick up our grandchild so she invited us back the following morning where she successfully fixed our other mobile.What an assett to your company. Knowledgeable,  patient and kind. Thankyou so much Charlotte",2
"I have found O2 to be a good mobile phone company, and the call centre staff are patient and helpful.I am abroad in the EU, but I forgot to set one of my phones for roaming (ending in -2973). I spoke to Zethu (on 04-07) and Selwyn (06-07) in S. Africa, and they were very patient and helpful. Selwyn resolved by problem, and I was up and running. Many thanks.My only complaint is that some of the S. African speakers MUST speak more slowly and clearly.",2
"A lady called Afsana was extremely patient , informative , kind and got the job done . Afsana rang me back when she said and I really could not ask for a better person to help me with setting up my consumer account and advising me on switching my business account . Thank you . I will stay with o2 for probably another twenty years happily .",2
"The interaction that I had with Kutala from O2 was outstanding! She is definitely a member of staff who knows her stuff, and delivers the help clearly and in a way that is easy to understand. Good luck to her and thank you! 👍",2
"Had a lot of questions about a contract and I spoke with Sharon lene on the phone who was very helpful and patient in explaining everything . Thank you for making an excellent customer service staff. Yes, the wait to speak to an agent is long but once they get through, they have always been helpful. I hope to always speak with kind and patient staff.",2
"Just had a phone call 10 mins before they shut with Hassan and honestly, brilliant customer service. He was fast, efficient And straight to the point. So so helpful, couldn’t thank him enough",2
"Good afternoonRecently I had an issue regarding payment of one of my accounts (mainly of a personal reason) that I hold with O2 …Well after speaking to the first advisor whom I found to be rude and not at all understanding or even cared!Shortly after I then realised that as a service company that I have dealt with for over 10 years without a break deserved another call, which i then proceeded to make as that person was not the O2 of old (I hoped) and have to say the customer service personnel (2nd call 26/06/2023) I spoke to was way above outstanding and a huge credit to the company and I’m so glad I made that decision ..Well I thought I should at least make the effort in writing to acknowledge that representatives’ good work plus genuine compassion and to convey my thanks.Fantastic customer service!O2 customer",2
I’ve been with o2 for long time never a problem  and as long as they do EU roaming I’ll stick with them,2
Saw a cheap deal online. Plusnet is closing so I thought good time to port my number across. Bought online. Sim arrived next day and number ported across two days later. Data speeds where I am are acceptable 5-20 mbps. Good attention to detail- on the O2 app my temporary number appeared but was replaced by my 'real' number after the porting finished.,2
I would like to point out I had the best support I could ask for from Connor in the Livingston West Lothian O2 shop. He went out of his way to sort out my problem with an app on my phone. Excellent customer service.,2
"O2 on my last contact was brilliant, Craig went out of his way to sort out my new Sim only plan and to ensure the online discount applied to ordering AirTags, he kept me up to date, managed expectations and called back as promised. He is a great asset for O2.",2
"Paul in retentions upgraded my sim only contract to unlimited everything deal. Excellent service from Paul. I agree that the network service can be improved and hopefully improve the coverage, especially with the possible merger between Vodafone and Three on the horizon.",2
"A great experience in Northampton store.2 Young lads Seb & sorry didn’t catch the others name helped us to sort out some issues we were unable to resolve ourselves, being techno dinosaurs! There were no sales, new contracts etc in it for them but their willingness to help and understand has ensured continued loyal business as I have been with O2 for over 25 years now.They are both a credit to the business.",2
"Spoke to Granbel on the phone for some help with my data on Monday. He couldn’t have been more helpful and patient, offering me solutions and recommendations for other relevant offers. A genuinely friendly person who was knowledgeable, professional and above all kind. He is a credit to the company. Thanks Granbel!",2
"I phoned today to upgrade my mobile and spoke to Shervan who was just outstanding and so helpful and polite what a credit to O2 he is, he listened to everything I wanted and got me a amazing deal and explained everyone step by step",2
The only network with full coverage where I live and where I work. Have been great to deal with and I've had really good deals off them as has my wife. Great offers included with Priority too. No issues and happy to continue with them as long as they continue providing the same in future.,2
Phoned up numerous times with little joy from agents. However on my 4th time got this very helpful gentleman.Credit to 02.,2
Excellent service from Nayam when I enquired about changing my tariff. Everything was explained. A credit to your company,2
So got my upgrade phone but none of the other adaptor etc in the order I thought would come together Phoned Shannon a lovely lady at O2 who put it right so very quicklyThree cheers for her She was polite kind considerate and professionalI believe in compliments where they are due There are far too many complaintsGiving a compliment gives incentive as it must be very demoralising if you are following your companies script and the customer is not happy Trying to get the balance right can be hard at times I’m sureI hope Shannon is recognised by her bosses We need more customer friendly people like her Thanks 🧡,2
"Meherzad provided excellent customer service and resolved my issue quickly with a polite, friendly manner.",2
Time to upgrade dayso rang O2 Retention Dept I hope if you have done the same you have got to talk to JayThis guy is definitely a dedicated team player who enjoys going to work His manner was friendly pleasant and polite He listened and instead of urging me to buy a plan that didn’t fit for a quick sale he found me the perfect phone at a fantastic price and ticked all the boxes tailored for me  He didn’t rush me one bitI’m always apprehensive at Upgrade time but Jay made sure I was happy He certainly knows the products I understood and asked me if I had any questions more than once I gained confidence and trusted his choice He is a rarity in any customer service these days He told me that customers are considered to be the backbone of a company What a fantastic attitude only a pity others don’t think the same way For once in a long time I wasn’t made to feel like an old aged pensioner nuisance and that takes a skill and respect I would recommend him any day He would make a good Training OfficerDefinitely an asset for O2 and should be recognised as such He should go far up the ladder Any company would be lucky to have him✈️ Thankyou Jay You are really appreciated You’re a credit firstly to yourself ✈️,2

"I spoke with Sabrina today in 02 customer service and she was extremely helpful. After being hung up on numerous times, she was very informative and helped me resolve my issue. Thank you so much",2
"People only ever leave reviews when they’ve had a bad experience, but I just had a call with O2 which was a really nice experience, and I’d like to think that the person I spoke to will get some kind of recognition.I called 202 today and spoke to a man named Daryl about a PAC code. He was lovely, polite, very friendly and we were having a really nice chat in between all the actual work he had to do for me. I’m a very anxious person when it comes to ringing companies and speaking over the phone, but Daryl put me right at ease by simply talking and joking with me like a human being. I imagine his job sends a lot of angry people his way on a daily basis, so here is a bit of positivity, even if this review never reaches him.",2

"Can't believe these reviews are for same company that I've used on & off for many years. I had two lines but called to cancel one of them tonight. Jake was brilliant lovely guy, all sorted in no time.I've never once had any issues with O2 customer services and I've had experience of all the big companies. Plenty of bad issues with the others. I guess people are quicker to complain than praise.Keep up the good work guys, there are customers that appreciate you 😊",2

"Switched to o2 via a comparison website for a cheaper sim deal.I had been with 3 for many years but in the last few, have had issues with network reception and calls cutting out, a new handset made no difference so it was time to move on.Switch over and transfer of my number was very easy to do, the only niggle I do have is, send a text or email with the date the change will take place, it was only on the off chance that I noticed emergency calls only and realised my old sim had been deactivated.Other than that, so far so good, no complaints with network reception at all and happy with my cheap deal.If anything changes, I will of course update my rating!",2
"Haleemah E - Customer Services:I recently moved over to O2 and Haleemah has been amazing helping me solve my queries she had answers to all my questions there was no hesitation or uncertainty from Haleemah, she gave me different solutions and the best advice! Honestly had been the best customer service I have experienced to date so thankful I got through to Haleemah I have never left a review but I was adamant to leave Haleemah a nice review just for appreciation as no one else was at all helpful or have a friendly attitude and they were not able to help just kept transferring me. Thank you Haleemah for your help this week!",2
"My a22 Samsung was constantly cutting me off. Went to upgrade to a23. Told to do it by phone because O2 shop couldn't access them due to imminent arrival of a24. Thought I had sorted it after 30 min call, assured they were in stock, chose colour and delivery date.  30 mins later email said out of stock despite offer still being shown as available on website. Immediately rang 02 to raise the issue with them [Sunday 19th March] Spoke to Gerry (Jerry) who took the time and patience to arrange an alternative phone having confirmed a23 was out of stock. He arranged for me to cancel the a23 order and stated he would ring me today [21/3/23] between 12 noon and 12.30pm. He rang me during that time slot as promised and sorted everything out to my complete satisfaction as well as supplying me with another tablet. Both products at a very reasonable price. Gerry in effect recovered the situation extremely well after the initial disappointment. Again he was polite, courteous, and took the time to explain everything in full, going the extra mile. He deserves recognition for this in turning what was going to a complaint into a positive outcome. Thank you.",2
"I have recently purchased a contract with o2, and had weeks worths of issues trying to port my old number across. During this time I have made multiple phone calls to the company but not been given a solution. Today, I called once again trying to resolve this issue and was attended by a very helpful, polite man named Muhammad.

He is the only person to help with this issue and I am very pleased with the service.",2
"I came here 4 weeks ago to write a 1 star review as I thought my problem would never be resolved.I saw the volume of 1 star reviews and thought what's the point?I complained on an internal o2 survey and was booked in for a call.I completed the call with Chris this morning.I was listened to, I was understood and a solution was delivered that was more than acceptable. I just wanted my phone fixed. Now I am getting the broken one swapped out the next working day which brings 6 months of problems (with the manufacturer) to an end, thanks to O2.I am amazed. Relieved. Happy. Then remembered the volume of 1 star reviews and thought after the resolution they deserved some praise.Well done o2 for doing what you said you would do.",2
"So far so good. I was panicking after ordering & only then reading the reviews. But it's been better than expecting with 5g coverage, superb download & upload speeds. Well cheaper than rivals & still only 24month contracts.",2

"Really happy with the customer service team at O2. I needed help with understanding the process of switching from an alternative provider to O2. A customer service team member, Frasel (apologies, I may have misspelt his name) went through the information very clearly with me today.

Thank you!",2
"Together with my husband I visited 02 Mansfield, Four Seasons shopping Centre, 15/02/2023 not thinking that we would get our problem with 2 mobiles we had resolved. Therefore, we are delighted to report that Michalis, the 02 representative we met, was so patient and knowledgeable about the product, and it was sorted within 5 minutes, and deserving of this tribute.",2
"The only reason why i'm giving 02 a five star rating is because of one off their customer service advisors called Sean. I also experienced problems with my bill. They took payment from me 3 times for the same bill. When i first call up about the situation no one was taking me seriously until one day i call and was connected to an advisor call Sean. Sean was so helpful and helped me to get my money back and resolved the missing bill payment. I have read the other reviews and i'm not shocked, but there is good advisors working for 02 if your lucky enough to get through too one when you call up. Thanks once again Sean.",2

When we told O2 the customer service woman named ""Princess"" was very good at handling the situation and explained all prodecures carefully and calmly and kept us feeling at ease.

"I went to the Kidderminster store on Sunday, with my partner. His phone was completely damaged and he hadn’t long taken out the contract, with no insurance. The 3 staff there were super friendly and could see we were stressed, as the phone was needed for work the next day. Bradley was brilliant! He solved all our issues and we ended up with a new phone and cash back. I’ve never seen staff love their jobs more, they were so hyped about O2 benefits, it really made our worry disappear. Such a lovely environment, I’ve never experienced this before. What a brilliant team! Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2
"As an existing customer, I was exploring options for using my phone in Canada.

"Moved to a £8/month SIM-Only deal during the Black Friday sales. I was pleasantly surprised to see my 30gb unlimited text and calls deal doubled because I'm also a Virgin Media customer. £8 for 60GB data and I can roam for free, what a cracking deal. The port over from my O2 business SIM could have been better but we'll worth the money.",2
"UPDATE: Awesome service. Take it to the CEO. Our issue was dealt with very promptly by the CEO. We received a credit for the bad service, and they unlocked our phone free.EXISTING COMPLAINT: Wowsers. Lazy incompetent staff. Entered one of the o2 branches and not joking you, there were 4 or 5 members all sitting down. NONE of them got up to greet me and my husband. Apparently, my husband's number is not in the system, yet they are taking £20 per month from my husband's account. Such unhelpful people. Couldn't care less whether my husband has been a loyal member of o2 for over a decade and just told us to do everything online at o2.",2
All the people in the Northampton store were so helpful today. They went above and beyond to help when I had a slight emergency with my phone.Very impressed.,2

"O2 please give your good man Will in sales a pay rise, he is an exceptional attribute to your company and because of him I’d tell everyone I know to join o2 he’s completely made my year maybe you should give him a paid month of for Christmas for his good work he deserves it !!",2
Thank you Rueben for sorting that out for me! 02 had taken too much money and the salesperson did not know anything and could not resolve it I was frustrated! After talking to Rueben he resolved it all in 4 mins and I was credited £50 to my account just like that big up to this man he is customer focused and polite and listens to customers frustration thank you again Rueben your the man,2
Always decent renewal offers on. Good customer service via phone too.,2
"Excellent so far, moved three contracts from Vodafone to O2 and couldn't be happier.",2
"All my PAYG credit had disappeared and the top up card machine at my local garage kept saying ""Invalid Product Config"" whatever that means.  Got through to Customer Service within three minutes (!) and the chap I spoke to was loud and clear.  He quickly identified the problem as the settings on my new phone, he rang me back on my landline and talked me through resetting my new phone.  He then spoke to his manager and restored most of my lost phone credit. Brilliant, if only all customer service was like this.  Thank you M.....",2
"All good so far. Reception has improved over the years as ten years ago I couldn’t get any signal at my house, now get 2 or 3 bars. Got good deal for new phone, 30gb and unlimited texts and calls for £23. Signed up to airtime rewards using code E977QRRT and nearly up to £10 off this months bill",2
"I’ve been with 02 UK for years and I cant fault them. They send me an email every month with my bill total which usually doesn’t vary much unless I make some calls when I’m on holiday in the US or wherever. No fuss, amount taken by Direct Debit and no unwanted junk mail by email or post.  A very happy customer.",2
"excellent customer service, benefits/rewards and phone coverage. I have been with o2 since I was 13 as a child on a family plan and now 6 years on my own account every year they seem to get better and offer more. I recently changed contract and thought I should leave a review as customer service in the UK is disgusting at the moment but o2 seems to have got it right!as someone that travels a lot out of the Eu, they are excellent and have always been reasonable.",2
"I had run out of data and telephoned O2 for advice and help.  I was dealt with in a very professional manner, asking about my O2 preferences and informing me of certain contractual arrangements.  I spoke to three customer advisors, but only have the name of the first, who was David.  He said that, after thoroughly explaining various aspects of the contract, that he would send a new SIM out to me.  He was patients and professional - thank you.All those who helped me were very good - Ta!",2
Although having being lied to and the phone put down on me I wanted to give some feedback to Saira in the South African office. Honestly she was a pleasure to deal with. She listened to my problem and sorted it within a few minutes. Her can do attitude and efficiency in dealing with my prolem should be commended. Please pass my thanx to her and make sure her managers are aware. She has restored my faith with O2.,2
This 5 star review is for the Customer Service Agent called Temoor.  He was bloomin fantastic. He went above and beyond to help me with my upgrade as I had been on the phone for over half an hour being fobbed off by 3/4 other customer service people.  He is a credit to your company and you should give him the reward he deserves. Thank you Temoor. You Sir are a legend.,2
"I popped in the Poole store today and spoke with Jake, unfortunately for Jake he had me as the customer, I am not tech savvy one bit. He was the most helpful and patient advisor that i have come across in retail for years. He was still friendly and smiling on my 4th visit of the day, and still very happy to answer my queries and questions. He is a credit to O2, keep hold of him!",2
"Davino thank you , for giving me extra data when I really needed it.and thank you to Armenia for her help this morning. I have been with 02 for years and have only ever had polite efficient customer service assistants.  Thank you very much.",2
"I do believe I've written a previous review of my experience with o2 Mobile.  It was a favourable review and related to my use of the o2 Pay As you Go service.I recently requested an upgrade from PAYG to a Pay monthly 'SIM only' service with of a 4gb monthly allowance and unlimited calls and texts. This is costing me £6 a month.Again I have to report that the transition was completely free of any sort of hiccup or glitch. Everything went smoothly and efficiently and the three call centre advisors ( Sana and Channel and Vanessa) to whom I spoke when setting up the new account were absolutely fine - one was operating from the UK call centre and the other two were in the South Africa call centre and the call quality was fine.  All were helpful and well informed and, where appropriate, kept their promises regarding calling me back etc.I honestly have no complaints at all. However the vast majority of reviewers here have other thoughts on the matter and I must conclude that it's time o2 did something to address this dreadful situation where so very many people are NOT satisfied.",2
"Seen so many negative reviews of O2, so wanted to at least offer some light from my own personal experience. I can't speak for the various stores across the country, but the Mansfield O2 store have always been occupied by friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. I know that 5G network is still a work in progress for areas like mine, but do find that I've linked up to a 5G signal quite regularly so can enjoy their speeds. When I moved to my previous house, I was with EE, where I had pretty bad signal, so eventually got to change over to O2 whose signal was spot on. Where I live now is abit of a black spot for other networks at times, but O2 signal is so reliable for me and apart from the odd maintenance work on the local mast, had no issues with connectivity. Every issue I have had, which is extremely infrequent to be honest has been resolved so quickly. I was recently overcharged on my bill due to my phone linking to a Turkish network whilst in Greece (also one of the only networks that still offer free EU roaming), they admitted that there was an error and was quick to resolve the issue and refund me the amount I had been overcharged. I genuinely can't say enough good words about their service.",2
I had a big issue yesterday as i was moving over to O2 and all my children as well. My old provider didn’t allow the number to move easily on time then i had to travel to Chester with my old SIM which stopped went to Chester O2 shop Jack was absolutely brilliant he helped me even though his boss was reluctant to help meThen i had an issue as mistakenly the Sim Jack gave me was registered for my daughter’s number who is on her own at uni and suddenly didn’t have any service I rang customer services and that was best experience ever LORITA from customer service went above and beyond to sort out my problem got my daughter’s mobile working again and mine working with my number she promised to ring me when i get all details needed and she did contact me not only once but several times if all O2 customer services are of that level like Lorita this company should be rated the best please thank her on my behalf,2
Wouldn’t want to be on any other network. I have had contracts with o2 since 2015 and the customer experience has always been better than any other for me. In 2020 i switched to vodafone as they offered a cheap contract on a phone. But i always had too many problems with them. As soon as i switched back I haven’t had any problems free eu roaming is a massive plus. 4g coverage is perfect for where i am. 5g isn’t really available but i can forgive that considering the speeds i get on 4g. Customer service are always helpful and 9 times out of 10 i will have my problem solved within 1 call. The customer services team are helpful and polite. All in all just a positive customer experience,2
"Just wanted to say a big thank you to Elizabeth from Yorkshire! When opting to leave o2 I had tried so many times to leave but it kept getting pro longed and always cut off. However Elizabeth walked me through all my options is a great manor and ended my time with o2 with a smile as she was so wonderful, polite and helped so much. So thank you Elizabeth company’s need more of you!",2
Visited your Westwood Cross shop to buy my father in law a phone. This is his first foray into the internet and smart phone. Which isn’t an easy thing to do as an 83 year old. The service he received was excellent with the assistant explaining the difference between monthly and pay as you go. He suggested the oppo A16 as a good ‘first time’ smart phone which was what he opted for in the end. He explained everything to my father-in-law in layman’s terms that he could understand. He chose the phone  they had recommended and left happy.,2
"My experience with the 02 store in Peterborough, Queensgate, was fantastic. Everyone presented themselves in a calm and friendly manner, and I felt welcome to ask any questions. The service I received was above and beyond, I am really grateful particularly to Shakk who went out of his way to provide me with the detailed information on the contract I wanted to upgrade to- but also in transferring data from my old phone. The Peterborough 02 team provided an excellent service for me and I'd recommend this company to all.",2
This 5 stars is only because of the help I received from Julia from customer service she has been very helpful and deserves a raise cannot thank her enough for the help give her a promotion or something lol,2
"After previous bad experiences with o2, I must say I have just had nothing short of an outstanding experience with callum with in the retentions team. If it was not for this man, I would not still be with o2. Although I was his last call of the day, not once was he rushing me, but he was extremely polite, very helpful and made me feel very well taken care of and heard, as well as seeming very knowledgeable and he took the time to answer any questions I had with no issue at all! For this, I must say, outstanding service.",2
"O2 and of course Virgin are one of the great companies that have kept free EU roaming! As long as you keep EU roaming going, I can see you potentially driving all these greedy networks like 3, Vodafone, EE, Voxi and Tesco (to date) out of business. How on earth they can expect to keep customers in the future is just beyond me. They're just taking advantage of Brexit as they aren't bound by EU law anymore. Nothing but cooperate greed!Keep it up o2! Providing you continue offering free EU roaming, all these other greedy networks are fast going to be losing customers and potentially go bust. Your gain is their loss!!!",2
"I was having problems with setting up my phone with the new sim, this was part of a new contract with Virgin Media and their ammended service. I was unable to get through to the 02 call centre so went to our local store at Teesside Park. I was helped there by Danielle. She was professional, helpful and friendly. My problem was resolved quickly and I was given help and further information to prevent further problem. I would use this store in future because of the help I received.",2
Great deal I had with them and so happy with ethic support team!,2
"Love o2!Used to love three mobile, but I moved to o2 and now I am in love. You can use your phone all over london no dropping of calls plus the battery my phone lasts twice as long dump three come to o2",2
"I've been with Sky mobile, Vodafone, EE, GiffGaff and Lebara - o2 has been by far, the best choice!Let me tell you why it's been a game changer for me.• I'm with Virgin so can take advantage of VOLT (double data and upgraded broadband for FREE)• Highly competitive if you explore uSwitch, I pay only £8 for 20GB data (which is now 40GB cause of VOLT on 2 sim only plans)• o2 priority app - FREE coffee, who doesn't like a free coffee from Greggs?• App is fairly well made in comparison to other competitors• Customer Service has been great, compared to experiences with all of the above providers• Signal is fantastic, not as good as EE but EE is way more expensive and you get less value for money• FREE data usage when travelling abroad in their Europe Zone (the only major provider that does NOT charge)This is why o2 are a fantastic providers to be with!",2
Not impressed at all with 02 and thank god I am with EE. Went to a shop today to support my elderly mother. The young man couldn't have been more unhelpful if he tried. My mother will now be leaving 02,2
"Professional customer service. I recently made the mistake to move from O2 because I got a better deal from someone else.It was only once I had to deal with the complete incompetence of this other provider that I realised how efficient O2's customer service team are.I have now returned and will not make the same mistake again. Thank you O2 customer service team. I think you are based in South Africa (based on the accent) and could not be more friendly, bright and helpful.",2
"I am not an 02 customer and had my details used to create an account. I did not notice till 3 months into service of the account.(Yeah I should keep an eye on my account but working nights on a covid ward kinda makes that mission.)But the service, understanding and being listened to was outstanding.The lady was fast efficient and made me feel she/the company were there for me even though I am not their customer.I was on the phone for less than 10-15 mins  the auto selection took longer to get through than my actual business.EE,Vodafone,3 take note this lady is the kinda service team you need to have.Santana R you are a credit to your company and the service.Thank you.Santana thank you 02.",2
"I have had the best customer service ever by a staff member named Jade at the upgrade/ retention department at 02She went above and beyond to ensure I upgraded at  price thats suitable for my needs. I cannot thank her enough!she was very patient, understanding and supportive.",2
Vikram from 02 has been so helpful regarding my phone. In some aspect I have been made a victim and he’s been helpful/patient with my particular case. It’s good to have someone of his level of understanding.,2
"I can see many reviews about issues but my experience with o2 has been very smooth and issue free thus far. I have had my number with them for over a decade and I have not had issues getting through to speak to anyone, always very helpful and very polite.",2
"Doncaster Frenchgate branch.Outstanding service today from James and Ross this morning, from entering the shop  to upgrade my phone.They're knowledge was second to none and gave us superb customer care.After being told by another mobile company that you have lost thousands of precious photos etc Ross retrieved everything and I'm just so grateful.Total credit to the company !  Thanks guys.",2
I wrote a review a couple of days ago about customer service I have recieved from o2 but today I spoke with a lady called Ruquiyah who listened to what I said & spoke to me with me with respect & resolved a problem I've tried to solve for over a year & half ( THANK YOU Ruquiyah ). They should give you a promotion thanks again for all your hard work. 😉😄😃,2
I have to say.my experience in the Hartlepool 02 shop was brilliant.Tim who dealt with us was so helpful and I must say he is a credit to 02.He gave us advice on the phones me and my husband wanted.also he sorted changing us from sky to virgin.thanks once again tim.definetly recommend him if anyone needing a new phone .his customer service is outstanding,2
"Sam in 02 recycle was both kind & understanding. He listened to my issue, looked into my case & promptly dealt with it correctly as I had done nothing to damage my handset in any way. It really helps when people like Sam work @ 02. Thank you so much.",2
"Just got off the phone to Customer Services regarding an issue I had with my Pay as You Go Sim. The call was answered very promptly and the issue was resolved by Marcelle there and then. Marcelle was very understanding, helpful and cheerful. I couldn't fault her service and if I every need to call back again I home I get through to her as she made the whole interaction very pleasant.",2
Hi there - I called 202 and I just wanted to commend your CSA Connor for great customer service. Many thanks & keep up the good work.👍,2
"There are lots of bad reviews of o2 on here, but I think that they are great by comparison, as I have just come from BT.",2
"I find O2 very good with their customer services and mobile offers, my signal yet as to hit a black spot which it has not, I’m able to make calls where some mobile companies cannot get signals.",2
Don’t know why everyone’s submitting bad reviews as I’ve had nothing but a positive experience with o2 the last 10 years. They offer great extras such as the Virgin Media Volt On (Double data and speed) and discount for employees of NHS and other companies through o2 OPEN. Would highly recommend to anyone. Just did o2 Refresh with Donna from customer service and received great service!,2
"Regardless of the many negative reviews, I have personally never had an issue with them. Phones arrive the following day if ordered before midnight and their CS team has always been helpful when I've needed them.It seems as long as you pay your bill you'll never have an issue.In an age fuelled by entitlement and expectations of compensation for the smallest of inconveniences i can't help but wonder if a lot of these negative reviews are warranted",2
I've been with O2 for many years. I don't understand all the negative reviews. Maybe I'm lucky but they've always been very helpful with me. Customer service is always excellent.,2
"Quick service, was shown how to use and what I needed. Great thank you.",2
I’ve today ordered a new line with o2… so far amazing. I’m fully aware on costings now and the future and look forward to a great experience at o2… where as at another provider.. remain nameless decide to bully threaten and totally destory customers mental health. I’m looking forward to Being with 02… and as soon as I can… move all my lines over from old provider to too,2
Lovely customer service don’t know why the bad reviews amazing experience,2
Excellent service from Mohammed on customer service assisting me on upgrading my phone and getting the best deal. Thank you for your time and effort Mohammed!,2
"My contract came to an end recently, after speaking on the phone with Sarah Witham from customer services she was really helpful and managed to get me a really good deal on a sim only contract. I am happy to be staying with O2 for another 12 months!",2
"Great company been with them 12 years now and renewing is easy, I have my mother and sons account with mine too. Reasonable price increases YOY considering the climate.",2
"I have just visited White Rose 02 store Leeds and met Khaliq. He has patiently helped my 83 year old father in law move his sim package from an Android to a mobile and set up his Apple ID when he couldn’t today get this working. He was polite, patient, kind and encouraging. A real credit to your company 02 and above all a very important role model for what customer service should be. Thank you so much .",2
"Massive thanks to Shane and Alisha in the Workington store! We received AMAZING customer service from you both today. You went above and beyond to ensure we got everything we needed. Two new iPhones and an iPad all up and running in no time with our data transferred too. It was a pleasure dealing with you, you’re both a credit to O2. Thank you!",2
Am praising the staff Lee and Ashley at Macclesfield O2 shop. They were very helpful and professional after a few calls unable to understand on the call centre. We had just taken out a newer contract with Virgin Media which included a new Sim but it was made very complicated to a Silver Surfer until the Macc staff sorted it out .Thanks for giving me back my sanity x,2
"I have been an o2 customer for over 8 years now, have never had any problems with them. Unfortunately due to losing my job due to ill health, I was unable to pay my bill in full resulting in my services being cut off. I spoke with a member of the finance team, and I’m annoyed at myself for not getting his name, I was upset, embarrassed and slightly emotional! This guy went out of his way to calm me down, was kind, understanding and compassionate and went out of his way to help me in any way he could. His kind words went a long way on a bad day, a customer experience I will never forget! Thankyou",2
"Today After only awaiting a short time , spoke to a fellow Yorkshire person whom is working hard from home for O2.  Lovely lady, we understood every word from her , she explained everything and made sure we understoodand clarified every detail with a friendly, helpful attitude.  Thank you Katie . STAR *****",2
"At the start of my issue. This was  regarding not carrying over of data I had paid for but never used (even though I explained at point of contract I was not in the U.K. for six months and had a Spanish contract for then  ) I would have given only 1 star on here .But then, in all businesses there is a decent and reliable human being who listens and wants to help as best they can. Enter Customer Rep Michaela Wilkinson. Absolutely brilliant and took me from wanting to leave O2 after over 20 years of loyal service to being so impressed it would be indecent of me to change.I’m early retired now but used to be a high level business consultant and I keep filling in the O2 surveys of how they have so many things wrong and hence such a low trust pilot score .The solution is always in front line people (not auto assistants) who have the ability to help and recognise customer loyalty .So this 5 star goes to Michaela Wilkinson on behalf of O2.",2
My daughter ran bill up and they cut it off.they sent me a letter saying I recevie the final bill in few weeks next letter in was a debt collector one I ran 02 and explained and no bother at all recalling it back.i ran back today and got a payment plan in order they were so helpful and understanding couldn't do enough.,2
I would like to thank Ashley at Stockport 02 for sorting my phone problem out ware other stores could not also for being so kind and pleasant 👍,2
"My mum received shocking care from the Taunton branch but THANKFULLY the Bath branch took such great care of her. The managers name I didn’t catch a blonde lady but the gentleman who assisted me and my mum Jourdan has not only excellent customer care, but a real kindness and helped us for well over an hour despite this being another stores mammoth cock up! He was brilliant with my mum who isn’t tech savvy at all and helped massively to get her phone working and her confidant. I hope staff receive good feedback as the bath branch on the 3rd feb 2022 we’re everything a company should be proud of.",2
"Fantastic customer service always received. No overly long waiting times over the phone and sending links to speak to customer service online, unlike one I won't mention. No problems whatsoever during the duration of my contract. So I give five stars.",2
I would just like to say thank you to O2For always offering the best deals but most importantly the O2 priority app.I work for the NHS in the community and there's nothing better than being treated with a free hot drink per week between visits. It honestly means the world to me and makes my day!The cinema tickets are equally rewarding and makes a Monday evening not feel so bad and something to look forward too.Thank you for all that you are offering!!,2
I went to the 02 store in Cleveleys  near Blackpool yesterday for a new contract phone. A young lad called Gaz helped guide me through the different phones on offer within my budget. I felt the need to write this as his customer service skills were amazing. It’s not often nowadays you get a friendly face. But for about 1 hour I had a really nice enjoyable experience within the store from this young lad who was quite new to this job. Training has obviously gone well. So I’d like to say Thankyou & well done team 02 he’s going to do well will make sure to see you next time Gaz 😊,2
"Looking at all these bad reviews I'm quite surprised. I recently upgraded my mobile and was ill advised by a consultant and was signed up with less benefits than was agreed on the phone.Up steps Deborah 'W' who I have to say has surpassed any customer service advisor I have ever cone across. She corrected the previous advisors mistake and spent ages talking through a solution with me.Never have I been told I would be called back and actually receive a call until now. 4 calls in fact. Everything Deborah said she would ring, she rang on the dot. Even a courtesy call that wasn't scheduled.I hope this review gets to the right people within O2 and and Deborah gets to read this. She's a super starHappy customer",2
"This review is based on service received by agent Vasudev on o2 Customer Service Webchat. Vasudev went out of his way to try and resolve a 48 hour DPD delivery delay on my new Iphone. After numerous calls and chats to both DPD and o2 getting nowhere I was at breaking point; stress levels through the roof. He was friendly, very helpful and empathised with my situation. He tried everything possible to try and get my delivery sorted, after DPD kept lying and coming up with various excuses. Though unable to get them to deliver to me the same day that they had promised, (the day after it was initially supposed to arrive, for which I had paid a premium), it did turn up the following morning (3rd day) first thing. I truly believe that had it not been for Vasudev`s intervention and pulling out all the stops to get my order delivered, that I would still be waiting and stressing over where it was and if it was ever going to arrive. Thank you Vasudev. I really appreciate all your efforts. May God bless you and your family.",2
"I have been with Tesco which uses 02 for 10 years and have always had a good reception for calls in that time.  I have broadband at home and mostly use the internet there but at the times that I needed to use internet on my phone outside, I have never found an issue.  I am in Folkestone Kent. I only found that they had bad reviews because I was looking at other providers because Tesco's isn't such good value at the moment and from my point of view, I think they are good provider.",2
"I always find it amazing to see so many negative reviews. I’ve been with O2 for about 9 or 10 years now, and whilst there have been issues, they have always resolved them quickly.Most recently, I upgraded my series 6 Apple Watch Product (red) to a series 7, using O2 Refresh. There was an issue with the website’s stock locator, so I rang the Metro Centre store, confirmed stock, and popped down.I had previously had an issue adding my data plan to a watch, which required O2 to reset everything, and they did that fine for me. Because of that, I set up my watch in store just in case and they were there to help in case it failed, which it didn’t.Wife and I both on O2, definitely offers some of best coverage in the north east of England. I know this because I did switch to Vodafone for a week because when I was due an upgrade they had a deal on, but they had no network at home, or work, or in Huddersfield where I regularly travel. I got a unlimited data sim from Three for my iPad, and that’s slower than O2.I guess every company has their issues and spends on who you get for support, but I’ve found o2 to be an excellent network and I can see myself moving any time soon.",2
I got a new SIM card ten years ago because I'm weird and I change my number every day (and also like false economy s) now ten years on and forty Sims later I need my number to log in to get a tax rebate and they obliged  spoke to a wonderful gentleman on the phone great service,2
I’ve been with o2 for around 15 years now and I’ve never had any problems with them. I’ve just upgraded early to the new iPhone with no hassle and didn’t have any problems with my first ever phone contract with them 2 years ago (I was always sim only and pay as you go before that) delivery is always on time. :) I think I’ll stick around for another while.,2
"Served by Rachael,O2 leicester Beaumont leys store.I bought a new phone on contract and left ID mobile.She explained plan clearly, bills, insurance and made us feel welcomed.Thank you RachaelMr Fletcher",2
"I went to o2 Beaumont store and got served by a lovely lady called Rachael. She is amazing, professional in the manner she speaks. She explained everything clearly and very polite and beautiful. Thank you Rachael for making my experience beautiful. I will visit the store often with friends and family. You are a rare gem and a credit to O2. Angela😍",2
"I would recommend 02, as there value for money and they reward their customers.When you take out a contract with them you get access to 02 priority, ie freebies each week like free coffee and food",2
"Excellent service from 02 shop in Yeovil. Answered my query, fixed the issue I was having within 5 minutes, and with very pleasant, polite service. Highly recommended. Thanks!",2
Called in O2 shop in Nuneaton on Sunday for advice on replacement phone. The chap was the most helpful of any O2 shop we have been in. His customer service was exceptional and this prompted us to buy a phone. Nothing was too much trouble and he even checked which day he was next in just in case we had any problem. He deserves to go far.,2
Spoke to Terrence over the phone from Glasgow. He understood my situation and didn't just seem like an advisor who was just doing his job. He went above and beyond to help and naturally seemed like a person who cared about peoples situation. I got the help and more from that phone call - people who care make a big difference. Keep up the good work Terrence!,2
My own experience has actually been really good with 02. I live in North Cornwall and switched from three because of no to sketchy signal.at homeHad a new mate 20 pro comtract £20 a month (4gig plus unlimited) thought that was very competitive.Still got the phone but went to £6 month sim only (6gig plus unlimited) the changover was seamless and correct and the coverage for me is excellent,2
I went into O2 store in Swan Centre Eastleigh as I was out of contract with my phone.   The staff were brilliant and Graham dealt with the transfer of info from the old phone to the new phone.   Graham was very knowledgeable and was extremely helpful and friendly.  Matt who we have dealt with previously was warm and welcoming.  It was a pleasure to go into the store and have such good customer service.  Well done O2 from a very grateful customer.,2
"We are a couple of seniors who have just acquired our first ever smartphone, choosing 02 as our provider.  They have a system of a 'guru' in post at each shop, to guide ingenues like us, so we booked an appointment with James, the Oxford Westgate Centre Guru.  We were not disappointed.  James answered all our picayune questions with expert patient ease.  At the end of our long session, we felt confident about using the phone.  What an excellent idea:  having a Resident Guru.  And thank you, James.",2
"My father had an accident and Louise from Gateshead Metro Centre was fantastic.   She looked after my mother, called me, supported my mam whilst the ambulance arrived.   I can’t thank your amazing team member enough.   Thank you",2
"I had a very serious complaint against a man working in an O2 store, who made me and my partner feel incredibly uncomfortable, committed fraud and then put me in debt with O2. I called a line today, and was put through to a young man called Steven. Honestly, a call I was dreading was made simple, and I felt cared for, by that lovely man. He absolutely made me feel listened to, he took his time with my complaint, and called me back to tell me there was an investigation going on and I will be updated every step of the way. Honestly, this man is a credit to the company. If you're getting all these bad reviews about customer service, yet I had a very pleasant one even with a very hard topic... he's a great one! Thank you Steven if you're reading this, you're a credit to the company you work for.",2
"I am confused by other reviews.  I had a difficult problem dealt with initially by 'chat'; I was advised to pursue resolution by talking to the relevant department. Everyone was polite, friendly and efficient and the problem was resolved with no difficulty.  It was taking some time so I was advised to 'ring off' and I would be called back.  That was what happened in a short time frame.  In brief a 5* experience",2
"Sab, Olly & Flick at the Clifton Down store were all absolutely amazing. So lovely to chat to, and crazy helpful. I got so frustrated with the online services live chat, but as soon as I got in store they took the time to explain what had happened and how to rectify it. Got me a lovely new phone, with a comfortable chat and no extreme upselling; they seemed very genuinely interested in helping me get the phone I needed. Thanks so much gang!",2
"Reading the reviews is insane. Been with o2 for 3 years, contract ran out as paid my phone off and switched onto another o2 contract, all went fine.I have also just bought a new phone for my daughter for xmas and all was easy peasy there too.The app is fantastic. You get airtime rewards. So for example, I add my debit card and whenevr I shop at say primark or greggs ect money comes off my bill. Great for a teenager too which is why I've now got her on the same :)Looking at some reviews it seems some people are complaining about their own errors. Example, leaving o2 in contract is always going to be an issue for any network, signal is always going to be an issue in some areas, not really o2s fault, just get over it until you move to a new location, people complaining about paying a high monthly cost out of contract, well how is that there fault, ensure you keep an eye on your contract when it runs out change it so its lower or get a new contract, simple...",2
Had a great experience in woolwich O2- Yamin made the process of upgrading my phone super easy and helped me to find the exact deal I wanted. Couldn't have wished for better service!,2
"I have been with O2 since I owned the iPhone 4S (the good ol' days). Since then I have owned several handsets with O2, either by taking out a deal with them directly or by signing up for a new deal through a third party such as Carphone Warehouse.I can honestly say that I have never experienced a single problem with this provider during my tenure with them. I have contacted them on several occasions with general queries, switching mobile numbers etc. and each time has been a breeze (I mainly used webchat).Recently I have switched to another network, only because I now work for said network and receive quite a hefty discount.There are quite a lot of complaints regarding this network, either on Trust Pilot or social media, but the same complaints apply to each and every network. Everyone has their own viewpoint or issue with a network, big or small. You may go to another network such as EE and have a wonderful experience, or leave EE and join O2 because you've have a dreadful experience. You can't please everyone I suppose!I will undoubtedly be returning to O2 in the future I'm sure.",2
"Purchased an IPhone 13 pro online at Vodafone… the next day I got a text saying they were out of stock.. waited 2 weeks but still nothing.. ended up cancelling the order.I also went into Manchester to the apple Store and they had none either. Searched around everywhere.Finally, went to my current provider (O2) and was amazed that their website had them as ‘in stock’… I ordered it and was expecting a ‘we’re sorry’ email but was amazed that they said they’d deliver it the next day… and they did.. great customer service. One happy customer… data rates are a bit higher than most but other than that.. brilliant!",2
I had a guy from the Burnley store his name began with a Z and he sorted me a phone out within one working day it was my first contract and I had no clue what I was doing he was amazing and so helpful I can’t praise him enough! He also helped my partner know about how much he had left on his contractHe helped me decide what plan and what phone would be suitable for me,2
I've been with O2 about 8 years now. I always have great service from them. Would recommend.,2
Excellent service and customer careI joined O2 last week and my new sim card arrived 2 days later.  The sim activated immediately and I was up and running straight away.  My old number was ported 2 days later and the whole operation was seamless.  10/10 o2 for such an efficient operation.  I called customer care to check on my old number porting and they couldn’t have been more helpful.  Having suffered at the hands of Virgin mobile for 6 weeks this is a welcome relief and I cannot recommend o2 highly enough.,2
"I have to say a big thank you to 02, have been a client for as long as I can remember and they have never let me down. Customer service is second to none, this morning they guided me to a different plan and I am more than grateful.",2
"Would highly recommend O2 Insurance! I have had my phone for 3 years and never had to claim but typically a week before I had paid off my phone I dropped it and the whole screen was cracked. The Insurance team were brilliant, very reassuring and talked me through all my options whilst being very supportive - they told me I could get my phone collected at my door and a replacement delivered the next day and this is exactly what happened - SO SO SIMPLE! Have had to jump through hoops to claim on insurance before and this was so simple and easy during a stressful time, thank you!",2
"Been with O2 for many years. Any issue raised such as no signal was easily raised and sorted out within 48hrs, along with updates along the way.The app is easy to use, able to pay the montly bill early if needed or easily upgraded to a new plan.",2
"Got a 02 sim contract,I'm still very unhappy with them,but I'm giving them 5 star, im a Vodafone customer been very happy with them. But switched to 02 just to see how they are, still 6 month and still need to wait for a phone contract  With Vodafone just 3 month and they offered me a phone contract. I didn't check the reviews before I switch to 02. Now I'm seeing so many negative reviews for 02. I'm still thinking to stay with 02 or to switch to another network.",2
Shaun and Travis were so helpful when there was an issue changing from PAYG to contract. They valued my time and were on the ball how to help. Issue all fixed quickly!,2
Where do I even start? The customer service from Brian King was fantastic and went above and beyond for myself. Explained my entire situation gave me fantastic advice all the way through reassuring me everything will be ok! Talked me through everything completely and set me a new plan. I hope o2 have more Brian’s because the customer service will excel with individuals such as him.I got confused a few times and he was so polite and professional from start to finish ensuring I was happy. Not only that it’s helped me keep in contact with my daughter whom I’m awaiting important hospital appointments for. Brian took above and beyond to a new level and can’t thank him enough!I hope o2 have a reward scheme because if he’s the same to me as every customer something is being done correct by him and deserves recognition!Thank you Brian and thank you for your outstanding customer service.10/10 for everything,2
"Fantastic customer service from Karen Boardman. Gave great advice. Although I am a little sad because I reported an aesthetic impairment with the handset during the warranty and it wasn't logged sufficiently, the kindness was wonderful. We cannot take our frustrations out on customer service representatives because they are front line and deal with most of the back office's mistakes of mismanagement and lack of organisation. I really hope I am offered a good deal on my new contract to compensate for the devices issues, however, in future I will return to this representative because she is an asset to this company. <3 Melanie",2
"Noticed yesterday that I had been charged for text messages from Premium number for the past 3 months and not even received them in my message box. Phoned 02 customer services and the lady was so professional, reassuring and helpful that she put my mind at rest. Don't come across such caring people very often. Thank you",2
I had a very pleasant experience speaking to a lady named Jackie from the O2 Business customer service team. She went above and beyond to help resolve my issue and was very polite and kind whilst doing so.,2
"I needed to contact a specific team in O2, I found the details on the website. Sent my email with the details, received the automatic reply saying they aim to reply in 5 days but due to current demand it may take longer.  It did take longer, but as they resolved this was no issue for me. I had a call today from the team at O2. He explained what he had done, gave advice, was polite and friendly. Thank you.",2
"Went to 02 in Westfield, Stratford was only enquiring about the Samsung Z fold, phone as well as the S7 Plus tablet, the young girl Tejiri, gave me the information needed about the monthly cost as well as upfront cost, and the total cost through the 48 month period. It was not busy at around just before 1 pm, so was seen straight away, without any waiting. Service was professional and no complaints.",2
"Switched to O2 this week and I am extremely pleased with the experience.  The O2 advisors were helpful when I had a little difficulty porting my existing number and sorted the whole thing out for me.  So far, a great service and about the cheapest too.",2
John was a pleasure to speak with and gave me the price and peace if mind for 24 months.,2
"A big complement to O2. After creating a chaos in ""MyO2"" account, they not only solved this in minutes, a much, much, better deal and a new sim card within a day. Next day in the Netherlands, within 2 minutes roaming on and full internet.  Thanks O2 team, well done.",2
I was speaking to a lovely lady Gill this morning and she went beyond more to help me and I'm ever so greatfull.,2
Been a loyal customer with o2 for several years- can find everything you need through the app. Had no real problems at all with customer service.I love the priority app too!,2
"I didn’t receive my sim as planned via post and decided to pop down to my local O2 store in Evesham this afternoon. I wish I had asked for her name as she provided me with such lovely customer service and spent time talking to me about the latest Apple Watch (as I am an avid Apple user!). Thankyou so much, I really appreciate all the help given.",2
"Had the best experience with o2 customer services. Joined they're network briefly to buy a specific phone. Once my 14 days passed, called to cancel my contract. Unfortunately they misunderstood what I meant, and charged me an extra month. Called to confirm my cancellation and they were kind, really friendly and refunded me the extra month they charged by mistake.I'm sticking to my current network, as I prefer my pay as you go provider, but I absolutely appreciated the easiness of sorting out my cancellation",2
"I've been with O2 for a few years now. I use services (which O2 provides me with) at O2 branch in Essex, Southend-on-sea (The High Street) This is the place I'd like to give my feedback on.You will be greated with positive energy and smile there.Your concerns/issues will be listened.The best possible option will be offered which suits you best.Your needs will be met.This is the place, where you feel looked after.So without any hesitation, I give 5 stars out of 5My big personal and exceptional ""Thank you"" to the manager of this O2 branch.Thank youYours sincerely,Dr.Asta Galentiene",2
Very happy with my call from Shantal as she very clearly explained what had happened with my discount and then applied for it to be out on for me!,2
"I bought an iPhone 8 from a reputable refurbished phone shop and went to my local 02 shop in Sittingbourne to get a sim only deal, the young lady then pointed out that the phone I had purchased was working correctly but it had a repaired screen that was incorrectly fitted and would probably fail if knocked so she then accompanied me to the retailer and returned the phone and I came away with an A grade iPhone 7 which is immaculate and after transferring all my contacts etc. sent me on my way - this was a very good example of going out of her way to help an old codger into the 21st century for which I am extremely grateful.",2
Shaheen was a huge help after the online messaging could not help AT ALL. The online service would not accept that I only had one phone and all my service were completely cut off. They still insisted (despite living alone and just coming out of isolation) that I had to find another phone and call.But then I ran to someone who thankfully lent me their phone and let me sort this out.And Shaheem happened! He was patient and naturally frustrated with endless complaints and anger and dealt with me so well and got me my services back and even more! He's a star and if O2 don't give him a raise then there's no justice.CarlPs I suggest that o2 find a way during this Corona virus pandemic to allow people to use the one phone that they have. It's no ones fault to be isolated. Thank God you have Shaheem,2
"Just upgrade my phone at the store in Tunbridge Wells. The customer service was excellent, everything was explained really well and the whole process was super simple.",2
I want to post this review about Adam in the o2 shop in Cramlington. He kindly set up my new 12 pro and was extremely Helpful and  pleasant. I bought the phone online from o2 so he didn’t get any benefit..He is a credit to o2.,2
"I had already purchased my 24 month contract and switched over when I saw the reviews - and I was quite scared of what would happen. I had a horrendous experience with Three - no 4G ever, impossible to hear anyone over the phone, etc etc (I won't bore you). But since I made the switch, my life has been made so much easier because of O2. I have signal EVERYWHERE (I used to have just one bar when I was at home, with wifi), and have great network service so far.Also, Asad who sorted out my contract in store in Stratford was a gem. Honestly, the best customer service I've ever had in my life. That guy sets the standard - gold star service, and he's a super guy. I was dealing with Three over the phone while I was switching over, and he handled everything seamlessly. Made my life so easy. Give that guy a raise. I'll be recommending him and O2 to everyone.",2
"I recently purchased a Mobile WiFi system from O2 shop in Burnley Lancs. Had great service from two lovely, professional, patient young ladies Zaibaa and Jodie.Brilliant experience!!",2
I was scammed almost out of 1000 pounds luckily the man I spoke to helped me sort it out quickly and efficiently. Great service in my opinion.,2
"I have to say the team at O2 in Loughborough is simply brilliant.  Thank you Sayfur, Ian, Chirag, Kay and Sam.  If you want to know about customer service talk to this team.  They helped me upgrade my phone and helped every step of the way to ensure everything was transferred. We hit a few issues but they worked out how to do it, nothing was too much. Thank you for the time, effort and customer service to make me smile and recommend O2 to my friends.",2
"Today my sister and I went into our local Wrexham store. These shops can sometimes feel a little intimidating, especially if you are a technophobe.We had a lovely salesman to serve us though and he was very patient and understanding. He took him time to set up everything and explained everything that we needed to know. He was absolutely brilliant. Many thanks Anthony at Wrexham 02 store.Perhaps Anthony could give some sales tips to his colleague however who we could hear being a little passive aggressive in his sales approach.",2
Stephen van Rooyen my South African hero !!!Stephen helped me with my query and resolved the issue with speed and confidence.Spoke to me the whole time and was very professional.A credit to o2Thank you so much.,2
"I cancelled voicemail with O2  many months ago , now it is back on my phone . Unable to contact customer service at o2 , as at least 30 minute wait , also no chat on line .

Stephen Rooyen provided me with an outstanding excellent service,2
"I had a wonderful experience on Wednesday 16th of June 2021 during a phone call to O2 Customer Service.The call was with Pamela and I made the call at 09:11 am regarding a mobile for one of my O2 contracts (I have three).Pamela was absolutely wonderful. She was very knowledgeable, assertive, truly helpful and kind. She was patient and creative in finding ways to help me with my problem. I was quite anxious and her calm manner helped put me at ease and she managed to resolve my problem. I'm so grateful.Thank you very much to Pamela, absolute star!",2
"I called Customer Services after coming up against some difficulties applying a discount I’d been promised, online. I spoke to Stephen Van Rooyen, based in Cape Town, and wow, what a service. He spent time figuring out how to resolve the issue, was considerate, attentive and kept me informed throughout. He even called me back two days later with an update. He showed integrity, he was really friendly and we chatted for more than he is probably allowed but he was so bloody lovely, I didn’t want to let him go! Thanks for an incredible service and for resolving my issue, it’s much appreciated.",2
Really enjoyed our trip up the O2 this afternoon. One off the bucket list. Thank you Jacob.,2
"Amazing customer service. They changed my number immediately and explained to me, to understand, my issue with the contract. Thank you very much 5 🌟",2
"I recently had a fraud order made on my O2 account, where fraudsters had tried to order new iPhone. As soon as I realised I got straight in touch with O2’s customer support who where really helpful in resolving the issue for me, so that I wouldn’t be liable for the cost of the phone or the contract. I can’t rate their customer support service highly enough!",2
"Well I’ve just been to the 02 phone shop in Northwick, I can honestly say the staff and service was fantastic. I would definitely go there again. A big thank you for all your help.Melvin",2
"Went in today to query a few things, left with a new phone and a cheaper contract as it turned out that due to the phone I wanted, there was a way for me to trade in my old one, pay off my term early and have a large upfront payment, was very happy. Every time I have gone into the high wycombe store the staff have always been accommodating and helpful, so much so my partners even switching to O2 as he's so impressed by how I'm treated, even after being with them for so long.",2

"I would like to send a BIG Thank you to James the manager and James the assistant manager at the O2 store in Middleton Manchester. They relentlessly tried to solve the problem of my phone, which was lost in transit from the repair centre for an hour and a half. I am extremely grateful for their support and commitment in solving this problem. O2 are lucky to have such supportive staff. Thank you to you both 😊",2
Brilliant help from Stephen. He was able to explain causes of my phone problems and was a fountain of information. He was very pleasant and made sure I was happy with the help and info he gave me.  Highly recommended.,2
Stephen my advisor was most helpful in dealing with an ongoing query over the past 3-4 weeks which sadly hadn’t been resolved & completed by other members of staff to my frustration. He was well spoken & polite throughout our conversation & kept me informed of the process throughout.,2
"Sean and the team here in O2 Macclesfield have been outstanding. The device I wanted wasn’t available in store however went the extra mile to have it couriered the following morning.They found the right package for my excessive use. Store was impeccable in standards,PPE was worn by the whole team whom looked immaculate. Have been a customer of O2 for over 30 years in this day & age it’s challenging to find excellent customer care especially as the e-commerce is a popular destination for the masses.Thanks guys see you shortly",2
"WOW I can't believe  the bad experience some have had! It's usually the the usual suspects, haven't got a good word for anybody anything! Find fault......02 are or have been  with me BEAUTIFUL,  I've been with Vodafone, ee,  they  need to keep on taking them.All others pigy back there networks.02 so sweet!!!@@ play nice.",2
Brilliant customer service. I’ve been with o2 as my phone provider for around 15 years and they’ve always been great.I placed an order through today for an upgrade and spoke to two advisors who were both amazing and very friendly.I had an issue with the first order and called back and was helped by Lee who was superb. He went the extra mile to guide me through the process and to rectify the problem.Both calls were answered almost immediately after getting through the options and my queries were answered quickly by very friendly advisors.,2
Best customer service ever. Arun was very helpful very patient with all my questions.,2
Today I've called O2 and I'm so pleased and amazed how quick and easy the help was aragend for me.Unfortunately I forgot lady name..Ruben I think It was or Robyn.I would like to thank you for sending me the information so quickly.,2
"I received a call from Harry M, said he was a week new at the company and clearly knew his stuff. I upgraded my phone and am very happy with the deal.",2
"I don't understand all the bad reviews on here.Moved back to o2 at the beginning of last year. Hassle free porting number and setting it all up. Since then, I have a great signal and 4g.Last month I visited a store to purchase a smart watch. Again, hassle free and the service I recieved was amazing.",2
"Went into Macclesfield Store today to see about upgrading iPhone. Great advice from Tom with different options, prices and advice looking forward to the future. No pressure selling, very comfortable and as always will go back into that store as have used them for at least the last 10 years. Staff have always been very helpful in there.",2
"Timely professional help. I had the sad task of closing my Dad’s mobile phone account, with O2 (loss of capacity due to severe head injury). The chain of live phone communication and 2-3 straight forward emails, between us, with their want and willingness to help (from one human being to another) made it a caring and effortless experience. Thank you so much.",2
"Recently upgraded my Samsung phone with o2 at the Hedge End Southampton Shop in Next store. Terrific assistance from both the staff members in helping with my choice, this followed by excellent service in setting up my new phone and transferring all data from my old phone.I have been an o2 customer for more years than I can remember, only ever had a couple of queries, which were dealt with efficiently.Well done.",2
"Been with O2 for a few years and the team in store have always been friendly and helpful for all issues I have been in for. Sometimes getting the team members getting in touch with customer services can result in a wait, but having that face to face reassurance and pointers on how to get additional use out of my devices has been great for me",2
Jack Magee absolutely brilliant after being messed around for half an hour and kicked from the previous call this man is brilliant thank you jack all the best,2
I am O2 customer for many years but few times I was tempted to check other providers and will definitely stay with O2 only. If anyone complains about O2 services or customer advisors I strongly recommend to check others to see how bad it can be as you clearly have no idea.I actually don’t have to contact customer service often because everything is working with no problem. If there is anything I’m not happy about it is always resolved quickly and professionally (even during COVID). My upgrades are also always smooth process with great offers. Customer advisors every time are helpful and professional so I can’t remember I had to call twice for the same thing. If any follow up was needed they were contacting me.Not a cheapest network - fact - but at least you know what you are paying for. Years of hassle free use are worth it.,2
"Had a great experience chatting with Jane Howard (I hope that's her name) and setting up my phone upgrade last week.  I really felt like she had the time to talk me through the process and also make a personal connection.  Being in the wellbeing industry I am all about connections, which is the most important of the five ways to wellbeing (as defined by New Economics Foundation).  Thanks for taking the time for asking a bit about me and making me laugh.",2
BEST COVERAGE ABOUT!!! EVEN WITH GIFFGAFF,2
"I recently spoke to an O2 advisor (David) earlier this afternoon. However, I would like to write a positive review (to be passed to O2 management/customer service), as I felt highly satisfied with the phone call - as though I was talking to a friend/relative. This is because David made me feel comfortable, happy, relaxed whilst talking to him throughout the phone call. Besides talking about any queries I had with my contract & being able to resolve them quickly & effectively, I also had a personal conversation with David about “everyday chitchat”. If I had to sum up David; he’s warm, polite, friendly, courteous, helpful, charismatic, assertive, supportive & (if given the chance), would definitely love to talk to David again, in the future. Also, for any customers who have possibly taken out a contract/had problems with a different phone company - I would highly recommend O2 (I will be staying with O2 when my contract expires).",2
Absolutely fantastic company. No problems at all.,2
"Spoke to a very helpful colleague today named @John. I had trouble trying to take out a new contract for over one week and this guy helped me and was extremely patient. He explained everything and answered all my questions! He was on the phone with me for 1hr 30mins and not once rushed the call, instead he sorted out the issue and helped me take out a new contract. He was such a lovely gentleman and genuinely did everything he could to help me! I’ve spoken to many colleagues from o2 over 3 years of being with them and not once have I ever experienced bad customer service. I can’t thank John enough and the o2 team; every time I have rang for anything they have been extremely helpful! The network has been amazing and I cannot recommend them enough! Excellent service 👍🏼 Well done and thank you again 🙌🏼",2
"From roqueHer name is Amy from o2 customer service went extra mile to solve my issue as i  wanted a help to keep my old number , i tried on o2 app , it was asking me for 2 character which i had no idea about it so she sorted my issues about the problem without any hesitation.Keep it up. Excellent.",2
"Really surprised by the low rating here. I just used their online chat to resolve a problem with text messages. My bank was trying to send me a temporary password that I was not receiving.  I open the chat on their site, and they solved my problem in less than 10 minutes.  Never really interact with O2 otherwise but on this first interaction they were brilliant!",2
O2 your the best .Lovely customer service although expensive I still value you .Thank you for looking after me and being understanding I’ll be with you forever .Always the best service and a lovely customer service thanks again .I’m truly loyal ….Thank youZara,2
Ordered an Apple Watch from O2 the order was placed and arrived the next dayEasy to use website and easy to find what I needed including tariffWell done O2,2
OMG thank you soooo much o2. Sending me an alert on a text message while I’m on the phone to whom I thought was 02 ( fraudster) just about to tell them the code. This is the best thing any company has done. I feel like you literally pulled me out the wrong door. I’m so grateful THANKYOUStrongly defiantly recommend o2,2
"I was in a real fix communication-wise and ill and a friend sent me an O2 sim card via you-know-who. The instructions were straightforward and my phone adjusted after restarting. I didn't need to reload Whatsapp etc. I am really grateful for the easy transition. Yesterday, I noticed the same sim card in my local supermarket, so next time I'm in a fix, I'll know what to do for £10.",2
I spoke to Kim at 02 today and she was very polite and helpful! Definitely the best service I’ve got so far from o2!,2
I phoned 202 and nicola answered.( I think thats her name) She has amazing customer service. I'm not lying. I asked 50 questions and she was patient the whole way. She needs a promotion definitely. Changing sim was extremely simple gave me a great deal and don't have to do anything extra no ordering a new sim.,2
"I been an O2 customers for 4 years. I am honestly surprised about the bad customer service reviews. Whenever I had to phone them I was always able to solve my issue in less than 5 minutes, friendly, professional and straightforward customer service. My coverage was always great in London. The only reason why I am leaving  after 4 years because I found a better deal. Other than that I highly recommend it.",2
"I just spoke to someone called Kyle. He was informative, clear, knowledgable and to be honest, seemed like a proper top bloke. I’ve been with O2 for years so I know what to expect and how the process works when I upgrade my phone. After having concerns with completing the form on the app, Kyle took me through it step by step. It didn’t feel patronising or ‘salesy’, it was a really comfortable and pleasant experience. I felt completely at ease with the whole process and this is because of Kyle. I have never written a good review for someone before as I haven’t ever received such a good service that I felt I needed to commend someone. A true credit to O2, if someone can please ensure his line manager is informed that would be greatly appreciated.Also, I’ve been with O2 for years and have found them to be helpful if there is an issue. My most recent phone had a problem with it and they arranged a replacement without any hassle. I’ve also entered into their competitions on O2 priority and won many prizes - although I enter daily!Thank you, Madison",2
Just came over to O2 from BT. Porting my number went great. Free Disney Plus for six months too. So far so good.,2
"Early days but can’t be happier!Got sim only plan just 12GB for tenner so really cheap.Have Pixel 5 and getting over 200Mbps in my location (Liverpool). Since I’m working from home so pretty much on WiFi all the time 12GB is plenty!Switched from Three, they put two 5G mast in the city and claimed coverage. O2 has like 50% covered!Love it.",2
"Mohammad was extremely helpful, very nice and understanding of my situation and was very clear throughout, very pleased with my service today",2
I’m a new customer to o2 I joined on 18th January on a sim only from Vodafone my number was ported to o2 on the 19th without a problem. Ive done some speed tests and its way better than Vodafone I’m getting 175:20 Mb/s download and 8.60 Mb/s upload in my area NG19 which is a 5g area. Not tried calling customer service so can’t comment on that.,2
The best network 02 for best coverage with strong signal and customer services  are excellent  sorting out my problems. 02 have more masts than any other networks in UK. I joined 02 on 12.01.2021from Three Network.,2
"Reliable company, been with them for many years.",2
"I have been with O2 for 4 years, always had great customer service and great upgrades plans 👌🏻",2
"Dave, has been absolutely helpful and understanding during this pandemic he’s great at doing his job even though Ive annoyed him  please recognise his carisma and his hard work!",2
"customer service resolved and very empathetic, was a poor review but they turned it around",2
I went into the Macclesfield 02 shop yesterday to buy a new iPhone. I was served by Tom who was extremely helpful and proactive.,2

Thanks Tom for all your help you were so helpful and had me sorted with a new phone in no time. Excellent first class service.,2
"Hi thanks for the most amazing service I have ever received, Ben was super helpful and went out of his way to help me, I was in a dilemma where I was paying too much every month, he was so empathetic and honest and did his very best to see what he can do for me! He managed to get me a cheaper deal and I am now a customer for life! Can’t thank him enough! He deserves a pay rise !! Deserves a bonus!Ben taylor concentrixs team.Needs a promotion!",2
One of the best networks in UK. Good enough to go,2
I can only give 5 stars to a certain customer support agent Jack Edwards from the Dearne Valley call centre in Rotherham. He was absolutely brilliant and sorted out our problem. We cannot thank him enough. Previously we made numerous phone calls all ending in either being cut off or saying they could not help giving 1 star service. We then went to a shop and they could not help either. So a massive thank you to Jack Edwards in the Dearne Valley call centre for giving us a little faith in 02. Very much appreciated.,2
"Just a quick review to say thank you to Tracy T (complaints) who resolved my issue in a single afternoon.Always refreshing for such a speedy resolution and got me back a hefty £224 that had been taken in error.Thanks again,Emily",2
"I spoke to Gerry today who was really lovely, chatty, and thorough. Was planning on leaving O2 but was convinced to stay as he was really helpful in finding a plan that suited me. Related to me as a customer, and ensured i had all of the information I needed to feel comfortable moving forward. Thanks Gerry!",2
O2 suggested that i should purchase an ipad for my studies and i can honestly say this has been the best purchased i've ever made. its like they knew what i needed and what was the perfect fit for me. thank you O2!!,2
"Amazing and understanding customer service, rang as struggling financially. So sympathetic and willing to help. Plus 02Have fantastic referral service for customer who have difficulties in interacting in making calls etc. I simply can not fault how brilliant the service was. Thank you 02",2
"I can't believe how many negative reviews there are about this company - have they been dealing with the same provider that I have?I've been an o2 customer since I was about 13 years old (I'm now 25), and I've never had any problems with them.I've been due an upgrade since March 2020, but I couldn't be bothered to visit my local branch, so just decided to upgrade on the My o2 app. I'd never done this before, but it was actually SO simple. I ordered my new phone at 9PM yesterday and unbelievably it arrived within 12 hours - how good is that?Also, just wanted to say that the 'My o2' app is really useful and easy to use!",2
"I recently switched from Vodafone. It wasn't bad, but they couldn't deliver a basic decent 4G speed for 3 years. Also, never listened to the feedback. Launching a 5G network with big hoo-ha without stabilising the local 4G networks is a bad business strategy.So, I switched to O2. My personal experience is good so far. I have now decent speed, and the customer service knows what they are doing. I made them thinking hard, trust me. :))) I like the O2 app as well, it's clear and simple and straight forward and not like Vodafone, O2 don't try to push down all the irrelevant offers in my throat. I can manage better my account as well, it's just working well as expected. They have decent automated messaging service in place, so whenever I made some changes compared to the other providers I got more reassurance at O2 about what is going on, then the others (Vodafone and EE).",2
After dreadful customer service from Carphone Warehouse I chose to trade in my phone at 02 at the Gyle store in Edinburgh. First class customer service and took around 10minutes max to sort. Difference between the 2 is night and day.,2
"I have tried and moved to many other mobile network providers over the years. I now always buy my own mobile phone and get a 12 month sim only deal 40GB data, unlimited minutes & unlimited texts for £8 per month. I always setup a spend cap, premium rate bars and limits on my account to stop any nasty surprises on my monthly bill. It would be fantastic if bars could be turned on or off in the My O2 app please. Thank you.",2
"Hi, today i just had a remarkable experience on the phone with one of the employees of your Payment Management department, his name is Colin. He was very professional, patient, kind and he explains with knowledge and a very nice voice to listen to all the details about my case. I was very impressed and I would like to congratulate him and your company on his outstanding customer service special in these days.",2
Best phone company on the market by far 👌👌👌👌👌,2
"Needed to order a new micro sim, 02 sorted it out straight away and I was back up a running in no time! Thanks Amanda Lawrence for all your help",2
"The O2 store at Morfa, Swansea went the whole 9 yards to ensure that a new mobile phone was set up perfectly. It was not an easy set and took place over a few days, some issues arose that needed a coordinated effort within O2.Could not be happier with the level of customer service and effort.",2
Sanna is a star! The most helpful customer service consultant. I had an issue to activate my business account and manage to fix it. Also explained to me why my data usage was so high although I haven't used it.I'm very happy of how helpful sanna was to me.Thanks sanna🤞,2
I just wanted to leave a fantastic review for an absolute star who has been helping me. Christopher edge. He has helped every step of the way with my upgrade/switching from another network. Thank you Chris!,2
"I've been an O2 customer with multiple contracts for over 10 years and I've never had any problems with them.Service is almost perfect and when it comes to renewing and upgrading, I always find they'll provide the very best offers available.I really couldn't find fault in the service I've received.",2
Was in the Glasgow Fort O2 shop and was served by John who did an excellent job of switching all my data on my old phone over to the new handset.   I had a bad experience of O2 in Braehead where the guy who was serving me basically told me to go home and google this and watch a U tube video.   Needless to say I left the shop without changing my contract.   I cannot praise John at the Glasgow Fort enough.,2
WowTook advantage of Black Friday 2020 deal.  Not only saved 17% on phone but delivery was amazing with no charge!!!Ordered 7:30pm Sunday arrived 9:30 am Monday,2
"Great service, Great company.Enough said",2
"Rang O2 today to get some help with switching my tariff for a payg sim as I am in need of waaaay more data and I was running out. Although my request was a bit difficult as I have already changed it once this week, they still found a way to do it at no extra cost. I would like to say thanks to Jaamine and her manager for being absolute superstars! Thanks again!",2
"Very good coverage. Very good customer service, exceptional price.",2
I saw Ryan on the 4th November to change my sons tariff in Stirling Scotland branch.Ryan was helpful and patient and had a friendly and supportive manner.I will definitely be returning to that branch when I’m due and upgrade. Thank you!,2
If you want great customer service I highly recommend Jacob he has been really helpful with our transactions. A really lovely guy to speak through everything with and went above and beyond.,2
"This review is for Paul at the Coventry 02 store.In brief after my Dad purchased a new phone, he had numerous issues with it and was getting charged daily for services he wasn’t using. After several frustrating calls to customer service and lots of different advise that got us nowhere and practically made the phone unusable.We went back to the store, Paul sorted the phone out, suggested a better tariff for Dads needs and reset everything for him.Dad was so grateful for his professionalism and time, asked me to put a review on in the hope he receives the recognition deserved.",2
"I honestly don’t see all the hate for 02. Never had a problem with them. Straight to the point when setting up the contracts without them sneaky little add ones. Just people need to aswell ask, reads, double and triple check before signing them. Good service and got good deals from them",2
"I am so shocked with O2's rating here.  It doesn't make sense!  I've been with them since they were BT, before it became BT Cellnet, before Cellnet and then O2.Over the many years with this company I have seen it develop a lot but the things that always keeps me with them are their customer service, their fairness and their reliability.So, how the hekk in hell are O2 only getting an average rating of less than 2*s?  I can only envisage two reasons for this.  The 1st is that many of the reviews are not from O2's customers.  I just can't believe so many genuine customers would think so lowly of them.  The other reason is that those rating O2 so lowly have never experienced the customer service of the other network providers.  EE already had terrible service and now they are now owned by BT I can just imagine how much further they will go to prove they are the worst.All people I know, except one, is on O2 and all have exactly the same experience as me.  If they have a problem, they call O2 and the call is ansered within seconds, not days like other companies.  Additionally, when you get to speak to somebody at O2, that person takes ""responsibility"" for your query, issue, complaint etc. and that person stays with you until all is resolved.  With other networks, it can take days of trying to get through as even when a call is answered it's only so they can put you on hold for as long as it takes before you lose patience and hang up.  When you do finally get through to sopmebody they either put you on hold until you go away or they pass you through to somebody else, who passes you to somebody else etc. etc. until you give up going around in circles with nobody taking responsibility for your query.So, with my decades of experience with O2, I really wish I could score them 5,000* so I can wipe out the fake and the unfair revues and leave enough to outweigh future fake and unfair reviews for quite some time.Sadly, I can't score more than the 5* so that is what I have given.  I highly recommend O2 and have done so for many years and not a single person that I have encouraged to switch to O2 has had any regret.",2
"The service that I have received from 02 in Kensington High Street has always been very good and professional. But yesterday I collected my new I-phone 12 Pro from Mr Rohan Ramaiya at 10AM and he simply couldnt have been more helpful, patient and incredibly efficient. He went out of his way to ensure that I got the tarrif and all the various accessories that I needed without pushing me into buying unecessary items. He was absolutely first class in every respect.This is a store that I can really recommend for all one's mobile phone needs. Thank you all for being such a great team.",2
"I ordered an iPhone 12 from O2 which I have just received.  A faultless 5-star experience.  The experience was similar when I ordered my wife's phone a few weeks ago.By comparison, I first started this journey by unsuccessfully trying to order from Three - I have left a review (via TP) regarding this experience which I begrudgingly gave a 1-star.Well done O2",2
"I would like to thank Rachel after my visit this morning. With patience, understanding and good humour, she assessed the various problems , untangled the chaos and handed me back a perfectly working phone.What an asset she is to the store, And I love the colour of her hair!!!!!!!",2
Great service all through lockdown.  Thankyou.  Also great competitions on O2 priority and thankyou for the free coffees much appreciated.,2
Been with O2 since 2010. Never had a problem. Good value and I like the way my phone agreement is separate from my airtime,2
02 are absolutely brilliant best network to be on upgraded my wife from sim plan to device plan when the device arrived it was damaged I rang o2 no problem they arranged for new device to be delivered next day to swap for damaged one excellent service 10 /10,2
"Many thanks to Rachel at the Bury O2 shop who helped me swop my SIM last Thursday.  A simple task for most people but for a ""senior citizen"" somewhat daunting.  She also took steps to enable me to keep my number.  Thanks again, Rachel!",2
"I have been very pleased with my service from the 02 shop in  Worthing, Tooting and Wandsworth.   BUT a cowboy in the 02 shop in Clapham Junction lost me 80 contacts and only managed to transfer 6.!!",2
"I've been with O2 for almost 9 years as a ""pay as you go"" customer and I'm really happy with their service. Their prices have always been very competitive, they have some fantastic offers (they only send me a text about them once in a while, no hassle at all), they also have a great rewards program, and their signal is very strong too (when I'm in some remote place, I often have better connection than my friends who have different mobile providers). I can totally recommend them.",2
Brilliant service all data rolls over verry nice customer service yeah just good service tbh.,2
"Mr Layke of Manchester and Ms Lisa Ray of South Africa office overseas thank you both for being very helpful and informative.O2 has a very good reception.Moreover; the Customer services are Polite, Professional, and Posh.I have been with O2 almost for 8 years by now, and also moved my existing number to O2 recently.",2
Fantastic customer service from Lindsay dealing with a fairly complex Phone issue. Very professional and restored our faith in O2.,2
"I have been wanting to upgrade my phone for a while. Customer services were calling while I was at work. I have finally managed to call in and get sorted. I spoke with a lovely lady, Holly (in Sheffield) who was super helpful, bubbly and definitely deserves recognition for her wonderful service today! Thanks Holly!",2
Just want to say a massive thank you to Anna on the upgrades team. She’s been an absolute star! After being with o2 for so many years and being passed around whole day trying to sort out my upgrade. She’s gone above and beyond for me and she truly deserves to be recognised for this. So thank you so much Anna!!,2
Online chat 30/08/2020Excellent service. Didnt have to queue and listen to music. Just type my question and away it went.   I messed up the password so Nikhil sent a code instead. I wanted to change my payment date which was done efficiently and within a few mins. Nikhil was polite and charming. This isnt the 1st time ive been on online chat. I do recommend it.,2
"I recently bought a sim card for a dongle for use on a laptop by a friend who was in hospital. I had problems trying to monitor the usage (so I could top it up) so called o2 Customer Services for advice. The first advisor I spoke to was not all synpathetic or helpful as no matter how many times I told him that the person using the card did not have a mobile phone, he continued to tell me to advise him to register with o2 so they could send him a a text with a code...so in total frustration I decided to call again and was connected to a different adviser called Charlotte. I made it clear that I was very close to tears and might either scream or cry.... she remained calm and listened to what I was telling her very carefully - and straight away was able to get to the bottom of the problem. She advised me that I had purchased the wrong kind of sim needed for use on a laptop and advised me that after a while it would stop working. Rather than making me feel stupid she simply asked for the adress where she could send a replacement sim which I gave her. The very next day the sim card arrived at my friends parents house and they were able to take it to the hospital for him to use. Not only that but she preloaded the card with credit to replace the credit that I had put on th eoriginal sim card....  this was a just a really fantastic happy end to a frustrating situation in which everyone involved was already under a lot of stress. Charlotte seemed to understand not just thge technical issue that needed reolving - but also had great empathy regarding the dilemma I was in. My faith in customer services was renewed - if only everyone could be trained by Charlotte! She made my day - I just wish I could send her some chocolates or flowers .",2
"Amazing service at the Eastleigh Swan Centre store. I was helped by a lovely lady yesterday who was helpful, polite and a pleasure to talk to really. I had walked in to talk about iPhone upgrades and walked out with a new iPad! Just goes to show how good she is at her job really, though I never felt pressured to buy and believe I walked out with a really great deal. Credit where credit is due and this woman deserves praise. If only I could deal with her every time I went to O2!",2
I recently had a phone call with one of the O2 representatives because I was paying a £40 monthly bill and my contract was coming to an end. I wanted to switch to a pay monthly contract and the lady on the phone was lovely and so helpful and got me on a £10 a month contract with everything I needed (and I got disney+ for free via O2!!) Thank you for making switching super easy!,2
"I am having financial issues due to COVID, unable to pay my costly bill. Julie from Payment management was able to rearrange everything for me and even helped me sort things out. I really appreciate her, she is an asset to O2.",2
Sat in store at the moment making an insurance claims staff have been extremely helpfull,2
O2 the best network in UK I’m customer with them over 9 years I never have any problem .,2
Been with o2 for years and see no reason for leaving. Reasonably priced for a great service.,2
"Been with for many years, no problem to report, guess I must be one of the lucky ones!",2
"called customer services as was having issues with a code i was sent for my upgrade. Spoke to a lovely lady called Eleanor who dealt with my issue and helped to find me the best quote! Left the call happy with the service she has provided and with a new upgrade on the way!I have spoken to some vile customer service people, I just wish a lot more of them had the patience and people skills as Eleanor and that way O2 would have a lot more happy customers!Thanks again and fingers crossed for Spain x",2
"So far not had a problem with O2, network coverage for me is excellent and at a decent price.I have had some poor network providers before (namely Virgin mobile and most recently EE) and so far O2 has been head and shoulders above them.Hopefully this will continue.",2
"I’ve been with Three for years, but sadly since the world Crisis Three has been shocking, switching and using O2 has been fab ( so far ) and the bonus of AppleTV+ and Disney+ was cool also!I’m hoping that the so far excellent service continues...",2
"Signed up for o2 over the weekend, received an email saying I needed to call in to confirm my order. Called and Instantly got put through to an advisor who was very friendly and helpful. Early days yet but I'm impressed by the level of service so far",2
Matthew from Burnley was really helpful on the phone. After being rejected twice and I re-applied and I was accepted for the Samsung Tablet TAB A 10.1. He explained things perfectly and went out of his way to assist me further. Absolutely polite on the phone and excellent customer services skills :),2
Always been happy as a customer with 02. They seem to give me a really good deal. Customer service team is pleasant. Thank you :-),2
I went to the 02 shop in Redcar ( teesside) Tommy was very polite and dealt with my enquiry without any chew. I left there very pleased nothing was a problem.,2
I would like to thank the staff at the Truro store (especially Luke) for all the help given to me yesterday in a difficult environment.Peter Jennings,2
"Just had a really positive experience with John from O2 technical support.  He was personable, supportive and went out of his way to help me. Gave me really good advice and resolved a sim issue.",2
Fabulous company and service provided.  Highly recommend.,2
"I am taking five minutes out of my day to thank O2 representative James Lohan for the courtesy and helpfulness he extended to me recently.Faced with a situation that I was unsure how to proceed with, James Lohan helped me through the process with a perfectly pleasant and professional manner.What I thought was going to be a somewhat difficult experience was made so much easier by this young man. No question was too absurd and never once was I left feeling overwhelmed with jargon I didn't understand.He has restored my faith in customer services and ensured that 02 has secured my business for the foreseeable future.Thank you againJames Lohan O2 Customer Services.19/05/20 13:18CASE ID :1199273032",2
I am an O2 customer for over 4 years i can say that i am happy with their service. I never had any reception problem like i had with Three. Just renewed my contract i toked  the samsung a90 5g for 30 months with 30 GB  and insurance for £53 a month,2
"My mum ordered a contract phone, was to be delivered today, she didn't realise she had signed up for a ""cashback"" phone, this meant the contract had risen from £23 to £37 per month, my mum wasn't understanding of this, and even though the fault was hers, we called 02 and spoke to AJ, he sorted the whole mess out for her and she now has a new phone at the price she wanted, big up to 02, massive up to AJ, and one happy oap 😊",2
"I've never had a problem with o2. I've been with them since I was 15 and I'm now 32. I moved to may monthly after being on pay as you go since I joined them. I get unlimited calls, texts and 100GD of data for £20 p/m. I've never had issues with my connection, signal quality or with the staff. Generally, I refuse to go with anyone else as I've been with Vodafone and Virgin before and they are terrible.",2
"Ordered a new sim only deal - came the next working day.Filled in online form with PAC code details - number ported within 24hrs.All up and running. As yet, no problems.",2
I always end up back with 02.  From the shops to customer service and ease of use much better than Tesco mobile anyway.,2
I told O2 I may have had Covid_19 but I was looking after my family and out of work due to the Coronavirus. They offered to put a hold on my account and leave my phone on so I could keep in touch with my family. I thought that was an amazing thing for them to do in already difficult times. I have been with O2 for a very long time (since bt cellnet) and don't see that changing any time soon. Thank you O2. I did end up paying but the offer was still good.,2
During a time like this in COVID-19 I wasn't expecting to be served at all or anyone to answer. After getting through the automated service I was put through to Adam who's service was perfect! I wanted an upgrade and wasn't sure on the best deal but Adam talked me through them all and made it clear to what I would be paying for and for how long as well as going through what works for me data wise and airtime. I've been with O2 for over 5 years and always gone through Carphone Warehouse and never really had thorough service like that so was very impressed with O2. I am now looking forward to my contract and upgrade as I'm fully aware of what I'm paying for as Adam dealt with everything and explained it to a T.,2
"I had a problem with my o2 pay as you go an am living abroad in oz. I normally have a contract in uk. I tried a few times to get through but due to covid had no luck so sent in an email to complaints an an o2 emplyee called Rachel was extremely helpful and answered my email, requested more info and then sorted my sim problem out. I am delighted with the customer service i received from o2 today. I have been with o2 for years and will continue.",2
"The longest I've spent with any network. They've been more than happy to renew me onto contracts priced even better than new customer deals when I've phoned up each year, and O2 Priority actually has some great benefits (that I didn't think I'd make any use of originally).",2
O2 /telefonica ukAfter upgrading my phone and taking out one of the o2 promotional deals with o2 buisness i never recived my Samsung watches (the promotion was free watches)after nearly 100days (was suppost to be delivered in 45days) i contacted samsung and the courier (fedex) myself without any luck.So i contacted the head office of o2/telefonica uk after just 3 days (including a weekend) problem solved could not have asked for a better response time or resolution.I am supprised to see so many bad reviews after the perfect and quick response i got.ThankyouMore than appreciated as this was a serious head ache for me,2
Love o2 all issues are solved and data is fast and great signal sometimes low in village area but overall really satisfied with the service way better than Vodafone or EE always quick and easy to resolve problems,2
"I am not a person who likes to leave reviews but today I have too.I was trying to upgrade my phone online but the website wasn’t allowing me to finish my order, so I decided to call o2, although the o2 msg said I would wait longer than usual, I was answered quite quickly, I got a very helpfull advicer I hope I got her name right Shuana, she was very patient, kind, and very sympathetic person, all I wanted was to finish my upgrade over the phone I wasn’t expected I could get any discount, but she volunteered to find something better for me, so she manage take £260 from my mobile phone device, I am so happy with my deal.I really can’t thank her enough, thank you Shuana.",2
Complaint about my bill dealt with within less than 24 hours. Really couldn't get better than that especially in time of COVID crisis.Absolutely fabulous,2
Great network. Always have coverage and had no problems at all whilst being with them.,2
I am a new customer2 weeks ago I got a new phone with o2 due to not having a credit history I had to pay a deposit of £425.00 which I did. One week later the county got turned on its head Covid 19 hit due to the issues with work and money I rang and asked if the £425 could be refunded without the loss of my service I seen that 02 supported my request and refunded this to my account outstanding service and support plus understanding thank you 02.,2
"I’m on pay as you go, received a text today giving me 300 free minutes to stay in touch with others during this tough time, I love this. It’s lovely to think they’re helping people who may be less fortunate and can’t talk to friends/family members through what’s going on. No other phone company I know of has done this",2
"I have had an O2 contract for two years,not once have I had a insufficient service.Good signal coverage, good response from customer service and the app works well to.My only gripe is hard sale that I got when I asked for a pac code.My contract was expiring and I found a better deal for the phone and package I required.That was the only reason for switching operators.",2
"Had a problem with handset purchased through third party. Wasn't O2's responsibility to resolve bit after the retailer refused to help they replaced the handset FOC and arranged delivery within 48 hours. Amazing service. Aisha was so understanding, only been with O2 for 3 months and felt like a valued customer.Please let Aisha know how pleased we were. Call was around 5:30 on Wednesday 24th March.",2
"Amazing service all round, thank you",2
Really good pay as you go service and really friendly,2
"Went to the O2 Huntingdon store and James the store leader helped us and I could not fault one thing! He was amazing!!!! After and awful experience with Carphone Warehouse, James made us feel at ease and helped us with every step he could. He is a true credit to O2 and when my phone contract expires I will be switching to O2!Amazing service!!",2
"I spoke to three agents today about cancelling my contract: Siliziwu, Nathan and Tracy. Siliziwu was pleasant to speak to and handled my query quickly and efficiently. Nathan was a star and really helped me know all options I had available during a really stressful and sticky situation and I really appreciated that help from him ; I wish our call wasn't disconnected. Tracy was so friendly and reassured me that everything was being actions etc. All three agents were brilliant and I'm so pleased with the service they provided.",2
"Never had one problem with there customer service, even when I've been really late paying my bill. Always very helpful",2
Fantastic data speeds and good package prices. Never had any calls drop out. Has UK call centres with staff that have a lot of knowledge about how to resolve problems. Comes with WiFi and 4G calling on sim only aswell.  No problems with O2.Worth the slightly higher price than Three as you can actually use the data you pay for.,2
"Good company, focus is the customer, reception is always good. Not cheap but fine, you get what you pay for.",2
"I have recently visited the O2 store in Southampton West Quay. As soon as I walked in it felt a good vibe and the staff all Friendly. I would like to give a shout out to Steve the advisor that helped me with a new contract and sim plan. He listened to everything I was saying and what I wanted from the plans and came up with a brilliant deal.In the past I had not had great experiences with the staff in the O2 stores even though I have been a customer for many years, however I would like to congratulate the Southampton store for restoring my faith in the company.Thank you again to Steve I will be recommending this store 😁",2
I was with O2 back than when they were called BT cellnet back in the day and EE was t mobile and one 2 one network .....But they offered me the best at the time ...now fast forward 20 years later and they are still here and improving as time goes by ...I think there customer service has been good to me so far plus they offered me the best Sim with alot of data for my money....Although at times they network does suffer from network loss but that's with all these networks nowadays depending on were Ur based....,2
I’ve spoke to a few 02 agents previously and liz was one of the most helpful along with another agent and they definitely exceeded in customer service. I thank them both for there help this morning.,2
"I wanted to personally thank Elorm in the O2 shop at 351 Oxford Street in London .Seamlessly assisted me in upgrading 2 Iphones  and the purchase of an apple watch.There was a discrepancy in the address on file which he painstakingly took charge of and rectified. Made the whole experience memorable and enjoyable . Also gave perfect advice and top quality customer service.A true professional in every sense.Carry on the great work Elorm .Kindest regards , Paul.",2
"I have smashed my phone, and after reading some reviews I was in doubts if they would help me, but no. I called and after 15 minutes talk everything was sorted and the very next day I have received the new phone trough DPD, and the smashed phone picked up. Phone insurance is not a waste of money after all.",2
I had an issue trying to upload a photo I had taken with my O2 iPhone (the file size was too large). I contacted the O2 helpline and Shadsha told me how to compress the file. Really good customer care. Many thanks.,2
"Been a customer for 15 years! I had my fair share of issues during that time as to be expected, but to be fair they always come through. Tried going off to the cheaper networks a few times but always came back promptly as none of the others are as well balanced. I get a largely hasslefree mobile life with O2 and that is all I want. I have found the best experience of O2 is to buy direct as whenever I got the 3rd party dealers involved, I always got cheated somehow - and I always but direct from one of their stores - the staff are usually great and the guru service if brilliant for any problems I have faced. Merry Christmas O2!",2
I was spoke with Daniel Davids 1995.very nice polite and funny Guy. explain me all i want 2 know.5☆,2
"Had a dispute over a bill which I did not think I should pay.  Having spoken to Lauren at 02 I was delighted that the matter was fully resolved to my satisfaction.  Well done Lauren and 02, excellent customer service",2
Fantastic customer service! All staff I spoke to had a good knowledge and were able to help me! They were patient when it came to making decisions! They listened to what I wanted rather than trying to sell me something of more value! Can’t fault them at all!,2
"My contract is finished so was going to leave and get a sim deal only because of price.received pac number and decided to  ring 02 to see if they could match a good deal I saw,which they did. Sheila In customer services was very helpful and explained how to change over from one phone to another,which I already bought,Phone up and running couldn’t ask for more.",2
"I realise there are not may good reviews on here because I guess most relate to handset/contract/broadband issues but as I only used the O2 shop I am only giving a review for that.  Ordered a bluetooth speaker, which was the cheapest price on the internet, it came with free delivery, it arrived by courier the next day.  Extremely good service in my opinion.  Shame all the other departments don't get the same views.  Well done O2 shop!!",2
"Absolutely brilliant company!! The my 02 app is so easy to check your upcoming bill and offers. Very clear on what you owe and next month bill . I have been with a lot of mobile companies and been so disappointed . 02 launched the very first iPhone in Britain, first touch screen!! I got one for my Christmas from my partner . He’s been with 02 ever since. They don’t bombard you with emails and texts. Definitely check 02 !!",2
"I appreciate many people come on here to complain about the service of O2 but I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the excellent customer service I received from Joseph Ncanyawa in helping me with my account earlier this month 9/11/19.It is the first time dealing with O2, that I have felt the need to write to knowledge a member of their customer service team and that is down to Joesph.If you are lucky to speak to him...I am sure like me you will appreciate it afterwardsWell done Joseph...keep up the good work!",2
"HEATHER from Maidenhead store was absolutely brilliant !Switched from Samsung to Huawei and she completely took the strain out of it.Helpful, cool and successful. A credit to 02.Thanks again,Paul",2
"I think O2 is brilliant! I have been on O2 for quite a few years now and I have never had any problems neither with the network, neither with billing. In fact, I had a big problem to solve with my new mobile bought from ""Affordable mobiles""(never again!!!) and O2 guys at Horwich Middlebrook centre did everything and more to solve my problem. All of them! Thank you so much to all those young men who has so much patience with us older people who do not understand new technology very well. Great team, great network!Vilija",2
"Excellent customer service, Peterborough Thanks Jamie",2
Purchased new 100GB SIM contract.SIM arrived on next day.They have transferred my number from giffgaff in no time.Brilliant service so far.,2
"Surprised that O2 have such a low rating on Trust Pilot. Many years ago, I used to us O2 all the time right up until I had my first contract with Vodafone (that's a company you need to avoid like the plague) and after rubbish signal, I moved to EE. Move to a new house and my signal with EE was shocking and was in an ongoing dispute with them for months. They eventually cancelled my contract and I took out my first O2 phone contract.Fantastic signal in the area that I live. Fantastic customer service who are always on hand to help, whether that be in store or online. Great deals.But what really ripped the scales for me is that earlier in the month, they had a promotion where they pay off contracts so you can upgrade to O2 refresh. I ended up with a brand new phone, still maintaining a fantastic service and signal and can change my phone whenever I want (within reason of course).Genuinely have no complaints and I hope that I continue to have all the more reason to keep using them.",2
"i would like to give a review about the staff of the 02shop, market st branch, manchester.They are the nicest most helpful staff iv’e ever dealt with in particular Lisa. She is one of the most efficient and helpful members of staff who gives 100% to the customer, she is a delight to deal with and takes time to explain to a technophobe such as myself, the easiest way round the latest smartphone and making it so much easier for me to understand all the technical jargon. She obviously knows what she’s talking about and is so patient n helpful she is an absolute asset to the 02 company.From a very satisfied customer Mrs B",2
As I work in customer service my self I only want the professionalism which I give my self. I spoke to an Adam Taylor in Payment Management based in Warrington. The quality and assurance    I was given from this agent was amazing. He went above and beyond to help me to his best ability. I hope his team leader and manger see this as he is a asset to the company. I wish that many other o2 agents are like Adam. Thanks Adam!!,2
"Have had problems with my pay and go. I contacted O2 and they have taken the matter seriously, contacted me several times by phone and messenger and have shown an interest in solving the problem.",2
Went in Chatham o2 store on 22/09/2019 to fix an issue with my mother's Pay and Go tariff. o2 representative Mya was very friendly and approachable. She has done all in her power to help us with our issue and even called to o2 customer service for us twice. She stood for our case until the end. We are very pleased with helpful service and highly recommend to visit this store.,2
"Was on the verge of moving my business account but had the most professional, courteous, friendly and efficient call with Martin Loughnave who was so helpful I decided to stay. Hope 02 can recognise him for his professionalism.",2
"Fraud took place on my account. Called O2 who first asked me to email the fraud company and speak to them directly. O2 asked to call them back if I had any issues. Two days later after speaking with this fraudulent company ""remote games"" I called O2 and spoke to Leonie. She was a brilliant help and was able to get these charges refunded by a good will gesture. Thanks O2 and Leonie for the quick resolution.",2
The customer service is truly the best... couldn't fault it quick and accurate service... such friendly people and always find a way to help.,2
"Always had a great experience with O2, always helpful on chat and happy to assist.",2
"I ordered a phone via the my o2 app as I was due an upgrade. It was meant to be next day delivery but after 3 day of waiting and my new phone not arriving I decided to phone the o2 customer services. An agen called Shannon answered, she mentioned that that on her system it shows the phone was delivered the next day, obviously I havent recieved it so she contacted the couriers. They hadnt a clue where the phone was and had to perform a driver review. All of this happened over a couple of hours and Shannon made certain I didnt speak to another advisor which meant I didnt have to constantle explain my situation. She was so lovely and constantly apologised for this issue which is not her nor o2's fault. My phone was delivered to my neighbour but no card was posted to let me know. I now have my phone and I am very thankful for all of Shannons help.",2
"I visited the o2 store in Wood Green and would like to thank Adrian for his very honest and informative customer service. He was very polite, helpful and far from pushy (which you can often get from a sales rep). He knew his stuff, explained things clearly, was completely transparent - made my customer experience a productive one so thank you once again.",2
"Visited O2 in Livingston Almondvale shop today with my Mum and was very impressed with Fiona, who was extremely helpful and ever so patient and informative. Excellent service provided by this member of staff.",2
"Have been a costumer for a right few years. Outstanding company. Network and coverage is second to none, great customer service, Always have gone the extra mile for me. It’s nice to use a company that makes you feel like your needs come first.",2
"In honestly I like O2 and the issues that I have had were resolved quickly and with little fuss. Over the years I’ve been a customer of all of the telecommunications companies and really only 02 have been worth while using and certainly the best company too use.I’m sure like most companies nowadays, there is moments when service is bad but I haven’t experienced this from 02 yet and hopefully I won’t.I’d recommend o2 and give 9/10*Tip* If your having trouble with your phone try contacting the manufacturer as well (Apple/Samsung etc) quite often they will just replace/repair  the handset without  all the hassle.",2
"My experience with O2 so far been great. I use a pay as you go sim, and it is the international version. I can ring EU for couple of pence a minute, which is great. I can also enjoy a free hot drink from Cafe Nero on a Tuesday or Wednesday and loads of other discounts with the Priority app.  Keep up the good work, O2!",2
Couldn't do enough for me when I received my handset and were great with setting up my phone for me.,2
"Excellent service yet again. You may need to wait a little while to be served, but it's always worth it. The customer service at Eastbourne O2 is amazing. Today,  however, it was better than ever! Thank you Kyle for all your help with choosing my new phone, and with transferring everything over. You really went above and beyond, and you're a credit to O2. No pushy sales tactics, just brilliant, old fashioned good customer service.  Thank you",2
Never had a problem with 02 been with them for about 6 years and every time I have a issue with paying the bill they are always so helpful. I could not fault them.,2
I upgraded my phone recently and the staff in the UK call centre found me a great deal and were really helpful.  I picked the phone up from a store where admittedly the staff weren't that bothered unless I bought something.  They told me to go to 134 Oxford Street to see if there was a guru there who could help me get it up and running as I'm not great with new technology.  I had tried to book a guru in advance but none were available and my home internet and landline had gone down so I couldn't get help that way.  I'm having medical treatment and need to be connected to the outside world.  The staff at 134 Oxford Street were lovely and more than made up for the other store. Even though no guru was available Tenzin kindly got the phone going and showed me how to use it.  I'm delighted with my phone and am very grateful for that store's amazing customer service.  I finally managed to book a guru to learn more about how my phone works and Danny in the Brixton store was very knowledgeable.,2
"I am on o2 pay as you go. Through my own fault my sim was blocked, the call center in South Africa was very friendly and restored my sim number as well as restoring the original ballance. I live in SA do not speak Africaans but the advisor spoke perfect English. As long as you get good service it does not have to be in the UK",2
"I’ve been from o2 for approx 4 months now, after moving from awful Vodafone. So far so good. The cost is reasonable, priority benefit and customer service is good.I like the fact that I can put a bar on my account and have add-on. I also receive warnings when I’m close to using up my data and calls allowance",2
"I cannot fault o2. I asked if I could send a Huawei GT watch back that I bought 5 weeks ago due to developing an allergic reaction to something in the watch and they were more then happy to either refund me or exchange it for something else to which I choose a fitbit versa. Thankyou o2, a lot better then my previous network",2
Excellent customer service. I had some problems with extra charges on my bill and phoned to query them. The customer service advisor (sadly forgot his name) was extremely helpful.He took the time to figure out what happened. Asked me if I was ok to wait to get his manager to look at it and then he told me that they could get back the charges. He also sat and calculated the correct amount including the VAT so that I would get every penny that was taken by accident.Very polite and reassuring over the phone and even wished me a good weekend. 10/10,2
"I contacted o2 via the live chat to query an upgrade .. I have a sim only plan so just wanted to add a device plan to this. The advisors on live chat couldn’t help me in anyway! To the point where I said no bother, I will leave and go back to three. They just accepted this and I closed the chat. I called 202 just to quickly discuss if there were any options and spoke to a lovely advisor called Craig. He was wonderful and upgraded my phone with no problems at all. The 5 star review is for Craig. Don’t use live chat it’s far too robotic!!",2
"Id like to thank the welcome security guys especially John who was so kind and went out of his way to provide us with a wheelchair to get our father to our destination, it helped to make our mother and fathers anniversary a bit more special, and he did it in his own time.",2
"I have been with o2 for 20 years. I had a great experience so far. Nothing to complain about at all.The prices are fair for what I get and they don't surprise you with out of the blue big price raises when your deal expire... I tried Virgin and Vodaphone, which were ok but Virgin kept hiking the prices up + you have to deal with loads of third parties; and vodaphone had intermittent connection at the time.O2 so far so good!",2
"Great customer service at O2 Harrow store. Haifa at O2 Harrow store was amazing. She helped me with setting up a 40gb data plan. She was awesome, quick, and very polite. Just great experience overall and fast network.",2
Been with O2 for over 3 years and its the only mobile provider ill be with. Great customer service. Great signal for 4G across the whole UK. Great and affordable prices to fit around me. Recommend to all!,2
"I've bought a new iPhone and Frank at o2 shop Fulham helped me to set up everything and switch from my old Samsung to the new phone, very happy with their service.",2
Today i had a pleasure of speaking to Stephanie in o2 branch in houndshill shopping centre my mom was Liliana and i were upgrading to new phones. Stephanie explained everything step by step and was absolutely lovely and amazing would recommend her to anyone without thinking great service and approach to the customer deserves a pay rise. Thank you for great experience Stephanie,2
"I've been with O2 ten years or more. On Saturday 4 May 2019 i phoned O2 to upgrade 2 phones and 2 tablets. Paul answered the pnone almost straight away.  From the start he was extremely polite, helpful and friendly in a professioal way.  I told him what I wanted and he led me through the procedure. As I was upgrading 4 devices it took a little while and was a bit repetitive however Paul remained upbeat and attentive throughout. He made sure he understood my needs and that I understood every stage. I must emphasise Paul was extremely clear in his pronunciations which helped me understand every aspect. He made me smile throughout the whole call and I came away very happy. Thank you Paul you are a real asset to O2!",2
Spoke with Emily on the phone about my Grandads phone bill and she was absolutely fantastic! She upgraded his contract to unlimited calls free of charge. He is house bound and this really helps him as he gets lonely so makes allot of calls. If I could give more stars I would! Thank you Emily,2
"Visited O2 New St, Bham today to buy a new phone for my husband. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Did all the changeover for us. Polite and friendly staff. Thank you to Scott and all the team.",2
Brilliant customer service on the phone from zubie Thankyou so much for your help and giving me information about my tarriff,2
"Been an O2 consumer/business customer for around 20 years, while we've had our fair share of problems over the years, they've always looked after me.  Had no issues when travelling to different countries.  Customer Services are good and coverage is excellent.",2
The only mobile phone network worth paying for.,2
"Extremely impressed with O2 customer service. I emailed about a small issue with regard to international data charges and was called back the next day by a very helpful agent who was able to resolve my issue within a couple of minutes. I do not usually write reviews, but was compelled to do so on this occasion as my previous experience of telephone companies is that customer service is a nightmare. Quite the opposite with O2. I am relatively new to O2, and will most definitely stay with them when customer service is of this high quality. Thank you to the agent I spoke to!",2
"I recently joined 02 and it is the best network I've ever been on, having tried Vodaphone and Virgin over the years.No issues with signal or the internet at all. Plus fantastic rewards on priority and money back on my spend so I'm quids in. Free Cafe Nero coffee, easter eggs, Thornton's mother's day chocs fantastic!",2
"Has an upgrade call with Peter Rigby, really helpful, listened to the issue and fixed it.I'd had a problem with my upgrade which he sorted",2
Ben the guru and staff at Aylesbury branch helped me and were patient with me.They all were wonderful. Thank you Ben the guru.I appreciated the help.I am 75year old you had great patience with me.10 stars to youValaine Bell..,2
Two weeks ago I bought a new phone from the o2 shop in Halifax which for me is quite a daunting task but I was looked after by a young lady called Emma and she made it a joy she was very knowledgeable and friendly she transferred everything I needed from my old phone to the new one and I was up running in no time. I would like to give my thanks to Emma and the O2 team in Halifax,2
"Excellent customer service when arranging for a new sim card to be delivered after my phone was unfortunately stolen. Made a stressful situation better, and the sim card arrived the following day. Thanks to 	Kamaljeet on live chat for the top service.",2
I must give 5 star to a kind lady called JADE she really show how professional she is ..I been having problems with o2 for a month now...but hopefully is resolved Jade thank you for you patience a kindness and your attitude made me calm and  I realized that Some people who work in costumer services at the o2 They need to learn loads with you thank you 🙏 I wish I could give u ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Never had any issues, been with them for years.",2
I don’t work for o2 I am a genuine customerBut I have had nothing but excellent customer service.I called them today as my payment was gonna be late they did a promise to pay for 10 days advised there would be a £3.50 late payment charge totally ok it is my fault.They understood my predicament and reassured me everything was ok. Fantastic 5 stars from meThank you o2,2
"I’ve been with o2 many years on pay and go never had a problem, I don’t think I’d use any other network",2
Twelve years with O2Never had a problemTariffs clear and service pretty goodThe only downside is roaming is not cheap outside the tourist areas!,2
"Ok, well My Son had had a text message that said ""thanks for subscribing to jamjar, £4.50 will be debited from your account every fortnight"" or something to that effect. My Son was confused and he said he had not subscribed to any one nor clicked on any links, hes a bright lad at university doing business studies and is very good with money and things like this so i knew he was telling the truth. i contacted o2 fraud team and the first person said we had to reply STOP to the number then ring a number that he gave me. My Son had deleted the text message knowing this was a scam and so we couldnt reply STOP to it, we tried the number and 3 loud beeps then dead, i though we had been told the wrong info from o2 so i rang again and what a great guy that sorted us, his name is Mohammed (Magic Mo) and he immediately refunded me the money, put a block on anymore coming through and also personally rang the company for me whilst i was on hold, sure enough i got text messages from o2 confirming all what he said. Not only did he help us he was really funny guy who made us both feel at ease and also made us smile, thanks MAGIC MO, you really are an inspiration to customer services. We need more like you. I really hope that this message gets back to him because these kind of people need to know they are doing a fantastic job. Thank you",2
"Kris in re-contracts was awesome, he made my decision very easy and was a pleasure to speak to, please make sure he gets this review.",2
My partner and i have been with O2 for quite some time now and have had little to no real issues. But i just wanted to say how incredibly helpful the staff in the Northfield store are! Pardeep was an absolute delight to sit with and he helped us with everything we needed in store and was really friendly.. he is a credit to the store!,2
Zara from Birms New Street is absolutelty amazing. Helped me with my upgrade,2
Got accepted the 9th June 2018 received the next day. I added another phone the 5th January and delivery the next day. Such an easy process. The customer service is excellent always helpful.,2
"Best phone company I used,  sends back cash rewards for topping up, cheap rates for the occasional user.  Sends out free sim cards to the UK.  If you lose your phone convenient to get your old number back.",2
Donna in the O2 Store in High Street Exeter was extremely helpful and fast in getting me sorted with my new Sony. Thanks Donna.,2
O2 Aylesbury has been an excellent when it comes to customer service. They made to a point that their customer will be satisfied and completely happy of their service. That is why I have been with O2 for more than 10 years because of their high standard which is excellent. Thanks to Jake who has been brilliant and very professional and so ever been so patient with us. O2 is highly recommended!!!,2
"Have recently subscribed to O2 Classic 3-2-1 PAYG scheme.  As you can tell it's pay as you go and you pay 3p for calls, 2p for texts and 1p per gig of internet.I now have two phones on this scheme and have to say it's fine. The rates are the same as that charged by 'Three' but, for me, the coverage seems better than Three. Also the O2 customer service has been absolutely superb.  They are based in South Africa - I have to say they have answered the phone quicker than anyone else .... (although I admit Asda Pay As You Go service was excellent too) ...and the O2 advisors have been great and were very polite, helpful and well informed. The PAC transfer from Asda to O2 was successful on both occasions. Obviously the other reviews reflect differing views but I can only speak as I find.",2
Flush the customer services fantatic well done,2
Very very happy with my experience from O2 customer services! Can’t thank them enough for their help,2
"Despite all the disruption in the last couple of days, the company have been absolutely fantastic over the years. I have had various company phones with other servers and I can't begin to tell you the comparison for me is obvious.I won't be switching any time soon. Thanks everyone at o2.",2
Have helped me when late business payers have not paid on time. They have no tied a rope over my connection like other provider stories I have heard.This problem is an equipment supplier upgrade issue not 02. It happens with office equipment.,2
Great service in o2 shop when setting up new sim,2
"Switched over from EE, had a good experience with o2 so far.",2
Thank you to Janice for all your help finally SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT SHES DOING!!!!! Unlike the previous person I spoke to that was arguing with my saying I was going to be charged £97 to change my direct debit dateMASSIVE SHOUT OUT TO JANICE!!!!,2
"O2 have been continously fantastic looking after me as a customer for over 15 years,I've had the phone for many years and also I had their broadband at one point (only reason I no longer do is because they sold to Sky) however they have always solved problems, give credit when needed (even at times when I have accidentally gone over minutes and not realised they've credited) so honestly, they're one of the best companies within the UK by far!",2
"We bought a new phone and an 02 contract via a reseller. It has all worked out well, so far.Looking at previous reviews for this company, as well as other mobile service providers, it would appear that there's much these companies can do to make our lives better and improve their procedures.More power to Ofcom to act, for starters and more competition.",2
"What's with the bad reviews? I have been with 02 for years, great company, no issues at all!! I give them 5 stars..",2
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I have just upgraded my phone with them. I was able to do it online, no trouble at all. Got the tariff I wanted, and sorted out my insurance. I ordered my new phone on a Tuesday morning, I had by lunchtime the next day. The delivery driver gave me an hour slot between 12-1 for delivery, so I didn't have to wait around all day. Very impressed with the service. That's why I've stuck with them.",2
"O2 has Brilliant Customer Service.Every time I need to check or change something on my account I just chat with them online, friendly staff, very helpful, always will give you the best tariff, will do some discounts.Nice Quick and EasyI wish  that other companies had the same Customer service",2
"I had a problem with my account, I phoned customer services,The lady that I spoke to was most helpful and explained what I was doing wrong, she has set me up with a new o2 Bundle as the one I had was dated,  o2 customer services have always listened and acted positively when I have phoned them, an excellent service,",2
"When starting a new O2 contract it's best to block all Direct bills to mobile, Premium bar and International Bar to start, you can always remove the bars later by calling customer service. On new contract or upgrade from 1 October 2018 you can now set a Spend cap at £0 to protect you from unexpected bills as you can always change this by calling customer service or MyO2 App. Most people on this form don't quite understand what a contract means. You are agreeing to pay them a monthly charge for 1 or 2 years plus any extras charges which you must pay on time. If you cannot guarantee you can afford it for the year(s) don't sign up use pay as you go no excuses please. Look after your phone and insure it, 2 years is a long time paying for something you have broken or had it stolen. I have used O2 (Cellnet), Vodafone, EE (One2One, T-Mobile & Orange), Tesco, Virgin and Three for over 32 years and I find now it's easier to buy my phone outright and look for the SIM only deals. It's so easy to change network with a PAC code and your number changes over the next working day and automatically cancels your existing contract.",2
"Best service I've ever had from a mobile phone store. I'd been with EE for years, but found the staff in that store unhelpful and unwilling to fix anything unless it meant selling you something new; the OPPOSITE with O2. After not having any success with EE I went into their store on Chapel Street, Southport, and they were willing to help me without the hard sell. I didn't commit that day, but went back and since then have had amazing help from Anna, Ken and Jo, who are always so friendly and willing to go out of their way for you. Prices better than EE, their knowledge and expertise far exceeds the competition, there's never that awful wait time that makes you reluctant to even go into a mobile phone store for help, so overall, a complete winner for me! I purchased their own brand ""1+"" phone- was going to go for the S9 and really was looking for a great camera, but the 1+ was the winner. Am delighted with my phone!",2
"Good Company with practical prices on iPhones which I was looking for will be returning for a new contract.I have just recently moved from EE and their greedy antics for new iPhones is just vulgar.£80+ for new iPhone and 3 gb of data what use is that to anyone when EE and most sites such you towards the internet they forget that when they offer overpriced contracts and dish out 3gb of data its obscene and they should be ashamed of themselves.O2 have been nothin but helpful 50gb of data, free calls, free texts best that EE.",2
"After dropping my s8+ i decided to claim on my insurance, i have to admit 02 where brilliant. They asked a few questions over the phone, arranged to collect it next day then confimed a day later they had recieved it. Just a few hours later i recived an email to confirm i would have a new phone the next day! Super fast service and great customer service. Thanks 02",2
"I am continually surprised with the efficiency of O2 Customer Service and also their Insure team so would like to extend my thanks to them. My phone got stolen on Saturday for the second time in a year and they were just absolutely brilliant at resolving it extremely quickly. Everyone I spoke to on the phone were kind, compassionate and sorted it at incredible speed.Yes, I do find O2 average in terms of price; however, I honestly think it is worth it because with other companies the customer service lacks where it absolutely should be. For these reasons I've been with o2 for 10 years and will continue to be with them. Thank you O2.",2
"I've been with o2 since the first iPhone and think they offer a fantastic service.Recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max, was due to upgrade in November, but o2 offered to cancel the remaining £70 left on my current phone contract and upgraded me early.Phoned customer services to check some details on my order and the lady I spoke to was really helpful.I also needed a new SIM card for a PAYG number I have. I used LiveChat for this, and the agent was great. Got my SIM card and I am really pleased!Thanks o2!",2
"Been with o2 for many years and like the way they do things which is simple and start forward,have renewed with them again just last week.Can not fault them they are helpful when u need them when things go wrong or to check what the fault is in my area.Always looking to improve the service.",2
"The service I received in the Carmarthen branch today was excellent.  The two chaps were friendly,knowledgeable and polite. An absolute credit to your company.  Good people are hard to come by. Whatever you do, don't let them leave. I've already recommend that branch to several colleagues.Many thanks.Alice",2
"I decided finally to give my ancient iPhone 4S heave ho with something a bit more up to date. I could do so and get more minutes on my contract and yet still pay less per month than I was with my 4S (silly me for sticking with it for so long). Nonetheless this did require my number to be transferred to a new SIM which, mercifully O2 did for me without complication or delay. Just to wrap up, I ordered my replacement phone at 18:00 on Wednesday, it arrived with me at 16:00 on Thursday - now that's efficiency. In all my years with O2, they've seldom let me down and I would not hesitate in recommending them to anyone.",2
Love my iPhone X on my upgrade. Good deal!!,2
"Absolutely lovely experience ! Called up to ask to pay for my bill later on , received top service and got it all sorted.  I work in customer service myself and I hope I'll get to speak like that on the phone one day ! Thank you Matt from Customer Service !!!",2
"Good prices, good service via chat, FB & 202, Priority & O2 app are fun, no dodgy bills. Best of big 4 for contract & paygo. Only network that does internal number migration too.",2
"I've been with O2 going on a decade, and I have to say, it's unlikely that I will go anywhere else while they're around. I've never had any issues with signal, or customer service, their insurers have always sorted me out quickly and without any hassle (And I break A LOT of phones!) and my upgrades have always been easy.I also LOVE the O2 Priority benefits. I use them constantly for ticket purchases, and meals out - their offers are always attractive and relevant to me. It's a real draw to being with O2.",2
"Been with O2 for many years and got to say - think they are great.  Reinforced today when I moved my daughter's account over.  She had been with Three - shocking/awful customer service.  Phoned O2 about a bolt on which I had unwittingly signed up to with UNICEF, they sorted it instantly.  Three.... I was passed round 3 different people, insincere service, shabby.  Glad the family are all now with O2",2
Just taken out another contract with O2.They always provide good network coverage and the 02 rewards system is a nice bonus.,2
"After a crisis involving much confusion and distress, O2 came out on top. Immediate replacement of Sims, advice, updates and support. O2 White Rose, Leeds, staffed exceptionally. Especially Sam. Up and beyond the call of duty, patience in abundance, calm, friendly and above all professional and no pressures.",2
Jody from the billing department has helped me out a lot and gave extremely good customer service.Friendly!Listens to you!And also treats you as a person rather than an opportunity.Lovely staff member you have here named Jody! 10/10!!!!,2
Great company with a fantastic rewards scheme. Staff in shops are friendly and the tariffs are compative.,2
"I have a periodic problem with O2 that means occasionally some contacts can't ring or text me even though I can ring and text them. No one at O2 has ever been able to get to the bottom of it and indeed liked to shrug off responsibility and pass the buck to the other networks. HOWEVER, yesterday at Surrey Quays branch, lovely Naz was determined to get to the bottom of it and, with the help of the Network tech team, solved it! I'm ever so grateful to Naz and think he deserves 10 stars! Turns out a network upgrade (I think) has the effect of no longer recognising numbers originally ported from other providers. It's as if the network thinks the numbers are no longer in use.",2
I had managed to drop my phone Have been with 02 for years Decided to visit the 02 shop on the Parade in Leamington Spa Warwickshire Dina the assistant there could not have been more helpful. MyOriginal phone was beyond saving but gave me good advice and sorted new one with no problem When my contract is due. I will visit the shop rather than use on line. Thanks againVaughan,2
"Every single time I've gone into O2 over the last few years the Gurus have been so helpful, kind and patient.Simply wonderful customer service in my opinion",2
I’ve been a happy customer with O2 for a number of years. I generally get a decent network connection and I feel I’ve got a great tarrif price.,2
I’ve been with these guys for the longest. Deal with issues pronto.,2
"Had to close some accounts for my husband but due to his poor English it was a struggle to talk to them as they wouldn’t speak to me but my husband even when we went into the branch they told us to call again.I called yesterday and I spoke to Zola and he was so kind and helpful. He spoke to me throughout the call so I could translate to my husband and he asked some security questions which I did then have to pass the phone onto my husband and tbh having done that before they would always say that my husband needed to speak but they always failed to understand him . Zola helped us with our enquiry and then transferred us to Sadam who also was so kind and helpful because of Zola and Sadam I don’t think we would have got our things done! Sadam was very nice and explained promptly to us and answered all our enquiries . He would put us on hold to actually go and get the right info ! He even advised us to recycle our old phone.I only gave o2 5* because of Zola and Sadam, or else I tbh had worse experience with o2!I was so admired by their time and effort and their service I honestly never write reviews but I was treated so well that I couldn’t resist!They were so patient and dealt so well with usI wasn’t sure about their names as I only got to ask one of them but today I received a text regarding the service and now I have their names and tbh they need a pay rise ASAP! Even a promotion😜Because no one has ever taken that much effort into work like them ... most of o2 customer service only want to get rid of you ASAP and end your call -_-",2
The best car insurance I ever had.Cost-effective solutions and direct client approach.Flexible and cheapI could never have thought that a telephonic brand could have offered this massive service.Very good Job,2
"Went in to the spindles store in Oldham town centre and was seen by Mark. He was knowledgeable, helpful and an all round nice guy that gave honest advice and helped me find the right deal. Working in retail myself, I understand the importance of returning customers and it’s safe to say next time I need a phone I’ll be returning due to marks excellent customer service👍👍",2
On Monday I need to contact O2 to get three number changed two new numbers I spoke to a lady called Sally in South Africa she was first class and provided me with everything that I needed I was wowed I'd like O2 if they read this to pass on my thanks for a job well done JP,2
The best customer service out there bar none. Friendly knowledgable staff who are clearly striving to make a difference. Have never had a bad customer experience in the last 7 years. Stands out as Vodafone previously were dreadful dreadful dreadful.,2
noticed so many bad reviews so thought id chip in. Been with o2 for over 10 years. Never any issues. Very happy still. Sometimes people only write reviews when they've got a rant :),2
Lovely customer service. Made EE seem even worse which I didn't think was possible!Very easy to get hold of someone on instant chat if you have a problem. Always desperate to help you- I had a technical issue that was fixed straight away. I was apologised to for the error.I've also been mad to feel like being loyal customer actually means something to o2. o2 priority is an added bonus that rewards customers. I've also had the best reception since I switched from EE. I frequently went without service until I switched o2!,2
"Great service - whenever I have an issue they really work hard to solve it. I moved away from o2 because I found a rolling monthly contract elsewhere cheaper, but after 2 months I came back - can’t fsult the service.",2
"Great customer service received from ELROY- customer advisor at O2! Very professional, helpful and proactive guy! Thanks for sorting out my case! Would definitely stay with O2  😊",2
"Ok I can see there is a tone of bad reviews here but I honestly love 02 I haven’t had one single problem with them, I never loose connection, there’s 02 refresh which is extremely handy, there’s so many good points to 02. I was with Vodafone for a long time and they were a extremely poor company compared to 02 so 5* I know this may seem or appear like a joke review considering all the bad remarks against 02 on here but it’s a honest genuine opinion from my experience with them.",2
"I've been a customer for probably 10 years or so now - and never, ever had a single problem. For a telecoms company I think this is pretty good. Thank you for all your excellent service over the years.",2
Just spoke to Matthew on live chat and he went above and beyond to help me. Fab service. Makes a pleasant change. Thank you Matthew,2
"Upgraded my phone online yesterday and had realised once it had been dispatched that I had ordered a 32gb instead of a 128gb, once the phone was delivered this afternoon I took it to my local o2 store (west quay Southampton) still completely sealed where I was greeted by a man leaning on a counter who couldn’t of cared any less about what I had to say and told me there was nothing he could do and sent me on my way, I then thought I would try my luck in the o2 shop 2 minutes away the above bar Southampton store where one of your employees was so helpful and said he was unsure on whether he could help because it had been purchased online but asked us to take a seat whilst he went to find out what he could do, a man named Ben then came over and said he would need to contact someone to see if it was possible, which he then found out it was, he then started the process, he was very friendly, had a laugh, recommended some apps and sent me on my way with the phone I had wanted all along, had it not of been for Ben today my score would of been 1 star! Although it was my fault for ordering the wrong phone and had Ben of found out he couldn’t help I would of appreciated his efforts anyway! But I’m very pleased with my new phone! Thanks Ben!",2
Great customer service. Never had a problem with them across my several devices and years with them. Much better than EE and Vodafone who I’ve been with in the past,2
The best network provider. After a rubbish 6 months with another provider was so pleased to be able to have 3&4g on my mobile. I love 02 and have had to increase my data due to being able to use it in my area,2
Poor customer service. Issue still remains. Will be cancelling direct debit until it is sorted and at end of contract will not be with o2.I have amended this review because O2 have addressed all of my concerns and I continue to be a customer. I have even taken out car insurance with them.,2
"Seem's to be some real hating on O2, which to be honest surprises me...maybe more to do with the fact people are more likely to share bad experiences perhaps?Personally I've had nothing but good for all the years I have been with them. coverage is spot on, service is great, perks are fantastic (love my free coffees and early gig ticket sales). Also love how O2 where the first of the main networks in the UK to split out the phone and network costs making upgrading easier. Also made roaming abroad not cost the earth and will be part of standard usage in 2018.So yeah, feel this positive review might be just a drop in the ocean of bad  ones but hey, there are some of us who are happy with 02 :)",2
Excellent customer service from Michael in the Manchester call center! 🙂,2
Just great. I moved from Vodafone 12 months ago as they had become truly shocking. I've O2 to be a breath of freshair. The help instore is great. The network is more reliable that Vodafone's and with better coverage in my experience. 12+ months in they've just called me to pro-active offer to reduce my price for the same sim only bundle! Brilliant.,2
"I have been a user of O2. Mobile for well over 20 years. They have nearly always been fast, efficient and trouble free. The one time I complained they were fast, efficient and friendly at responding to my complaint and went out of their way to help, resolving the issues almost immediately. Unlike most companies these days they responded and resolved the problem and apologised for the inconvenience not within months, weeks, days or even hours. But within minutes. Yes minutes. And it was resolved by a section manageress, showing that they took the complaint seriously and cared about their customers. Faultless service from O2 customer services and faultless service from O2 ever since. One of the few companies that I would not hesitate in recommending, and as far as pay as you go is concerned, one of the best.",2
"I absolutely love being an 02 customer! They are efficient and helpful in every respect. I receive great 02priority treats every week for being a customer, and they go out of their way to keep my bills as low as possible. I am also always up to date with the latest handset.",2
"Called in the 02 shop at the Deppdale Centre, Preston this morning.I just needed a new SIM for an iPhone I didn't buy from 02.Really good, prompt and very friendly service.  A credit to 02.",2
O2 are the best phone network that I have ever been with. Excellent customer service,2
"Been with O2 ever since they took over BT Cellnet (20 years?).  Wonderful, very friendly and helpful staff. If there is ever a problem, it's sorted quickly and efficiently. Always received the right advice on new handsets and deals. The best network around! 😀",2
"I have been a customer with o2 for years and never had any issues. I fancied and early upgrade so I used their live chat function today to see if I could arrange this.I ended up speaking with a manager and got a great deal on a new handset.Overall, very happy with o2 and the service they provide.",2
"Visited O2 shop at Westwood Cross today. We were apologised to firstly as they were extremely busy. However, after only a few minutes we were attended to by a young man who I believe was David Saunders, he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, he certainly knew what he was talking about. We came away with better terrific than we had had previously and my husband's new phone was up and running in no time. Thank you David for your personal service today.",2
Just had a very good experience with o2 customer service. They supplied me with a like-for-like temporary replacement phone and credited me a month's bill due to an on-going very poor experience with customer service at Huawei who have had my phone in for repair for almost five weeks.I should have given my phone to o2 for repair but I stupidly contacted the manufacturer directly - last time I make that mistake.,2
Been with O2 for 3 months now on a SIM only deal. Extremely happy with network coverage and internet speeds in West London. So far didn't need to call Customer Service for anything major... Glad I left the other network for O2.I tried all the big mobile phone players... O2 is on top of the list.,2
My boyfriend really needed a new phone and contract and after being turned down by EE was getting worried he wouldn't be getting one however Olivia in the west quay Southampton branch was super helpful was able to a great phone and contract for a good monthly price! Very happy with her service!,2
"Amazing service from O2.  My daughters phone was stolen on Sunday night. Visited the Notting hill store on Monday am. They helped us get a crime number on line, reordered the phone, the replacement phone came the very next morning before 10am.  Great service from staff. Well done",2
I used O2 chat today to get my previous phone unlocked. Customer service was top notch from Kevin.  Thank you O2 you did a great job today,2
I've just come back to O2 with a sim only pay as you go after spending 2 years with another network never having a signal indoors.The main reason for returning to O2 is because I always get a good signal both anywhere  indoors and outdoors.The £10 monthly pay as you go bundles are great valueThe one time I've spoken to customer services when moving my number back to O2 they were very helpful and polite.,2
Excellent service at the Tottenham Hale branch this morning was having trouble with my new Samsung phone... staff  could not do enough for me....well done good to see such great service...,2
"Been with O2 for years. If we ever get a problem our local O2 store is brilliant, manned by young switched on staff who will do anything to help. Never had anything but exemplary and friendly service. Faultless.",2
"Good network, reliable, helpfull customer service and friendly app. Been with them for the last 10months. I tried before giffgaff, Three, Vodafone and O2 is so far the best network for my needs.",2
"Spoke to Derek in customer services at lunchtime on 12.05.17 who was fantastic, he was cheeful , helpful, and dealt with my query in a quick proffessional manner, o2 have always been great when ive dealt with them but Derek shone like a little star.",2
"I have now left o2 and moved to another provider due to an introductory offer.Moving companies has made me appreciate how good O2 were. Everything they did was efficient. Even leaving O2 was easy. It was easy to get through on the phone, they did not try to hard sell, they just did what they were supposed to do.Having used Orange, Virgin Mobile and BT I would say that O2 are the best of the bunch",2
"I went to o2 in Shrewsbury  yesterday. I am a senior agent in customer services, I can honestly say the service I receive from Declan was outstanding. I have upgraded my contract to the new samsung a5. He was so helpful and made it all stress free. Please pass on this feedback and tell him he is great at his job.",2
"Over the years I used O2, I had very few issues and the customer service was always a pleasure!",2
"I ordered a 25GB Unlimited Minutes & Texts SIM-ONLY plan for £25 from O2 last year.I was emailed every step of the way during the progress of my SIM, all the way to dispatch.Once it came, I popped it into my handset and realised that 4G wasn't working.I went on the o2 site and spoke to an online agent who informed me that the 4G bolt on needed to be activated.They turned on 4G and told me it would take 24 hours to activate.The next day it was on perfectly.4G has been quick. no billing issues or anything else. Just a smooth service so far.",2
"Brilliant customer service. Been with them for 10years or more now and I was setting up a contract on the phone the other day with a very nice fella called Liam, very kind/helpful.",2
"I have to say, I was not with O2 for all that long as the 3G/4G coverage in the West Country wasn't great ....... yet.However I chopped and change tariffs, had reason to change my handset in store and perform quite a few changes to my tariffs.Not once did it get messed up, the O2 app was always spot on and billing too. I can't imagine the pain I'd have suffered if I'd tried to get VF to do any of this!In fact due to EE's poor indoor coverage I wanted to return to O2 but they can no longer offer the SIM deal I used to have :-(Anyway, regarding customer service, billing and shop staff in Falmouth, Cornwall ....... Well done O2",2
I've had an issue with O2 company that was lasting for 3 months until I spoke with guru Thomas Greenhalgh and fixed the problem when I didn t expected anymore.Really professional and great man! Thanks a lot!,2
"I went into the Manchester Arndale store today to purchase a new phone. The service I received from Sarah was absolutely brilliant. I am not a big mobile phone user. I only have one for emergencies really. Sarah sorted me out with just what I needed and then actually sorted the phone out ready for me to use. I also wanted to change my contract to one that suited my needs more than the one I had and she sorted all that out for me as well !!!!! I was absolutely amazed at the brilliant service she provided.I've used the same store a few times in the past and always been happy with the service, but today was exceptional. Thank you Sarah.",2
Must say a big thank you to the manager and staff members Laura and Scott for o lot of patient and helpful assistance today.  This is in marked contrast to the experience at the Kirkcaldy 02 shop.Problems completely resolved in a friendly and competent way.Many thanksIan,2
Customer Complaints team resolved my issue.,2
For 5 years I had a mobile contract with 02 via Carphone warehouse.Never had a problem and never had to contact them.,2
"After spending 2 years on the iphone 6, i thought i was gonna cancel the contract and just find another phone company but i decided to stay and upgrade toa iphone 7 and my monthly payments went down from £20 a month to £17 a month. Nice one O2 !",2
I have delt with 02 on many occasions and never had any problems there staff are very helpful and hard working.  They would do anything to make it alot easier. I would send anyone to this company that's how confident I am.,2
"In the office i work i have people telling me that i should move to another network for better 4G, more internet data, better coverage or cheaper bills, then i hear the same people saying how they have or are changing networks because of problems they are having. I have been with O2 for about 15 years and have never had an issue with them.  Always offer a good service with good deals and the refresh package is second to none and O2 priority is excellent.  Taking into account all the issues i hear from my work colleagues have had with their networks i don't see O2 is any worse than the others, i would love to see more reward for loyalty, but then that applies to a majority of companies.Keep up the good work.",2
"I came over from a different Network,from using my P.A.C Code to speaking to them on the phone, there was one issue but got sorted out immediately and then they credited £10.00 pounds too on my account, better coverage and Network-can't fault them at all. Don't know what these whingers are going on about they've been very helpful and not had a problem.Keep up the good work o2My Number is 07712492916",2
Would recommend everyone ✔But stay away  from EE,2
"Thank you to O2, Merseyway, Stockport, for superb service.  My much-valued old phone suddenly packed up, only functioning for a few seconds at a time.  The assistant was very helpful in explaining how to use my choice of new phone.  Even better, after a lot of effort and time, he finally managed to blue tooth across all my old contacts, which I would have lost otherwise.  Given the old phone would only function for seconds, it was amazing he managed to do this.  He also transferred all my photographs.  I am really grateful for the excellent service and would definitely recommend this shop.",2
No problems with this service except when coverage was confirmed to be low in my area.,2
I have been with O2 for many years now after leaving Orange due to stupidly high bills - going over my allowance constantly - and really poor coverage. I have nothing bad to say about the service provided by O2 apart from when someone fraudulently upgraded my account to a blackberry from an address in London - but they dealt with this superbly once they knew about it. Have recommended and my dad swapped after being with orange for 20 years.,2
I switched to a sim only contract. 1 month later I realised I needed more data allowance than I had - O2 have a 3 month policy before switching but the guy on the phone convinced his manager to switch me to a higher data tariff for less money. Best service ever.,2
Excellent customer service me and my wife received from George Wade at Colliers Wood branch.Top class experience. You need more staff like him. His services should be rewarded. Mr Nurse.,2
"I have been using the live online chat for a while now and every time I am 100% satisfied. The people are polite, concise, helpful, know hat they are talking about, and it never lasts longer than 15 mins. My phone was fixed within the blink of an eye too. I highly recommend the live chat.",2
"Never had any problems with O2.They don't charge for customer service, like EE do.They allow pay as you go customers to use 3g for £1, which is good for emergencies. EE makes you sign up to a £10 pack that only gives you 1GB.I've always had good experiences with their customer support.Would recommend.",2
Excellent customer service. Had an issue with my phone Matt sorted it out quickly. He was excellent I'd employ him tomorrow. Credit to 02 and the Dover store,2
I've been with o2 for about ten years. In this time I've had no issues with them at all over mobile contracts or broadband (back when they provided broadband). Their phones can be expensive - I bought my phone outright from another company and have a sim-only contract that works absolutely fine. Good coverage and uptime. Would recommend to friends and family.,2
"I absolutely love o2 , they are amazing and have a really good customer service. They also go out of there way to help people , well they have helped me a lot , i got a new contract with them at beginning of May 2016 and the phone came the next day and I have got the new iPhone 6s and they helped me set it up over the phone because I didn't have a clue how to set my Apple ID up and they talked me through it , they also told me if I couldn't afford the first months bill all in one I could pay it in two parts amazing highly recormend",2
"Ok, to start with, I've switched to o2 a couple of years ago and during my time with them, i lost my phone with the sim card. Went online and spoke to one of their gurus on chat. They sorted everything out straight away, old sim card blocked, new sim card with my number on the way, received it the next day. God I love o2. I'm on holiday now abroad and thanks to o2 travel bolt on I had activated months ago, i don't have to worry about using data or receiving phone calls. I can just use my phone as i do in the uk for £1.99 a day,no limit. My partner is on ee and every time we travel, it's the same story. He rings them up before we go to activate roaming just to having to get i touch with them again when it doesn't work. He'll be switching to o2 as soon as his contract is over. Well done o2, that's how it's done.",2
"I have been a customer with 02 for around 5 years.  I have had my issues as with any large organisation over the years.  I am writing this because over the last few years I have noticed O2 have made significant improvements in the way they conduct business (for me personally anyway).  I shop at a number of O2 stores but I would like to mention the team at Galleria in Hatfield.  They are professional but relaxed and always smiling.  The even remembered us the last time we went in.Another fantastic improvement has been their online payment system.  This used to be the worst part of my month as Im not on DD and I have 3 bills to pay. They have improved the system so much and it makes my life a lot easier.  This tells me they are focusing on continuous improvement and thinking about the customer me.Now, check out some of my other reviews and you will understand I can be critical, but in this case well done O2.  In my experience you are not perfect, but you are a million times better than companies like Vodafone!Keep improving.Paul Rhodes",2
"I can see a large number of bad reviews on here for O2. However, set up a SIM only contract with them for my mum. Her number was ported from another provider very quickly and hassle free and no bother with O2 customer service.The contract is a bit pricey and could be more competitive, compared to some other providers, but you do get what you pay for. Mobile Signal in her area is good too.I hope O2 try and address the bad experience that other reviews on here have had, it would be nice to think a company of that size would try.",2
"I have been with O2 on and off for over 10years (off because I went abroad) and compared to other companies they have given me a good experience throughout this time. If I ever have a problem I actually like calling them (which is not the case with other companies) because firstly I can understand them (English spekaing people, no call centre in India), secondly they always help, explain well, waiting times are very short, when in the queue the music is nice (and does not make me fall asleep or burst my ears). Bills are well explained, easy to look up, same goes for checking your left over minutes, text, data from your plan. I love the perks of O2 priority, in fact have gotten many presents for my son for FREE this way (and he was a happy little boy) and love the £1 lunch Mondays.Anyone looking for a hassle free, easy to deal with plan and company might want to check out O2. Even when I left them it was easy to obtain my PAC Code, no hard sales tactics, no wasting my time, instead a friendly ' Is there anything we can do?'. This is how it should be and this is why I went right back to them when I came back to the UK.A system that works, friendly and helpful customer service....thank you O2.",2
"I've been with O2 for six years now, first as a Pay & Go customer and now currently as a Pay Monthly customer, and I've never encountered any major issues. Just recently, after going through a painful two month ordeal with a certain Hong Kong based online electronics retailer, I ordered a sim-free Sony Xperia Z5 from O2's online store and the item was delivered to my local O2 branch the following day without problem. It was totally worth spending the little bit extra to buy a phone from a reputable company.In terms of their customer service, whenever I have an issue or query, or simply need my number changed, I find the online chat service offered by O2 to be very good - with most matters sorted within minutes.The only issue I've had over the years is, since moving to my current address, I have never been able to take out a new contract directly with O2. Instead I have had to acquire a Pay Monthly contract with O2 through Carphone Warehouse, such was the case with my current contract. But I suspect that's more to do with the credit check company rather than with O2 itself.",2
Took 2 hours to up grade as the email service was playing up and couldn't confirm my contract and give me a link. Paid £9.99 to have the phone delivered between 6.00pm and 10pm tonight. It was delivered to my neighbour at 2.00pm and the guy said we are a bit early. All in all a totally abysmal service. My advice is go elsewhere as o2 are a massive failure. I do not give them 5 stars that came up automaticly I would give them minus 500.,2
"Went in the other day as I had bought myself a recon Apple iphone 5, but not from them. I was expecting short shift as I walked passed all the new shiny phones they sell, but no, what I got was the most patient and helpful 'Stacey' who with the manager made me a new mini sim card. I am already an O2 customer but I got a tariff to suit my needs, nothing more. I can honestly say that the customer service was excellent, even on a busy Saturday. My son and I are both O2 customers and we are both planning on staying with them. Well done O2 in Brentwood, Essex, maybe some of the other O2 employees should spend a day there 'training'! Ask for Stacey, the most patient person ever.",2
My wife and I have been 02 customers for about 6 years.  We moved house recently and regrettably due to poor reception on our mobile phones we had to switch providers.  Over the years 02 have provided an excellent service and their staff have always been helpful.  Other mobile phone companies especially Vodafone could learn a lot about how to treat its customer from 02.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this company,2
We as a household have been with o2 for many years and never have we not been satisfied with them.Always helpful and sort out any problems we have .Very rarely do we suffer any signal problems .We find them excellent and even though sometimes there tarriffs can be more expensive we find it more benifical  to stay with them as the service they provide so out weighs any other mobile network we had previously been with..Thanks o2,2
"For those of you in London, my O2 coverage has been far superior since I swicthed from EE. The internet runs faster and I have less dropped calls.The customer service centre always resolve my issues, though sometimes they do keep you on hold for longer than you would like.I've renewed my contract with O2 for another year, even though I could pay less with another provider.",2
"Love O2, best mobile phone company I have been with. Stuck with them for several years and have No plans to move as a Customer.I recently added my Partner to my Contract. All good.Looking forward to my Upgrade in a few months.The only downside is when O2 goes down in our Area. But doubt we are the Only ones this happens too.Always found Customer services in store and online very helpful myself.",2
I like o2. I used them years ago without issue and I also had my broadband with them until they sold to sky. Their customer service was always second to none so I returned to them or my latest contract on a really great deal. Sadly it wasn't to be as the signal in my area wasn't very good and 3g in my area was non existent so I have had to cancel under the 14 day cooling off. However they were delightful about the whole thing and really helpful. I will update further if it was all too good to be true but for now....I wish I could have stayed with them!,2
"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Edge s7 phone at 6.30 at night and it arrived next morning.  I did it through live chat. It was superb.  Today I wanted to get my old number back and didn't have a clue how to do it so used Live Chat again.  I got a guru within seconds of logging on.  Abishek was chatting to me within seconds of logging on- he was pleasant and very knowledgeable- he answered my query perfectly and activated the number. Perfect customer service experience twice in one week and delighted with my s7... it's powerful, beautiful, the camera is amazing and it is a million times more durable than any other phone on the market.",2
"Very.co.uk should be trained by your staff, they are always helpful and rectify any issues there and then... Been with 02 for 5 years and have received excellent service throughout",2
"spoke to Tracy at o2 about my tariff and in no time at all she changed to something more suitable, no fuss, thank you Adrian Gardner",2
"I have been an O2 pay monthly customer for almost 5 years. I decided to upgrade early for my birthday as I'm on the 'refresh' tariff. Paid the remaining £100 balance for my old phone and ordered a Samsung S6.I ordered it to be delivered the next day before 10.30am.The phone arrived at 7.04am the next day, which was great because I do the school run from 8.30am-9am.Absolutely no issues with delivery or the actual phone which I have now owned for just under a week.I also called O2 to change my phone number which they managed to do quickly. The new number was active within the hour.I rarely have to contact o2 customer services, but when I do I feel that the staff always deal with me in a professional  manner.",2
I rang up trying to get my grandparents reconnected with their pay as you go sim as BT landline unavailable leaving them vulnerable.Straight through to payasyougo line (unlike other companies where you have to listen and press about 20 different buttons in order to speak to someone) then within 20 minutes my grandparents were up and running and connected again such a relief when they live so far away.Thank you O2,2
My name is Lucy and I popped into O2 store at frenchgate centre Doncaster to try and transfer all my files from old phone to new one. And had amazing service from a guy Steve. Helped with everything nothing was too much trouble. Also informed me of a better offer with 15% off my current sim only contract that I didn't know about so transferred to that. He sorted everything with my phone was so friendly polite. Very nice person. You have a really good staff member there.I have been with O2 for years and never had a problem with them ever xThanks very SteveLucy,2
"I called O2 in order to receive a PAC code so that I could change networks (no faults with O2, just wanted to try a different one). When I rang the number through my land line, I was answered with an automated reply of 'the number you have called is receiving a large number of calls so service may be slow' followed by 'press 1,2 or 3 for various lines'. I continued to press the numbers to go through to the correct extension, and was prepared for a long wait and awful music. However, the phone started to ring immediately and was answered not even after the first ring. The man who answered was lovely and cheerful, he started going off the usual scripted questions on what he could do to help, followed by my reason for leaving O2. Although he mentioned if I would be interested in a cheaper tariff, he did not keep pushing or try to sell the company any further, and went on to ask me the security questions in order to get the PAC code. Then while he was typing and generating the code, he started chatting to me about his day and asking me about mine while I waited, before giving me the code when he got it. An absolutely lovely man, genuinely concerned and interested in helping me as the customer. The best over the phone service I've had; I'm having second thoughts of leaving O2! It was a wonderful start to the day (I rang in the morning), and although I may have been lucky in the service I received compared to other reviewers, I am left incredibly impressed with O2.",2
"My mother was having problems with her phone and is quite Ill at the moment finds it hard to remember and can get quite confused, she was well looked after in store and given a glass of water. Nicola at Bangor store looked after her excellent. Thanks Nicola, phone is working great and on the best tariff for her thanks to you :). I wish that all shopping places had a Nicola to help!",2
Just renewed my contract after being offered a great deal upgrading (and I always shop around).. I have always found customer services with o2 one of the best. Never used a o2 store so can't comment on that as always been online or via phone but always found they've gone out of way to accommodate any queries or problems etc. Sorry the people in other reviews have had such an awful time and unneeded stress.,2
Just phoned 02 as usuall friendly helpful brilliant,2
o2 customer service help me  with  my phone problems,2
"Ive been an O2 customer now for about 8 years.  Ive stuck with them due to the fact I can get a signal pretty much everywhere plus their UK based customer service has always been very good.I just upgraded and took out another 24m contract with O2, but had major problems with the courier company.  Not O2 fault.  However, O2 got involved, and stepped in to sort out the problem with the courier, keeping me informed all the way.  Their social media team in particular are excellent.After getting the phone I then popped into my local O2 shop to get a case and they did a great deal on one for me. Always been very impressed with this company and their aftersales.  Happy to be a customer of theirs for another 24 months.",2
"Had an issue with the phone I had purchased via a deal through Amazon for the Amazon Fire Phone. Spoke to Amazon who refunded the phone once sent back, and spoke to O2 who were happy to move me over to a brand new phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) free of charge.",2
"Spoke to 3 different people during swapping of my phone, one told me a cheaper deal from a different place, one told me to enjoy my sunday but called it funday, and one said 'I won't go home until i'm sure did has been done for you' Amazing people!",2
"Received a call from Keiran at 19:45 on Tuesday 24th February, was very professional and informative, helped me out massively and has left one very happy customer, being a member of HR for a call centre myself I know the pressure agents are under but can safely say Keiran is one of the best I have dealt with.",2
"I administer mobile accounts for our business and experience all networks on a regular basis, so would recommend O2 every time, as my considerable experience has shown them to be reliable and trustworthy, whilst offering some great little add-ons like TuGo, which has slashed our roaming costs.Vodafone are a big lumbering beast, whose decline in the mobile market is well earned.EE are very well polished and have slick marketing and an aggresive sales force, but after-care is terrible and actually getting customer services to deliver on their promises is like asking a politician for a straight answer.",2
"I've been with O2 for the past 4 years now (having gone back to them after poor experiences with other companies) and they have been faultless in every respect. The level of customer service provided in particular at their call centre has always been nothing short of excellent. I have just attempted to purchase a new mobile/contract through Carphone Warehouse and another network provider due to the fact that they were offering it at a cheaper price than O2. Having had a problem with the online order, I called Carphone Warehouse, and I can honestly say I have never received such appalling customer service. I'm now ordering the new phone with O2, and will happily pay the extra for the phone and monthly contract, knowing that if I need support I can rely on  them to provide it in the same friendly and efficient manner I've come accustomed to. I had a lucky escape with Carphone Warehouse, and won't stray again!",2
Hellobeen with O2 for 7 years live in London area it's a great network always willing to help me and compensate me when they are in the wrong..I've been with all the other mobile networks and they all never ever had this much good customer service O2 the best ....they have great O2 apps as well plus SIM cards are for free unlike other mobile networks they charge u for a replacement so in my eyes 02 are great.....,2
People always complaint but they are much better than most other service providers,2
"I don't have a perfect credit rating but o2 accepted my application without deposit for not 1 but 2 contracts, I have had nothing but a totally reliable quality service and am very happy with them.",2
"I have just changed from EE to O2And the service has been excellent.Alan Gillespie has dealt quickly, competently and effectively with all issues relating to the transfer.The same is true for the rest of the 02 team. A far cry from the incompetent service at EE.",2
"Had no signal for an hour now. This is a disgrace, how can a national network of complicated technology have a small temporary fault like this. Everything should be perfect all the time that's why I pay £10 a month. This missed hour accounts for 0.1% of that 10 pounds; I hope management sees this and I get something free.",2
"o2 are friendly and helpful, i have never had a problem with them or known anyone whom has!",2
"A pain and stress free process of transferring from contract to pay as you go. They refunded me £3 straight away for a mistake that I had made with not switching off mobile data on my phone, occurring £5. I have never really had any problems, only minor which have been sorted out quickly.The website is clear and the online chat is quick and so much easier than speaking on the phone. They have a good selection of phones to choose from.",2
"Good service but sometimes no coverage, no problem with your customer service only the network sucks sometimes.",2
"I have been using O2 for over 7 years now. I have contracts for myself, wife and children with them. The customer service is always spot on. You actually speak to a person not just someone reading a script. The online chat advisors are all very competent and know their stuff. The deals are ok and when I haven't been happy (upgraded to a Nokia once which was s***) they swapped it, cancelled the contract I had taken out no quibble and I just started again with a different phone. Yes you will probably get more minutes on another provider, but I have used Orange and Vodafone in the past. I also worked for Vodafone for 4 years and I know the industry well. O2 are excellent at what they do. Plus their network is built on what used to be BT Cellnet as a result the call quality is excellent. I have a Vodafone as my work phone, in poor signal areas (I live in Devon so we have many of these) My O2 phone still has a reception long after Vodafone loses it's signal. Even on remote parts of Dartmoor!",2
"Finding it extremely frustrating to replace my broken iPhone 5 charger, I contacted O2 to be advised which of their variety of chargers would be the best for me to purchase. I contacted their customer service via live chat due to my busy schedule. I was transferred to the correct department in seconds, and the second adviser provided a replacement charger free of charge. Fast, Convenient and very Satisfied customer!",2
"I apologize for my previous review (negative). It was not O2s fault at all, but mine. First I gave a wrong number of my mobile requesting to unlatch. They wrote to me that number doesn't exist. Then I realized it was wrong indeed. Then I gave them a number, but I again realized few weeks later after reading the 'chat' record, that it was wrong too. Then I supplied the correct mobile number. Then they asked for its IMEI number, which they said can be found by dialing *#06# and I did that with my new phone without realizing that I should have dialed the above numbers using the old phone which I needed unlatching. So again I provided a wrong number. Later on I realized my mistakes and provided the correct details. Within minutes everything was sorted. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. But the customer care persons on their 'chat' were all extremely polite all the time. It was completely my fault right from the beginning. So readers please disregard my previous comment. I apologize unreservedly to O2, and to you readers.",2
"I realise that when writing a review you can only go  by your own experience.  Looking at the O2 score so far it appears to be some way from perfect but I have to say that in terms of the O2 Broadband service I received before changing a couple of months ago, it was excellent.  Rarely did I need to contact their Broadband helpdesk but whenever I did I found them to be very knowledgable and very very helpful.The only reason I moved is that O2 was being taken over by Sky.  I decided to move to Virgin - what a mistake that was!",2
"I took my faulty pay as you go Nexus 4 back to O2 in Milton Keynes on the 1st November, as the bottom half of the screen wasn't registering any touch. They stated it could take up to 2 weeks to be repaired, but typically it's done in 4-5 working days.Queue Tuesday the 5th on November, the phone turned up at my door at 8am, just before I head off to work, working perfectly. Amazing turn around time, will definitely consider buying phones from them in the future.",2
"Any time I have problems, they are available to help on webchat very quickly which saves me calling. I rate them 5 out of 5 for webchat. Thanks, Rach",2
"i do hope I am not testing fate! I have been with Vodaphone (dreadful customer care) and Orange (service became worse and worse as prices went up and up), having had a mobile for 20 years. I actually have 6 numbers on my contract. O2 have astounded me with their service and although I sympathise with those who have had bad experiences, be very careful who you move too. I'm sure if you speak to O2 complaints department (free of charge on your handset) they will be happy to help as they do seem to be concerned with customers and their problems.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years now, and am pleased with the level of service I've had over the period of time I've been with them. They are very helpful and have friendly customer service team! I have had friends who are with Orange and there is a huge customer service difference. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a contract, PAYG or any other service O2 offer to go with them.",2
"I have been on vodafone (absolute scam), 3 (bad customer service in general) & orange which have all been a nightmare. O2 are by far the best provider all round and i have been with them for 2 years, customer service is great, signal is better than most, they dont overcharge you ormess you about, i even signed up to pay an extra £10 a month for an iphone5 just to be on o2 rather than any other network.At the end of the day, with sorting out issues you have to go direct to managers. Everyone working for any provider are going to be the same, it depends whos on the other end of the phone. Although it shouldnt have to be like it, if you get rudeness back from a representative, just hang up & redial and you will eventually find someone who will help you.Just remember, when you are feeling angry & frustrated with the service your given, thats when your more likely to write a review to express your frustration. The best way to find out what network is for you is to ask family and friends for their recommendations.",2
"I have been with O2 for over 2 years now, and have been very impressed with the following:1. The Great Mobile Phone Coverage2. The Fantastic Tariff3. The super fast 3G Speed and coverage.4. The Out of this world Customer Service.5. The amazing Free mobile phoneI could go on about just how great 02 are, however I believe the above five points pretty much clarifies why I rate 02 at one of the best mobile phone providers in the UK, that I have had the pleasure to use.I cant wait for my next mobile phone upgrade and tariff review, as I am more than confident it will add even more value for money.Well done O2.",2
"I've never, ever had any trouble whatsoever with O2, was a pay and go customer for four years and the only reason I ever left the network was because the signal coverage for where I had moved to was poor. Something which O2 told me they'd look into when I told them I was leaving, no pressure from the salesmen on the phone who simply wished me luck and thanked me for my custom. I can always understand what the customer service representatives are saying and they are always helpful! Apart from my current location I have also never had any trouble with their coverage, signal strength and internet alike.",2
"My wife and I have only been with O2 for 3 months, but so far everything is perfect! Good signal, good deal on the new iPhone 5 and now we have decided to use their broadband service (Instead of Virgin Media's terrible broadband). O2 seems competent, friendly and has very friendly staff. Whenever I deal with them I go to their store on 286 Chiswick High Street. It is a bit out of my way, but the staff there is fantastic and they deserve 90% of the credit for making us stick with O2!",2
I am alwaye 02 customer this is best network & customer service in uk. I think the service is outstanding.,2
i love o2. best network and best service provider in the uk,2
"Even though we pay a bit more than other home broadband users, we've had really good service and connectivity. I'd recommend O2 anyday.",2
"I've been with O2 for 8 years and use them for my phone and internet.  I think the service is outstanding.  It is rare to find a large company that still genuinely cares about its customers.  On the rare occasion I have an issue, it is resolved immediately in a very considerate way (most of the time its my mistake).Bills always correct, signal is great, prices are reasonable to low but most of all their customer service is exactly what it says it is, a 'service for customers', something many companies have lost sight of.Please keep up the good work O2.  I think you are brilliant and actually enjoy calling your customer services.Thanks!!",2
I was experiencing problems with my original carrier and as unhelpful as they were O2 are extermely helpful and I have had no problems with their service.,2
"U get great signal all over and calls are really cheap, plus they give u goodies when u top up and I can talk to other o2 customer's for free x",2
"o2 is the best, but giffgaff uses them so cant complain with them too, best service, usually best deals, best customer service",2
"I am an O2 mobile and Broadband customer and have been using them for many years having been unsatisfied with Vodafone before.  They have great customer service and prices are decent.  Broadband wise, very quick speeds and easy to set up.",2
"Took my phone to the shop in cleveleys to buy a new charger, the girl that served me told me it was their responsibility to repair it as still under guarantee, which I hadn't realised, I was served within a few minutes, I was given a loan phone while mine was being repaired, within a few days I received my phone back, was kept informed at all times by text and phone call, I cannot praise them enough for their attention to detail, and the girl that served me was excellent. Thank you so much 02.Valerie jones.",2
"I've been with O2 for years now (at least 6) and I can't say that I have ever had a problem. I've always paid a reasonable amount, got a reasonable phone, had great reception (I know this depends on where you live) and whenever I've ever called them they have been quick to answer and very good at answering my question without passing me around some call centre.Ok, I do have one gripe - There contacts seem to be getting longer and longer. I'm sure at some point they'll give me a contract for life, but all the others do to so I can't moan too much.Overall (in my opinion) the best UK mobile phone company.",2
Somehow everything about them gives me a good vibe. I will always use O2. A happy customer!,2
"Whilst the signal strength in my area isn't great, I still achieve download and upload speeds well in excess of others in the area.3MB/s and 300KB/s where others can be as low as 300KB/s and 30KB/s or even less on a bad day!Their customer helpline has always been able to fix any problems quickly and courteously.",2
"I hear people find 02 customer service hard to get hold off, I've been with them for over 10 years now and have had no problems with them.",2
As a family we have three broadband sites and five mobiles and could not be happier. Whats more they have a uk help desk brilliant you can understand what they say well nearly it is based in Scotlaand. just joking.,2
"been with O2 for seven years, when contact O2 they have been very polite to resolve any queries we ever had and o2 priority moments have been extremely rewarding! I love them and no doubts that thy know how to keep customers happy! wanna free cuppa every week join O2!",2
"GREAT SERVICE, been with them for years and never any problems",2
"I have been with O2 for a number of years and have never found fault with the company. I have in fact persuaded my entire family and many many friends to switch to O2. Although I have been asked by other companies to use their services, I will never change.",2
Recently bought an O2 simcard on ebay that was a number I wanted but as I am with Tmob (dont get me started on them!) I had to transfer the new number. I contacted O2 customer service and the lady I spoke with was absolutely delightful!My son is an O2 customer and is always on to me to change to them...how I wish I had before taking out a new contract with Tmob.,2
"No - they may not always be the cheapest provider on the market, but their service is worth the little extra you pay in my opinion. No bad experience to date over several years of using them.",2
I have been with o2 since owning a mobile phone (many years). I have had no problems and will no doubt be with them for many years to come.,2
I will be sticking with o2 now and won't be changing provider again after my last mistake.Signal coverage is really good,2
Very good service would not go anywhere else,2
"All very handy and clear, fast and timely manner!",2
have been with this network for donkey years now. I am just too loyal to this company and have recommended it to people in past as much as i would continue to recommend it to others.,2
obviously im going to be a little bit biased about o2 as im an o2 customer but they are still one of the better network providers,2
A breath of fresh air after dealing with Orange..and I can get a signal now,2
"We've used o2 since it started, and having seen the experiences of competitors, we would not change.  The products are exactly right for us, as are the prices.",2
"Always been with O2, love the free O2 to O2 calls and online account management",2
Haven't used that often but enjoyed when I used it. Very easy to find stuff and use services.,2
"I have been an o2 customer for 15 years, and I have never had any complaints, their billis system is clear, their network is one of the best... my phone has signal 99.5 % or the time...",2
Have been with them for years without any problems. Staff a pleasure to deal with,2
"Have my contract with O2 not the cheapest but coverage is good and would not be without my iphone now, just waiting to upgrade at the end of my contract, christmas here we come !",2
I've used O2 mobile for years so that speaks for itself as I'm a person who looks for a bargain but without losing any quality. As soon as I heard  O2 were doing home phone and broadband I switched and am highly satisfied with the service. I advise all my family and friends to change to O2 as well.,2
"I love O2 and I love the 02 arena, it's my second home!",2
Good value and first class support and assistance,2
Not bad but can be better.  Top up web can be confusing.,2
Not the strongest signal but good contract.We are like an old married couple after all these years.,2
Great site so imformative and easy to use,2
"Never had any problems in all the time i have been with them, first rate company. *****",2
Best network coverage... Best deals.... Best prices... what else do we want?!,2
I HAVE BEEN WITH A FEW MOBILE NETWORKS BUT THE BEST ONE FOR ME IS O2. ALL MY FAMILY ARE ON O2 SO I GET FREE CALLS TO THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER MOST TO ME IN LIFE. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH 02 AND I SHALL STAY WITH THEM.,2
been with o2 for most of my 'mobile life'. great reception and great offers. best for contract deals.,2
"Use here in the Uk, I travel the world and I have never had any problems with connection, even in the remote parts of Africa, my trusted friend.",2
once I thought Vodafone is the Best.But now I know the best.O2 is the Best.No Doubts,2
good company wouldn't use any other network,2
have been using for 15 years or more now and i love the service website is so easy to use and check everything u need to u can even swap and change anything u want to with out having to spend hours on the phone. im the only one outta all my mates on 02 and im the only one who has signal every where i go. will continue to use this service for another 15+ i love it :),2
"They are offering good broadband service and have excellent uptime. Prices are affordable, recommended.",2
I have been with O2 since te days of btcellnet and I would have to have an extremely good reason to look elsewhere.,2
"I have a Pay as you Go account. I use my mobile about twice a year. I do not have to top up unless I have used up my time. O2 have never pressured me to change my useage. I use their service sparingly, it has always worked first time, and they leave me alone to get on with it. I could not wish for more.Update on 26 09 2014 ... two and a half years later.The service is still reliable and the rules are still the same. In concrete terms, when I've bought does not disappear on the basis of arbitrary time limit. I still pay only for what I use.",2
Not the best with techno. And help is always on hand.  Give them a bell and they sort me out.,2
"I've been with o2 for i dont know how long. Haven't ever had any probs with them whatsoever.The staff in their shops are so very helpfull, polite & never try and push you to take the dearest contract or pay as you go phone.You tell them what you want and they sort you out, end of.Brill, Brill, Brill!!!",2
never without a network and some good offers,2
"Helpful staff, set up phone, helped me decide on best mobile for me",2
Love 02 as that is who I am with & I would never go with any one els.,2
"Always connected and really good value. Im pay as you go but with monthly contract, the main thing is there have been no hidden surprises. Ill stay with O2 as long as they dont change too much.",2
ANY PROBLEMS ARE SORTED OUT WITH THE MINIMAL OF FUSS. GREAT RECEPTION,2
Not too many offers of free texts I never use!,2
excellent coverage in north east. fair price bands,2
"O2 have served me very nicely, they answer my questions and are always polite and friendly, as is their Live Chat.The reception is great on my mobile, their Broadband is reliable and hard to beat.",2
I have been a happy customer with O2 for 7 years......they have a package to suit every pocket,2
"Had pay as you go and contract phones with O2 and never any problems. Even when I decided to switch to Vodafone, but switched back again cos no signal at home!I have 2 contracts running at present and the local O2 shop staff are excellent! Even ended up getting a cheaper tariff with a different phone than one I originally went in to see about!It's all about customer focus!! Or that is what it feels like and I should know being into quality management!",2
"i have now been an O2 customer for a number of years and once again was surpassed by their customer service and support when my renewal was due, they listened, looked around and once again offered me exactly what i needed at a price i wanted to pay instead of trying to sell me what i didnt need  -  well done O2",2
"I had o2 years ago, then switched to 3 then switched back about a year ago. Signal reliability has been far better and their call centre doesn't seem to be based far overseas like at 3's. Good range of phones in store at a good price. No complaints",2
I have been an o2 customer for over three years and always they have been very supportive with help and information. As my needs have changed they have proved very flexible and always try to find the best deal for me. Their network coverage is good and I always have confidence in them. I am a great believer in companies that provide good value and good service and o2 tick all the boxes!,2
easy to contact all call's to them in the Ukweb site fast and simple,2
"The price for broadband for being an O2 mobile customer is amazing. I'm a heavy user of the broadband, using lots of bandwidth with no complaints from them. Speed stays consistent, never have any problem streaming Full HD movies on the XBox.Never experienced any billing problems and customer services are always helpful and friendly.",2
"All my family use a O2 mobile chip and I`ve tried another mobiles network but for me the best one till today is O2 Network, better mobile internet and calls from anywhere, just the best in my opinion.",2
Good prices & service but when calling customer service I get different answers each time I speak to a different operator.,2
Have used O2 via my Tesco phone for some years now.  Reliable service and good signal in most places.  Very satisfied.,2
very pleased with the service never had a problem in 7 years thanks o2,2
Ive been with O2 for several years & have never had any kind of problem. Recently got a iPhone & Blackberry from O2 so was transferring numbers/sim's and they done it all for me! Honest customer service & best of all UK Call centers unlike other networks! People have had problems with O2's delivery courier YODEL and YODEL have the worst reviews for delivering but Ive never had any kind of problem with them delivering my 2 phones. 5/5 FOR O2!,2
"I have been with O2 as a mobile phone service provider for well over a decade!  I have switched between different tariffs and services with ease, taking best advantage of what is available at the time.  The service is so good that you can have it and forget about it!  Billing is clear and easy and the signal is superb!  The deals are pretty good too.",2
I ordered a new phone at 5pm and it was delivered by 12 the next day. Couldn't ask for better service than that,2
After 10 years with another company O2 have proved to be an excellent alternative. I was offered as fancy or as basic as appropriate and am very pleased so far after 2 months,2
I've been with O2 since 2005 and have never had any problems with them. The network is great and never fails. All of my family are with O2 and connecting is so easy. I also like the number of tariffs available. Excellent!,2
"Pretty much 100% uptime on their broadband and never seems to drop in bandwidth. Might be contention ratios but it's a very good service and the help line, whenever i have needed it, has friendly and competent employees (with no hard to understand accents....thankgod!)",2
"I purchased a HTC mobile Phone on Contract and i have always been pleased with the help given to me regarding the initial purchase and the customer care help team are second too none, they are knowledgeable on there products,helpful and polite at all times.I would not use any other provider.",2
Been with O2 for years and as you would expect it's not been a trouble-free period of time. But they step up to the plate and resolve issues perfectly in my opinion.,2
Just to say thank you for your amazing telephone customer service :),2
Excellent coverage tariffs and after sales service,2
"I switched to O2 just over a year ago having been (unfortunately) an Orange customer fo years. The difference in customer service simply amazed me, on my first bill they overcharged me by not removing a bolt on, the customer service immediately corrected it, apologised and put a credit on my account as a goodwill gesture. I have never had a billing problem since, and the customer services provided and cost are excellent. I will definitely stick with o2 for the forseeable future!",2
"I use simplicity and have done for about four years now, love that 02 to 02 if free - i also pay £10 per month extra for international calls - i get three numbers and can ring family members with nothing else to pay other than the £10 - brill - i also get a spanish number included in this so my family can ring me (its diverted straight to my mobile) and only pay local ratesIf you have family abroad I would highly recommend this service",2
"My work phone is on Vodafone and my personal phone is O2. My personal phone is always in signal and never drops out of range. I always struggle with Vodafone to get a signal, even when I am in London.",2
Been with O2 for the past 5 years and they havent let me down. Great service/reception and customer care. I recommend O2.,2
I have a monthly account and a pay as you go one they are both very good value for money,2
I have never had any issues regarding the O2 network. I have managed to constantly get signal wherever I go for phonecalls/texts and mobile internet.,2
"They're just great. Excellent customer service, good tariffs and nice little touches like the rewards. I'll probably never switch to anyone else.",2
"I have been an O2 customer for over 13 years and have always been satisfied with their service, contracts and deals. In a world of sharks that are the other telecommunications companies O2 is second to none.",2
"but o2 must give prepaying customers treats too, quite pricey if you dont get the right deal.",2
"I bought my first iphone, however I did the whole thing on the web, maybe I could have got a better deal over the phone as I have been with O2 over 2 years.........However I cannot fault the service and the web site to monitor my account is very good compared to their competition. Delivery of phone was very fast. I am thinking of moving my home broadband to O2 soon, also may move my wifes contract to O2.",2
This is the best signal in most areas in paignton tried the other networks but this is by far the best,2
"I have been with o2 mobile for over 2 years now, so they were able to offer me by far the most reasonably priced broadband package.In the first week I had issues with the speed so I called there customer services and what a pleasant surprise!! UK based call centres every time, and so helpful, the agents were able to guide me through the settings and resolve my speed issues, I now have super-fast, super-cheap broadband! Thanks",2
"I joined BT Genie a worrying number of years ago and when it became part of 02 so did I. Since then I have had many years of good service and helpful support from this company and I have just signed up for another contract with which I had a good price on an iphone 4s.  Their website and on-line service are great and their customer service and sales team are informed and helpful. Best of all they haven't dodged billions in tax.  I would recommend 02 to anyone because of all the horror stories I have heard from friends using other phone companies - you don't get that with 02.  I have had 15 years of honest, reliable, good quality service and that must surely be almost unheard of in this sector.",2
"After having the misfortune of go over to 3. I am please to be back with O2. Their customer service Team is top Notch and welcomed me back, they did not try and sell me something that I did not want and they listened to me, I love the fact that I spoke to a local person,",2
"THIS SITE IS A WINNER ,O2 SITE IS SO EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR . 100% WINNER WITH ME .JASON",2
"I have been with most (or all) of the major mobile service providers.  O2 have a way of making me feel special, by proactively informing me of benefits I may be interested in.Example:  I received a call as an iPhone4 user in advance of the iPhone4S release to see if I wanted one on the release date.  Very considerate.  And it was a local  UK call centre and they knew a lot about my usage.Good work O2!  Now about those excessive;ly high roaming charges...",2
Ive had a contract with o2 now for about 18 months. Can fault them at all. Great copmpany,2
"very helpful, good value been with them for over 14 years mever had a problem",2
I have been with o2 now for a good few years and I have never had a problem with them. The customer advisor Ash in the Kettering store in Northamtponshire is always helpful and nothing is ever to much trouble for him. Keep up the good work o2.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 12 years. I have always enjoyed the best customer service, some great deals and total efficiency when occasionally things have gone wrong. I just love 02!",2
"Been with vodafone and tescos, o2 are always very very helpful and responsive",2
"Excellent choice of tariffs, they could use updating though as some other porviders have even better deals for new customers however, O2 will not be beaten on deals for loyal customers! Been with them 4years not a single problem!",2
"I find my experience with O2 just amazing. They  have the best prices and the best customer service ever. I had a problem with the landline and they refunded me the difference for the phone calls i couldn't make. My bandwidth was low once and an engineer spent hours with me on the phone trying to understand where the problem was and finally he found it!! I've been a customer for years and called them many times, they are always helpful and always very kind in every single phone call i made. A rarity in these days.",2
Been with various phone companies but O2 is one of the best ive been with deals are very good and its very cheap. Would recommend.,2
Have been with the company on contract for 13 years (in various forms) and have never had a problem,2
"been using 02 for 10years now, wouldnt use another service, I hope they continue to be the best, they have affordable packages for everyone, I have continual service whereever I go, 02 for life.",2
"Always great service, no problems with bills and upgrades are always delivered on time. I have been using them for about 16 years (Was BT/Cellnet before)",2
"Recently left Sky for O2 with regards phone and broadband, the service up to now has been first class. I am already a customer of O2 with mobile contract of many years",2
JUST MOVED TO 02 FROM ORANGE MUCH BETTER SIGNAL,2
No matter where I am o2 does deliver.,2
"I am an 02 pay as you go customer and have been for years. It's great because if you top up £15 a month you get unlimited calls and text to other 02 customers and everyone I know is on 02, plus you still get to keep you £15 credit. Also every 3 months 02 give 10% of your top up back which is another bonus. Great network to be with.",2
"Treated like an adault. And not a fool, good company, good deals, and offers that are all usefull. Unlike other company's with gimicky rubish.",2
better than the rest... at least for me....,2
"Great service, Great communications No hassels",2
i love 02 because if you dont top up for a bit you will get sone money free..,2
Always have used this service. Good for your money.,2
always good service from this company. still want to get my hands on a new iphone 4 s though!,2
Never had 1 single issue.I am an o2 gold customer and love that I get upgrades early,2
Superb service always in signal and helpful customer care,2
"Great coverage, excellent handset choice, competitive costs and ~ Priority Tickets!I was so impressed as a private individual that I switched my company business to O2.",2
best deals no matter what always got some new scheme or deal,2
Have been with O2 for over 10 years have had loads of other companies try to take make me swap.  Not interested i have alway found the customer service to be second to none. So I will be staying put,2
"I've been a customer of o2 for quite some time, and I must say I'm impressed.To start with, I find that they have a nice reliable network. I can usually get a good signal about 90% of the time. The 10% is probably out of town, in rural areas. As for 3G, this has improved a lot in my area, which is due to more masts being installed by them. Again, 3G coverage is very patchy in rural areas.I've never had a call dropped, and have I probably only missed about 1% of any messages that I've been expecting.I guess their mobile data lets them down a little, but to be honest, I don't use it that much so I can't really rate them down for it. It would be better if it was cheaper, and had more of an allowance, but it seems to work reasonably well for me when I do ocassionally connect.Support has been great too. Whenever I've needed to contact them, It's always been a quick, and pleasant experience. They seem to know what they are doing, and get it done for you.What I love the most is the loyalty to their existing customers, along with the rewards for their new customers. They are always coming up with new and exciting schemes to reward it's members, all of which benefit me. If I left their network, I'd miss those.",2
"I have been with o2 for many years (after a brief and silly fling with another network, but we don't talk about that period).Recently I decided that I wanted to purchase a blackberry, but on Pay As You Go.I have found that o2's blackberry sim is absolutly fantastic. I top up my £15 pounds a month and then I get Blackberry Services, 500Mb AND 500 texts, all COMPLETELY FREE!!!!Then, when I had a problem setting it up, I went on to their website, and a friendly guy popped up and started chatting to me about how to fix the issues! It was quick, easy, and I didn't have to spend forever on hold whilst paying a fortune on my phone call.O2, I will NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN, and I'm still really sorry about that incident where I did for 2 months. It was a mistake. Forgive me?",2
"I am and have been an O2 customer for the last 8 years.I have Mobile Contracts, Home Phone & Broadband subscriptions with them and have yet to be disappointed.The Broadband is as advertised (my area doesn't get great speeds - but they accurately informed me of the speeds I would get - thus managing my expectations) and their Home Phone service is great value for money.Their mobile contracts are similarly good - and in many cases beat their competitors hands down.They offer a £5 per month discount on their Home Phone & Broadband contracts for O2 Mobile customers and always ensure that existing customers are offered the same great deals and new ones - whether that be 1/2 price broadband for six months or exclusive mobile contracts.A very, very happy customer! I hope O2 continue to put such an emphasis on great customer service and value for money.",2
"I'm very happy with O2. When my house was burgled, they were extremely helpful, and within 48 hours, I had a brand new phone, same number, minimum disruption. I rely a lot on my smartphone for business, so I was very happy. Since then, the service has been great, and the signal is very strong wherever I go, luckily.",2
"I wouldnt go with any other network,o2 is the best for everything, they are second to none and i would recomend them to everyone.Happy customerXx Cat xX",2
I have been with O2 for many years and find the company trustworthy fair and customer friendly,2
Very helpful company with 24/7/365 free to call UK Customer Service.Brilliant for Broadband also.  Have never had a problem with signal reception.,2
I am on Orange wife is on O2 she is happy I am very unhappy .....says it all,2
"on the ball every time with good service nothings to much trouble , i even phoned up on a sat phone to get more credit and they where very quick to deal with me when i told them how much it was costing",2
I stupidly went to orange last year after over ten years with o2. After a nightmare time with orange and their customer service (that should be lack of it) feel like i'm back home,2
"I have been with 02 for years,since they were BT CELLNET and i would never go with anyone else.Their website is first class and they are constantly updating & trying to improve it by asking their customers what they think.You can actually see the feedback they receive being implemented into the upgrades,its very good.TOP MARKS FOR 02,I WOULD NEVER CHANGE SERVICE PROVIDER.",2
This is a must for people with smart phones especially iphone users. I bought my iphone from apple and ordered an O2 Simplicty tarrif. The sim came within 2 days and was activated straight away. This is by far a superior service to any other mobile provider. Highly Recommnded,2
My phone is from tesco and they share the network with o2. It's great as i get a signal everywhere and my mates who are on orange don't!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
have used them for the last 2 years and have been very happy.  My latest HTC is great,2
"Four years I have tormented O2 with my Phone contracts, each time I manage to confuse them, do they care? You bet they do they always get me back straight and the customer service is brilliant, as is their O2 Phoneshops.",2
Good response and backup from customer care,2
"Got next day delivery on my upgrade.  I always recieve a friendly, fast and efficient service.  I have been with O2 for 5 years and I wouldn't use another company.",2
...avoid the on-line gurus that take an age to respond to your questions. I actually thought it may have been a computer program as their responses were so slow. I asked to speak to their supervisor and that wasn't much better!However I have been with )2 for over 10 years and this is the only complaint I have!Still 5 stars for me!!,2
I have been with o2 for years and have nothing but good feelings towards them!i have recently had to deal with the customer service dept ( a few probs i have had with my broadband and home line) They were very helpful and sorted my problems out straight away!.I would definiately reccomend them to anyone.Especially the broadband and home phone line package (you get a £5 off each month if you have a mobile with them!),2
"i have been with 02 for years, its never let me down and they are always very helpful and polite if i have ever needed to call them. i`ve never had a problem with 02 in the past and i love the 02 surprises you get when you topup i look forward to many more happy years with them.",2
"I have been with O2 for around 5 years now, their service is second to none, and their service team is always so helpful",2
Love o2.I top up £15 a month and get free calls and texts to other o2 users  which is great as loads of people I know are on o2.So you still have your £15 to call landlines and othe networks.,2
"I've been with o2 for years, it's very rare that I can't get a signal on my phone. In fact, I was once 3000ft up the Schiehallion mountain in highland Scotland, and my phone rang... the reception was as clear as a bell.I've had their broadband for 2 years, and it stopped working once. I switched the router off then on again, and away it went.I'm constsntly listening to people at work moaning about their providers, I'm glad I stuck with O2.",2
No problems great reception. Very helpful staff,2
"I am on the O2 Simplicity 300 tarif and they have never let me down. I also get unlimited data for £7/month and have never had a problem with this.The support staff are good, and have reduced the ammount i have to pay a couple of times whilst still getting the same deal on minuites and texts.I also get free O2 to O2 calls, so me and my girlfriend are very happy :-)",2
"Im on a plan that I get unlimited texts and 100 mins on a rolling monthly contract of £10but give them a ring if you are on pay as you or contract go and just talk to some one there to sort out some bolt-ons or change the contract to what you actually want this is the best way to get a good deal.good way to get the best out of ur contract is to say that another company is offering 'xxx mins and unlimited texts  for the same price as im paying now for half as many minuets and 300 texts'. use other companies deals to your advantage they will normally match them.They may offer ;Extra texts ,mins or internet1 min = 1 textmaybe extra texts or internet for loyalycheaper tariffsThey have room to negotiate just be nice :D",2
"Been an O2 customer for many many years and never been let down once. If there was a problem, it was easy to fix. Great customer support in both online and offline.",2
Always so helpful and sort out the problems straight away.,2
"As a customer for over 10 years, I must say that O2 are certainly consistent in their good customer relations.  Their deals are among the best out there too.",2
I have been with 02 for a number of years now and have never had a problem with them ever. I love the customer service as they are so helpful and always try to make sure your query is dealt with and that you as the customer is happy.I have not just a contract mobile phone with them but also their home broadband and home telephone and I can say I have never had any problems with any of them. The fact that they seem to get good network coverage is a huge bonus and the prices are excellent for the broadband and home phone line a little bit pricey for contract tariffs but with the network coverage and customer service I can't complain.Keep it up 02 an excellent job.,2
"o2 stands out from the crowd, as one of the first company to start getting things right. I have my mobile, land line & broadband with them.I am not a heavy user, so I don't make lots of calls or text messages. But I get screwed on hand set prices when ever I upgrade.",2
"i have been an o2 customer for almost 3 years now and they keep surprising me positively over and over. being nothing more than a humble pay and go customer, i am well happy with the amounts of great offers and tarifs being thrown at me almost constantly. none of the other prividers takes such good care of those who are not yet willing to go for a contract offer. and i really love the top up surprises!",2
Great for using in UK and even abroad. Has been with me many years. Love it. :),2
"Excellent service, good deals, great signal (most of the time) what more can you ask for?",2
Thank you O2 for helping with my new mobile phone purchase.Your help was greatly appreciated.,2
"I have been with O2 for years and have never experienced any problems with the provider. I would rate their customer services as good. On one occassion I had a problem with a smartphone I had purchased from somewhere else, O2 were still happy to help and did their best to resolve the issue. Although I never swear allegiance to them (I always look for the best deal even if it means switching providers, I'm with Orange at the moment!), they are better than some of the providers out there.",2
"I find in the southeast o2 is the only network that works in all areas, with no nosense. Better than any of my friends and their phones.",2
"Have been with 02 for 4 years, great reception in most areas.",2
I have used O2 Home BB for 2-3 years now and find their serice to be impeccable. Really excellent service and well recommended.,2
O2's services is superb I recently upgraded my wife and son to Blackberrys the transition could not have been better. Thank you O2.,2
I travell all over the world and have never had a problem with this network. Have been with them for years.,2
"Always have been with o2 and find their customer service, rewards and incentives great. Love that advisors make sure your pay and go tarrifs suit the customer not their income. Will always recommend them to friends and family and customers that I deal with on a day to day basis as a sales advisor. Good job to the company and the staff, rare thing to come by these days.",2
"02 the network that always has a good signal, and if you do get a problem their customer service is second to none",2
"Been with them for 8 years and have never had a problem with them. Upgrades good, customer service brilliant. Polite and professional.",2
"what's not to like, you get a free email account & 200 free webtexts a month, it's really good value for money",2
I've been a O2 customer for over 8 years now and I've never had a problem. Would recommend to anyone.,2
great funky company that does the sale thing but with decorum!,2
"The most generous mobile network with all sorts of extras for free - Treats, Surprises, Rewards.  You also get all sorts of allowances as well as retaining your top-up credit and can choose from a  huge range of Bolt-Ons.  I've been with O2 for about 8 years and will never change!",2
Ive been on o2 for as long as i can remember and it has just got better and better providing me with personalised rewards and chances to win things.,2
Been with them for years.We use Orange and Vodafone at work and sometimes struggle with reception.I never do with O2.,2
Never had a problem with that company!!!,2
"My first ever mobile phone was on O2 and I'm still with them now £$%& years later!  With the rewards system, the bolt on options and the generally excellent signal coverage I've never felt the need to go anywhere else.  Not often you can say that in this day and age, but I am and always have been happy with my mobile phone provider.",2
"Been using O2 for business mobile for 5 years. Excellent coverage, easy to use website, reasonable prices, good service and nice upgrade options.",2
Excellent customer service! I swear by O2.,2
"smashing network, love the rewards wouldnt swop for any other network well satisfied.",2
"always look to find the best deal to suit your needs, never oversold a product",2
love the free text and mins 02 to 02,2
I deal predominantly with the Ormskirk branch and they are always helpful and offer a high level of customer service.,2
"I've been with o2 for a very long time - never had any major problems, and even with the little things customer service is always a pleasure to deal with and sort problems out quickly and efficiently.",2
I have been on O2 for 5 years and I have always found them to give excellent service.,2
i have  got o2 since i came here in the UK.My cousins got other networks and when i compare prices and network coverage its good man,2
Love o2 always have and will never change my network,2
"Simple... I like loyalty and reward it in life. So, when my phone went on the blink last year and I was two months from the end of my contract (usually spending £200 a month!) I hoped T-mobile would do the usual and offer an early upgrade. Amazingly, they took a hard line and sad a flat NO! Even though I have held my account with them since it was one2one in 1996!So, once my contract, my mobile broadband, my personal mobile phone, my wifes phone and car phone were up for renewal I moved the lot to O2. Better customer service, cheaper, better signal at work and home and I have been offered early upgrades - for being a LOYAL customer. Well done O2!",2
Initially I went through Carphone Warehouse & never had substantial connection issues & the price plan was reasonable.  They also supplied my a very reliable handset.  I have been very pleased.  I have just recently changed my contract/price plan to match my current employment.  I am dealing with O2 direct & so far I have found them very easy & convenient to deal with.  I have been a customer for about 4 yrs.,2
I have been with O2 for quite a while now. My wife also has a phone with them. We have had excellent service and will continue to use them for the foreseeable future. Their tariffs are fair and the optional bolt-ons are a brilliant idea.,2
All the family are on contract with 02.  There customer service is excellent and they are always very helpful and efficient.,2
The best network by a mile was with 3 mobile never ever go with them maybe cheap but you will never get a signal.,2
I get great signal and text messages allowing me to book tickets early at events happening at the o2. Need i say more?,2
"I had my phone stolen recently and as soon as it was reported to O2 they acted right away, and couriered a replacement handset to me the very next morning. By comparison with my normal contents insurance - it took me weeks to sort out a replacement laptop.",2
never any problems but if there was they soon sort it,2
had no problems with this sevice provider whatsoever.,2
"I never get any problems with O2. Always manage to get a signal, no delays sending messages, no problems with billing.Always get excellent service with polite and knowledgeable staff at call centre.",2
excellent network give you lots of free things back unlike any other network,2
I am at the moment enjoying my 4th year with O2 iphone contract as well as 2 year ISP contract.  great job O2 keep it up.,2
I have three phones all with o2....all three smartphones of different types. One purchased over the counter..and two online.Online account with the ability to 'join' all of the accounts and manage the phones is excellent and easy to use.Real level of expertise in the shop (Worcester).Never had any problems with connection or the phones supplied.I've upgraded two of the phones online at the end of contracts with no problems at all and fast delivery on the new handsets.No hesitation in recommending.,2
Never had any problems first class service,2
"I've tried Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile and left them all due to poor service, both customer and phone reception. I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, I have my mobile, landline and broadband with them. Their customer service is second to none, they don't charge an extortionate amount for contacting them either should you need to (which in my case is rarely). I cannot recommend O2 highly enough and no I don't work for them, just one incredibly satisfied customer.....rare in this day and age I know.",2
i've been with o2 for over 10 years and never had any problems customer service is always 10/10,2
Good service they offer and great customer service too,2
Good reception n very good customer service.May be the price is slightly higher then other networks but standard is too good.,2
"Always great signal wherever I go, no point having a mobile if yr running around trying to get connected",2
after a terrible year with the three network in ireland i changed back to o2 got a free phone and double top ups for a year great customer support far better than 3's miserable attempt from some call center india where i couldnt understand anyone and got no where,2
We use O2 for our mobiles and home broadband. We have contacted their customer service via phone for both mobile and broadband queries and each time they have answered our questions succinctly and clearly. They have been friendly and polite. Similarly when we visit their stores the service provided has been great. We usually visit the store at Fulham Broadway. All the staff are friendly and helpful and we leave satisfied. Sometimes the process of changing plans can take a little while however it does not worry us as the staff are friendly and have a chat with us so the time goes really quickly. We are seated and offered a glass of water so we are made to feel comfortable. It is not like our experiences with some other organisations where you can't wait to leave the store. Thanks O2.,2
"have myself, my husband, and my daughter on o2 network!",2

Been with O2 since they started and have always had good service from them and their network.,2
"No hassle straight friendly service which deserves loyalty. I am treated as a person, not a customer. After serveral new phones, contract renewals and general enquiries, each time I have left the O2 shop (Ipswich) feeling happy with the service I have received. Well done, keep it up.",2
ive been with 02 some years and always found thier customer care second to none and also have great service and they constantly looking for ways to keep ur tariff to suit u and save u money.,2

A special mention for their Customer Service team.....Any time I had problems, customer services would walk me through it, not in a hurry to get off the phone like other companies!!! It felt like they WANTED to help me and sort me out.Also very good prices!!",2
i have been with o2 for many years now and have never had a problem once,2
"Since being a member of O2 3 years ago, i have never had an issue with their service. This being mobile network service and also the customer service teams. They are always super friendly and more than willing to help. It actually reminds me of the Apple customer service which is renowned as being excellant.Another great thing i have to take my hat off to O2 for is when the iPhone 4 was launched. I waited in the massive que to get my much anticipated iphone 4. They made sure i got one without a hitch. To add to the excitement they were handing out free cakes and newspapers to people queuing which i thought was a great touch.Happy to be an O2 customer and reccomend to anyone.",2

good network coverage and low prices without any problems ever,2
I posted my phone off and the money was credited to my account the next day.,2
I have been with O2 for several years and have had nothing but excellent service for all the years I've been a customer of theirs. The reception and signal are great and the coverage across the UK is good too.,2
probably theis most helpful bunch of folk you wish to mdeal with,2
Proffesional company with their customers always in mind.,2
Always found O2 to have a network and coverage better than the competitors. Would not use any other now,2
"Fantastic.  I have been with them since I owned my first Mobile phone, would not change.",2
"I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, having previously been with Orange and Vodafone. I find O2 offer great customer service (on the few times I've had to call)I use the PAYG sim in an iphone, so for £15pm I get unlitimed text, unlimited internet and a good few minutes. I also get the 'Surprises' which are not amazing but certainly add a bit of fun to things.No plans to change anytime in the near future",2
"i have had a few pay as you go mobiles from o2 and have had brilliant service and coverage each time. i have also had a pay as you go mobile from orange and a contract from three, niether of those were any good compared to o2. tesco mobile is good but then it uses o2 so it would be. i have now got a contract with o2 and i have had no problems at all ive always got a signal, the phone is a samsung wave but is cheap as i have free minutes and texts and 500mb of free downloads. there customer service is the best ive ever dealt with too!",2
from start to finish about six days.very pleased with this company,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years... they have always given me a great service. Very helpful advice in relation to my bill, contract and upgrades. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",2
"I've been a customer and user of O2 for nearly a decade now and wouldn't ever think of changing to another company. Really can't fault them. Why people even bother to go to their competitors is beyond me - especially with O2's advantage over Orange in that they aren't founded on Evil, or the malice and corruption of Vodaphone and T Mobile.Plus, since they took over the old Cellnet transmitters it means that O2 have consistently the best coverage of anyone.",2
"Have been with o2 for almost 7 years and never had any bother with service, Any queries and or questions dealt with quickly and professionally. Easy to use web site with easy to read and simple to follow instructions.",2
"I've been with 02 for many years and have switched providers on many occasions if i've bought a new phone with a different providers sim card. I find that 02 have the best tariffs for me, i text and use the internet a lot but don't really make calls, i had the 500 texts and 500mb of net for £15 a month but that wasn't enough texts for me so i changed to unlimited texts to 02 as everyone i know is on 02 and when i top up £15 i get the benefit of free calls to 02 although i don't use them, i have bought a bolt on so i get 500mb of net a month for £7.50 so for my £15 a month i get internet and unlimited texts.I love how on 02s website they have the option to live chat with an advisor, that way you don't need to make expensive phone calls or wait days on a reply to an email that might not answer your question fully.I have one complaint and that was i ordered a mobile phone and it never came on the allocated day, i got in touch and i was lied to, i asked to cancel when it never arrived and i was told there was no way i could cancel even though i have full rights to cancel. It finally came 1 month after ordering, was peeved off that they lied to me on more than one occasion about the delivery instead of being straight forward.",2
"Great deals, particularly for pay as you go customers.Hardly any network problems. Friendly staff.",2
i have always been on o2 until recently and seriously regret coming off because out off all the networks o2 defiantly has the great coverage the only problem is it is the most pricey of them all.,2
"ive tried most networks but o2 is by far the best good network great freebies , also very helpfull customer service",2
"With O2 i have never had a problem i ordered my pay monthly phone ages ago, i prefer contract savnig having to keep a eye on your credit all the time, and i never get sneaky bills added on, you get great offers from o2 like o2 arena stuff, i rare lose signal compare to orange and voda who mates of mine lose it quite alot. Be a customer of them for 5 years now, cant go wrong really :D",2
"helpful, thoughful and considerate anwers to elphone inquiries",2
i can recommend this company to friends.,2
"Having transferred from another company I find O2 to be a better company throughout. They were speedy with delivery, accurate with the bills and are very friendly to deal with.",2
"O2 represents, in my eye, the best value for money, coverage, customer service and perks/rewards of any of the big network providers. I have had some very bad experiences with other providers and I am pleased to say that ,as a current customer of both O2 mobile and broadband, I have not a single complaint to make about the superior service",2
The customer service at O2 Stroud was brilliant.  Thanks to Donna for her efficient and friendly manner. Would recommend her and O2 Stroud to anyone,2
"Easy to deal with, never a problem with connection and loads of different offers and SURPRISES.",2
"I've been with O2 god knows how many years, it's the best for service and in my opinion always has been, my friends are always moaning about Orange or T mobile (now one of the same), as for any others its the same story.They just do not compare to O2.",2
"I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 3 recently and spoke to the Business team (I'm a business customer).The service person i spoke to was very helpful, explained all the tariffs and helped me decide which would be most suitable for my needs.I ordered the iPhone 4 16GB and it was with me the next day, followed by a new sim card and letters explaining the contracts, tariffs etc.Really easy to talk to and they explained everything.Will definitely be upgrading with O2 again",2
Haven't encountered any problems with O2 and I've been with them for many years now.,2
Fantastic customer service.  Ordered a new phone at 3pm and arrived the next morning at 9am.,2
"Had o2 18 month contract, no problems but did find insurance expensive & waste of time to be honest. (£7.50 pm for samsung Tocco Ultra) When phone did break I was told although it was 17 months old it would be covered for repair so didn't have to go through insurance. Other than that, always had good signal & no other complaints",2
After 4 different mobiles and three insurance claims which were dealt with within twenty four hours I can think of nothing but praise for O2.,2
"i used 02 for years, find them brilliant",2
"ALWAYS READY TO HELP ,GREAT TARRIFS AND SERVICE ALSO COVERAGE IS VERY GOOD",2
"always a great service and they listen to my concerns if I ever need to contact customer services and that is why I have been with them since the days of cellnet, BT Cellnet, MM02 and now 02",2
the offers that 02 prvide are amazing.,2

Any problems have always been dealt with very well and by people who can understand me and I can understand them.  Never had a mysterious lost call when calling customer service.  Signal stength and quality is great for the rural area that I stay in.,2

"i love o2 they give the best deals that they can, they always have happy to help employers and always talk to you as if they know you and they want to not as if its their job and they have to.",2
"GREAT SERVICE NEVER HAD PROBLEM, BEEN WITH THEN FOR AGES. NEED HELP JUST CALL ASK,",2
Very good offers for everybody and for every need!!!,2
I have been with O2 for years now and always found the service excellent. My previous network were really starting to annoy me - it took four phone calls to get them to do a simple change of address!No problems like that with O2 though - good mobile reception and always great service.,2
"I have never had any problems with my O2 account, unlike several other mobile networks.",2
o2 is a good company never had any problem with there service,2
Been with O2 on a corporate account for 6+ years and price is good and have not had a problem with coverage.,2
"great prices, lots of freebies,thanks this service is excellent",2

Write why you found the experience excellent. For instance:The item arrived the day after I ordered it! The customer service was very helpful and I got all the information that I needed. I can only recommend this company to others. Excellent service and fast delivery.,2
what more can you say unlimited text and free o2 to o2 calls for £15 a month plus some minutes better than most contracts,2
"O2 I have been with 7 years, They find me something that meets my needs and are very  efficient.l",2
I have been on O2 now for years and have tried at least 2 of the other big networks and still find O2 as the best. Their bolt ons are superb and their rates are great too. I would never leave this network.,2
"What a fantastic company, always helpful and im never without reception",2
i luv o2 an i have my whole family with them which is great as we dont pay to call each other or text. i fink they offer the best deals on the market too,2

Was with another Network and could not get reception  in certain areas but with O2 we dont have any problems ... and we gat a good deal :),2
"Its a good service and the discounted home broadband is very good. Also, I love hooking ducks :P",2
Not with them now but was for 5 years and found them to have excellent coverage wherever i was in the Countrywith Orange now (long story) but their cover is terrible,2
"Excellent reception everywhere in UK, great prices on pay as you go.",2
Staff in shop and online always there to help,2
Been with the company for over 10 years now and I havent had a single problem with O2. Whenever I have had a problem with my phone or tariff they have sorted it out straight away and even compensated me,2
Sometimes takes a little while to get what you want but generally the service is good,2
this is the best mobile network provider which has reception almost everywhere in northern ireland fantastic,2
I have been with o2 for 8 years and have always had excellent service for my  money.  I get a strong signal almost everywhere in the country and especially in Derbyshire my home county.  I use their broadband and home phone service as well as mobile.  I have used several others for broadband and o2 give the fastest uninterrupted service.  I would recommend an o2 contract to anyone.,2
Simply excellent Service. & good support when there are problems,2
"I changed from T-Mobile to O2 because of the poor reception I received from T-Mobile living on the coast, this despite their assurances coverage would be good. To add insult to injury, providing a poor service still cost me hundreds of pounds to get out of my contract. It's about time the law was changed to protect the customer and not the phone company. O2, no problems with coverage and service.",2
"Out of all mobile suppliers, O2 signal is the best",2
"Never had any problems getting a reception whereever I am excellent service and good pricing, Love it",2
I have used O2 for a few years and find them very good to deal with and do what they say they are going to do.  No problems so far!,2

WhenI have had problems with the network they have been sorted out promptly.,2
"consistantly good reception in all areas ,the best of all the providers.",2
Been with 02 since 1989 when it was known as cellnet. Never had a problem with the service.,2
"great communication, my bills never have any unexpected charges !! all in all great service !!",2
Always get good signal everywhere and if I have had problems with my phone they have always been delt with promptly. Recently sent Phone to be repaired was back within 1 week. People at O2 who I've spoken to over the phone have always been helpful.,2
I've got a couple of accounts with O2 but with Blackberry handsets.Offered the best deals I could find and service has been first rate.  Dealt with their customer services a few time when looking to upgrade handsets/review accounts and service was first rate.,2
"always have signal, look after existing customers, brill bonus's and extras plus you get priority tickets for gigs!",2
"Best all round network, no hassle good coverage at a whole",2
Was treated as a valued customer not a money making opportunity.,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years and have always found the service and coverage the best.  With the Smart phones I have experienced some problems but these have always been resolved with one phone call, including 24 hour replacement on two occasions.  When talking to Tech Support they have always striven to solve the problem straight away after showing patience and understanding.  Could not ask for anything more.  Support within O2 shops have been first rate also.",2
i have had work phones on other networks that have lost signal and i check my personnal phone only to find i have signal and had had to use my phone to contact my employer. Will never change from o2 its the best,2

"never had a problem with either, highly recommended.",2
"been with O2 for many years now, always been satisfied with service, and offers",2

I am a novice on mobile phones and needed help and 02 were extremely helpful sorting out and directing me to where I needed to go on their site. Thank you. V. Wells,2
ive had all network over the years and o2 seem to be the best in this area for me,2
On pay as you go.Never had any problems.Excellent,2
We always get a good quality signal unlike other companies that we have tried.When I have needed a repair to my phone it has always been done quickly.,2
"I have been with O2 for many years now, the coverage is exceptional, works wherever I am in the country, they always find the best deal for me, simply have no complaints!",2
"I have been with 02 for years and cannot get a better deal anywhere else.  Any problems I have had have been dealt with by customer services in a professional manner and I have a few products with them.  They most certainly reward loyalty and I love the whole service, package etc I have with them.",2
"have been on o2 since 2003 and would not change for the world, best deals for me, perfect phones and the customer service from o2 is brillient and helpfull.",2
"I have moved my mobile phone and mobile internet to 02 as they are a better company in my opinion. I have tried other networks and i am fed up of them phoning me up at home and on my mobile, they just wont leave me alone. 02 has let me choose what i want to do, what i want to pay, and if i want any help they are there for me on line or in the shops.So thank you 02 for keeping me sane.",2
They have online help guides as well as people online to talk to you about your problems. Have had nothing but good experiences with O2,2
"I have been a customer of o2 for about 6 years and in that time have had no issues with getting service or trying to sort out any questions / problems I have had. Their call centres have always been easy to get through to, and the people at the other end always seem to be helpful.I had a problem with a phone I took when I upgraded back in february, the people in the store were quick to swap the faulty phone, and made sure the new unit was working properly for me.The only thing I would think to mention is that in some cases it is difficult to find the information you need on their website, but as I don't need to access it regularly its not something that I find to be too much of a problem.Overall my experience of o2 has been great, and I would recommend the network to anyone looking for a new provider.",2
I haven't had a problem with them. I like the fact that I can manage my account and email them rather than having to call a call center. They usually phone me back when I email too!,2
"Excellent customer services, plans and even better reception",2
always had good fast quality service,2
"left o2 for orange 18 months ago soriest thing i have ever done, came bake to o2 in october, coverage, sales and after sales exelent",2
"I have an HTC Desire Smartphone and I'm on a Simplicity tarriff of £15 a month. I get enough minutes, unlimited texts AND unlimited internet, though I never use that much! Been with them for 14 years and have always received brilliant service (well except once) and will stay with them. Very competitive.",2
I just love this network.  So easy to use and excellent customer services.,2
"I have been with several different networks in the past but I have found O2 to be the best. Signal coverage is fantastic, great deals, and some great ""perks"" as a customer including access to priority tickets for sports events, gigs, and comedy shows. I recently took out a new contract for an iPhone 4 with O2 and the customer service I received whilst purchasing my phone in store was fantastic it was quick, reliable and very helpful.I can definitely say I won't be changing to any other network after being a customer with O2.",2
I've had an O2 Mobile for a number of years now and until recently I have had a 100% service.I have now switched to t-mobile but if I dont get the service I desire then Im switching back.,2
"I've been with O2 for a couple of years now, and always been happy with the mobile phone side of the business.  When renewing my contract recently, not only did I get a great tariff with the Blackberry that I wanted, but they also offered me a home phone and internet package that was a third of the price of my BT package - and with far superior customer service!",2
never have a problem and when i do they are always there and willin to help :),2
I hav always had exceptional service from O2,2
Both provider of mobile contract and line rental/broadband!,2
"I love O2. Not ony do they have excellent coverage, they also offer top price plans for pay and go and pay monthly AND rewards!I have never had a problem with this provider and always reccomend to everybody.",2
"I am very rarely without a mobile signal and calls very rarely drop.Have had 1 or 2 slight probs with my broadband package, but have been told that was BT rather than O2 - so no faults there!",2
Telephone help and support fantastic!Services provided on their mobile network is faultless,2
we are all on O2 and it works really well.,2
"I HAVE BEEN WITH O2 FOR OVER 20 YEARS WHEN MOBILES WHERE LIKE BRICKS, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD GREAT SERVICE CHEAP TARIFFS AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FREE TO CALL AND VERY HELPFUL VERY GOOD NETWORK COVERAGE.",2

",and there pay as you go tariffs are nice.allways have service never any problems",2

"Good customer service, calls answered promptly. I live in a rural area and the provide the best reception in my area.",2
"great free stuff on pay as you go, i get free calls and texts to other o2 numbers as long as i top up £10 & surprises gifts to play to",2
"My work phone was on O2 and personal phone on Orange.  In comparison the reception on Orange is awful, lots of dead spots.",2
its all just so easy talking to staff and the free gifts i have no problems with this service,2
i find O2 to have excellent customer service which is important to me as a consumer.  i have never had any problems trying to connect or not being able to get  signal from wherever i am. their pay as you go plans are easy to follow and value for money but their simplicity card is excellent value. i would definately recomend them,2
"i have had a contract with o2 for nearly 3 years. i get great signal anywhere i go, including spots that may other phone networks struggle with.if i have ever had a problem the customer services have always been friendly, helpull, and easy to get hold off on the free call numberthe arent the cheapest network out there but i think for the service they give the couple extra pounds is definately worth it",2
"I have been a customer of  o2 since July 2009 and have found them to be, helpful, informative (especially online help and e-mail feedback) and in general good value for money. Service wise I have only recently had one problem with my 3G availability with my iphone4  and it was dealt with promptly and efficiently.  I was also offered a £5 credit to my account for the loss of service. To be honest this was far better than my previous suppliers!",2
"They offer simply the best deals for my needs and will also grant you freebies and suprises when you top up, depending on the amount you top-up.not a bad word towards o2 they are awesome! :)note: (been with vodafone, orange, 3 and o2. and o2 is by far the best as i have been with them for 6 years now)",2
Never had any complaints and would reccomend to anyone,2
"very good customer help line, helpful clever suggestions. great signal and amazing tariffs.",2
o2 always does what it says it will. I've never had any problems and would like to think I'll have a pay monthly contract with the company for the foreseeable future.,2
"excellent service from o2.. never had an issue with them, best for serivice and deals..",2
"02 are the best Mobile Network I have ever dealt with, I never had to contact them in the 5 years I was with them & only moved company because I got a better deal.Moving to Vodafone was a big mistake, they are pretty useless, never answer the phone, & rude & always seem to magically over charge me every month.I'll be going back to 02 once my contract is renewed. I'm sorry 02!",2
after contracted to the company for years I still happy with the service,2
I can't really comment too much on o2's customer service because I have never had a problem with the service I receive from the company!! The coverage is great.,2
"IVE BEEN WITH O2 FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS NOW. I WOULDNT LEAVE THEM FOR ANYTHING. DEFINATELY THE BEST NETWORK AROUND... FREE TEXTS, FREE CALLS, SUPRISES... WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR...O2 IS GOD",2
"I've been using o2 for about 10 years on and off, i changed networks in between to try but always came back to O2, good customer services, good offers, good reception.",2

"Great tech service, no hassle, good customer service staff, very helpful",2

beenn with 02 for 12yrs or so and never had a single problem i am getting an iphone4 this week lets hope i have no problems changing to a micro sim meny thanks 02,2
"Friendly and effective customer service makes all the difference when you hit problems or need help.  You really notice it when you move to an operator like 3 who seem to practise customer abuse from their offshore call centre - never again, I'm back with O2 and much the happier for it.  Simplicity contracts are great value too, and network coverage is good. What's not to like?",2
Excellent staff. Good customer service,2
"With O2 i havenever had a call cut off unexpectedly and have never been out of range, I will continue to use them as there service is second to none.",2
Great signal in my area and the broadband service is £10 p/m for unlimited upto 20MB broadband.,2
I like em for their good value service,2
"I have tried the other networks and O2 just delivers the business.  Always answer the phone quickly when I have a query, my local store are always very helpful.  I even took broadband from them!",2
"Alwasy had a great experience, from problems to rewards, thank you.",2
"i've been with O2 for almost 6 years and have never had a problem, they offer value for money and are very helpful if a problem does arrise",2

"I get unlimited texts and internet on pay as you go every time i top up with £10, these last a month and then i just use my £10 credit- couldn't ask for anything better. It's AMAZING!",2
Two friends have changed to O2 for service and coverage. Transfer made easy and package perfect.,2
Always been very helpful and good value for money.,2
Excellent signal coverage !Superb 3g services !,2
Customer service = GoodValue for money = goodTech support = goodWhat more can you ask!!,2
I do find network coverage is much the same for all mobile operators (except 3 which was v unreliable) but the O2 telephone and online support is first rate. I recently transferred my home and mobile broadband to O2 as well and that was a pain-free experience with great service too.,2
"The best customer service I have experienced for years, you get to speak to a human being located in UK that actually is polite and knows what they are talking about. Very helpful...would never go anywhere else.",2
"Excellent customer service, excellent all over!!!",2
o2 for me are the best mobile company as ive never really been with another apart from orange but i changed from orange to o2 a while back because of the deals they done for example if i was to top up £15 pound a month i would get free text message untill the end of the month also to other o2 callers its cheaper. You also get to put in a code with certain amounts of money you top up the better prizes you would be able to win.,2
"i have 2 contracts and an 02 money card with 02..i have found them to be the best coverage in my area, have the best phones and are always helpful when i need them to bei am seriously considering changing my broadband from BT to 02 also because i like them so much and im kinda loyal like that",2
"I have been with 02 now for 6 years and have never ever hadaq problem with reception, i have a pay as you go phone and they give you rewards for topping up for as little as £10 a month also rewards every 3 months for topping up at all great customer sevice and i will never change.",2
I have always been on O2 for all my life. That says it all really.,2
"Fantastic Customer Service, helpful and polite which is really rare these days, couldnt be more accomodating, i was thinking of leaving as they are not the cheapest but to be honest, i have had no problems so why spoil a good relationship",2
O2 Are simply THE BEST! - Great offers and at low prices!,2
i have now been on o2 for about 4 years and cannot fault them if i have ever had a problem there customer services was always polite helpful and straight to the point there network coverage is second to none and there tariffs are the best out there in my opinion why anyone would select a different service provider is beyond me as o2 provides quality care competative prices and exellent network coverage10/10,2
I have been with most of the other mobile phone service providers and have never had this level of service. When you talk to anyone from o2 on the phone be it a change of priceplan to just general information they are always pleasent and willing to help in anyway.,2
"no complaints at all, bill never excessive and have never had any problems with connections.",2
Fantastic service from O2 staff in quickly locating an iPhone 4 for me. Excellent follow up by the sales person and excellent service from the update service as to availability and locality. O2 are the best for customer service bar none.,2
I recently upgraded to iPhone 4 with O2 and it was the easiest thing I have done. I Love the phone and cannot wait to see the great service O2 will provide me :-),2
I have been with O2 for many a year & have heard some very bad reviews about there customer service. I have just recently upgraded my handset & could not have been treated better. The CS rep was very understanding & knowledgable about the options I had & within 24hrs my new handset was with me.,2
"Whenever i've had a problem i've phoned o2 and it's been sorted out straight away, they are very friendly and helpful. I've been with o2 for about 4 years and wouldn't use any other network.",2
"Have been with this company since my first mobile (back in the days when they were almost as big as bricks) never had any problems either dealing with customer service or with reception on phones, all this and still on pay as you go.",2

"I am very pleased with this network. They allowed me an early upgrade to the new iPhone 4 and gave me an amazing deal along with it.If I ever need to contact them there is always a polite, happy, helpful employee on the other end of the phone willing to help with any problem.Also their network coverage is excellent, I am able to get signal just about anywhere. I always recommend 02 to all of my friends.",2
very helpful all the time! good prices to,2
I am with O2 for last 3 years. I get great reception in any corner of the house where rest of the mobiles give up. Keep up the coverage O2 and get some competitive pricing.,2
"They just cancelled my (unnecessary) phone insurance, at 4pm on a Sunday, within 15 minutes! And refunded me the rest of the month's cost.I've been with them for years for their great service and reception, and they just get cheaper and cheaper",2
Over the years I have left O2 to try other networks (why leave if it's so good? like most people - you think it's a better deal) I always ended up going back to O2 before my contract had even finished.O2 online does some good deals. Recently I moved from Simplicity to a regular 18 month contract and as I was impatient I went into the store to get the phone. O2 then noticed I was normally an O2 online customer and automatically put me back from offline to online.I appreciated that as you get more for your money that way.Only thing I query is why the deals in store can't be the same! But as it doesn't really effect me I won't knock them down!Will never leave O2 for another network ever again - I've learnt that lesson!,2
