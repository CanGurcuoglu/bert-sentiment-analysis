"Visited the Oxford Didcot branch. Had poor experience over the phone downgrading me misold me & was about to leave 02. Was greeted by Nathan in store. Extremley empathetic, efficient, honest, understanding and went above & beyond for me. His service is why o2 retained my loyalty. He logged my complaint & did all in his power to provide excellence in service. His manager jamie also supported with my overall experience. Thank you very much didcot. Highly recommend.",2
"It seems that all the 1 star reviews are because of bad customer support, but I didn't have any issues so I didn't run into them. I previously used giff gaff and my family used Plusnet mobile. When Plusnet mobile was shut down, we all decided it was time to switch to a different provider. I chose O2 and got my family to switch and so far my experience has been great! The service is really good and free roaming is amazing. I really like O2 and everyone in my family has had a great experience.",2
"I must say that not every time I needed a help from o2 i got my issue solved. However, this time, Huzesa, answered my call and he explained why my first bill is bigger than what my contract states (first bills are calculated pro-rata) … he was helpful and sorted my query.",2
"I visited the 02 Elgin store recently as my phone contract was due for an upgrade.I was welcomed into the shop and guided to an adviser that could help me. Sorry but I can't remember his name but he was very helpful explaining everything, answering my questions and most of all listening to what I wanted for my next contract. No hard sell but he did advise me of all offers available to me that day.All  upgrade was completed in about 20 minutes and I left the shop happy. Thank you guys at the 02 Elgin shop🙂",2
I popped into O2 Ashford High Street in Kent to upgrade my old phone. I was looked after by Laura who guided me through various options helping me to understand the Pros and Cons. She was honest and straight forward suggesting things I could avoid which would have cost more and I was unlikely to use. On my return the following day she set the phone up transferring the data from the old phone. She checked with me to ensure everything was there. Laura has suggested I come back with the old phone to get £100 once I am happy all the data has successfully gone over.This service was excellent and Laura is the perfect ambassador for O2.,2
"I was on unlimited with o2 I got advised to on to the 250gb as I'm nowhere near even the 250gb I was advised to be put on based on my unlimited usage.I have the best value for money phone deal/data deal combined with excellent Internet signals no matter where i go working in the entire Manchester area.The people I speak to  at 02 are excellent call handlers and sales teams,it reflects on the 02 infrastructure.Mike",2
I had a call with Saket from O2 to help with my account on MyO2. He was very helpful and polite throughout and was respectful of my caution towards sharing details which I had due to past experience of several fraud calls. Very patiently went through the entire process with me and helped me resolve the issue. Thank you so much to Saket.,2
"Customer service worse than non existant, make it close to impossible to contact anyone and when you do they do their very best to cunfuse.  Trying to leave 02 is very difficult, friction being used to the n'th degree.I guess from a O2 profit perspective providing a good service comes second to getting you stuck on  contract that increases massively in price each year and O2 making it as difficult to get out of the contract.",2
"Customer service agent Rohit is the best. Extremely helpful with helping me transfer my old number to new SIM card. Introduce me with loyalty plan 20% off monthly plan fee for my daughter, not pushing me to join but accommodating my new late starting date. Professional and polite.",2
"Popped into the Stafford store this morning to upgrade my iPhone at the end of my existing contract. I’d done my research so I knew exactly what I wanted and the salesman could not have been more helpful. Guided me through transferring all my stuff which took just over an hour on my office internet. Cheers guys and thank you so much, here’s to another 3 trouble free years!",2
"I have contacted O2 couple of times in last month and I must say I was positively surprised about the customer service I have received. I think sometimes the customer service people have been way too polite, which was a bit annoying, but they sorted my issue.Joseph answered my last call and he switched my phone number during the call. He understood I had a few more concerns and he needed a bit of further advice, so he transferred me to Shayda, who set my spend cap and send me an email with a link to get my free subscription.All phone call did not last more than 30 minutes, so hopefully next experience will be again positive oneShame the signal is really bad in rural areas around Cambridge :(",2
I was having problems this morning with my Bank not able to send otp to my mobile. I then realised that my mobile was indicating no service available. After trying to solve the problem on line I got through to an O2 Asion call centre. The agent spent considerable time and patience solving the problem. His efforts were most appreciated.,2
"Had no issue with O2 since 2022. Recent added charges prompted review. Had a spending cap that apparently does not work abroad (did in past) O2 stuffed me with £66 bill but I guess could be worse as I read some dreadful stories.Update, o2 has rectified issue",2
"If this helps to contact. Phoned 202 and chose to cancel, another list and chose other business. Put through to upgrades and complained about bill charges, obviously wrong department and put through to accounts answered almost immediately. Gentleman from Mumbai was excellent, reimbursed the over charges and gave good advice. Round about way of getting there but worked for me, 5 stars for Dominique in Mumbai only not o2.",2
"I was talking to O2 staff member from South Africa amazing person very polite knows what he’s doing really should be training other people how to be talking to customers he knows exactly what he’s saying and he knows exactly what he’s doing. Appreciate all the work and effort that he did for me, his name is Nhlakanipho mtshal thank you very much and thank you for everything. Keep up the good work and to this managers let me tell you that he a great worker and you know how to talk to customers.",2

"Great efficient, warm and friendly service from Daphne at 02 branch just now. Resolved issue super quickly. Was outside as shutters opened and she offered nice welcoming friendly service with smile to myself and another gentleman. Exactly what you want from customer service.",2
Great service from Alex at Wakefield 02 store always helpful and sorted things out for usWhen something didn’t go right he did t fob me off he dealt with it himself and made sure all completed would thoroughly recommend him lovely guy thanks Alex,2
Recently stopped to O2 as my contract with 3 had come to an end and they were charging outrageous roaming charges for when I am in Europe. Now for under £10 a month I have free roaming in Europe and a smooth transfer of my mobile number.I buy my own phones and have sim only deals which is the way to go!,2
"My initial contact with O2 was terrible as i was speaking to handlers from abroad who didn’t understand what I was saying and we’re trying to hard sell me products. However, My call was eventually handled by a gentleman called Shervan - he was from Manchester. He was fantastic at understanding my issues and resolved them with his obvious knowledge on O2 products and services, patience, and care. He talked me through my options and provided excellent advice and didn’t push me to buy anything - but made me feel comfortable and confident to purchase an upgrade. I thank him.",2
Called to O2 shop in Abbeycentre Newtownabbey today for a quick query on using my phone abroad. Craig could not have been more helpful he even fixed a glitch on my phone while he was at it!Just as Customer Service should be.,2
"Reymar John, you’ve been fantastic! Your service was outstanding, you listened to every single query and delivery exceptional customer service and handled all discrepancies and queries with ease! 10/10 service thank you!",2
Lacking in knowledge of what my next moves were when my contract was ending I didn't want to rush anything so I wanted to just do a sim only contract. After speaking with Nick and him going through a few different options as well as filling in the gaps in my knowledge he showed me a great deal and even wiped the remainder of my device plan. An absolute pleasure to speak to and if I could have given Nick a 6 star rating I would have,2
"A massive shout out to the staff of the O2 store in Workington today . Their patience has to be applauded for the complex cases I witnessed today including mine while working understaffed . All worked effectively as a team but my big shout out goes to Jan - you are an asset to the store, keep up the good work guys",2
After a very difficult morning being passed around three different people and departments that lasted over an hour I finally spoke to Teagan who solved all of my problems in just a few minutes. Please recognise Teagan for being a star and taking ownership of the problem. The rest of the experience before that was abysmal. I also spoke to a lady called Tolu a few weeks ago. She was also brilliant. Put these two in charge of training the rest of the team please.,2
"I've been heavily critical of O2 in the past, but it seems things are improving. I just rang O2 to sort a relatively technical issue, and was fearing the worst with wait times and level of assistance.7 minutes from dialling to hanging up, query sorted quickly and efficiently. The call was answered within seconds of me completing the menu, and they fixed my account in minutes.I'm usually quick to criticise and slow to praise, so it's only fair to give good reviews when they're deserved!",2
"Alisha was super helpful in paying off my device plan, getting a new sim only tariff that suited my needs and at a cost that I could meet, as well as updating my account details and providing guidance on possible discounts. Absolutely fantastic!",2
"Recent good experience with O2. We got PAYG Sims and topped up with vouchers to activate Big Bundle packages, which have worked exactly as promised, including in the Europe Zone.My husband hit a glitch and was asked to top up another £15 to make a call that should have been covered by the Big Bundle, but we were able to get prompt and helpful customer service from O2 to sort this out.Pleasing to deal with a telco that lives up to its promises!",2
I contacted the webchat to try and sort a cheaper data roaming plan. Yashwi was phenomenal and is a shining example of how to give fantastic and flawless customer service. Yashwi went out of their way to ensure they did everything possible to reach a positive result. Not only have so many of my worries regarding finances been resolved but this interaction and experience has stopped me from ending my custom with O2. Please ensure Yashwi receives the praise they deserve. They are a truly wonderful person!!,2
"Upgraded on the 25th March Uxbridge branch. Lovely young man talked me through the process was professional friendly polite and so knowledgeable. Made the experience simple and timely. Name began with M.27th went back in to make use of the samsung ipad offer and assistance as could not download Whatsap on my new upgrade. A young man YAHYA  very helpful polite , patient , professional and did it all for me. Great customer service just how it should be and credit due.Was advised also if any concerns with the ipad to come back in.Overall a very positive experience at 02 Uxbridge.",2
I've been a customer with O2 for many years and have never had any issues. Recently took out a additional product and struggled to activate the free extra Prime. After 3 attempts (phone calls/mesenger) I managed to get to speak to Ryan who to my relief was from the UK and could understand me 😀 Ryan had the issue sorted in minutes. I was really worried after reading all the bad reviews. Panic over. Happy customer.,2
"Great experience in Scunthorpe branch. Staff were very polite and helpful. In particular a lady called Lisa was amazing, going to great effort to get me the best deal and even compared across phone models. Walked away with a brand new phone with unlimited everything and smart watch for the price better than my previous contract of half the size storage 4gb of data and 2 phone generations before. To top it all off my upfront cost of the phone was waved, £100 knocked off the top and thanks to the current promotion I got some headphones for free. Don't have a single negative thing to say about my experience everything was well explained and I would definitely recommend.",2
"Spoke to Alan from the payment team this morning as I'd falling behind on my bill payments. He was honestly the most helpful person Iv spoken to in customer service for a long time explained what my options were and helped me set up a plan to clear my bill. Was a genuinely nice person, understanding and not patronising at all which I think you need when trying to sort out debt.",2
"I recently got the latest and greatest iPhone via o2, and the process of renewing my contract, and getting a great deal including a free Disney + package, made everything just that little bit sweeter. The agent I dealt with was very professional and polite, even when the line dropped (my fault) he made sure to drop me an email to conclude what we were discussing. Would highly recommend o2.",2
"Went into Cheltenham’s store yesterday as my brother in law, who has a degree of learning difficulties, SIM card was blocked. I have got to give a huge shout out to OLIVER who helped us get through the red tape and resolved the problem. Oliver, thank you so much for your time and patience!",2
The team at the Kings Road London branch are absolutely the best! I’ve been going there for years and the service is consistently great.,2
"I came into the Tunbridge wells shop and was helped by joseph who was incredibly knowledgeable and swapped my eSIM over to a physical one, set up my phone to actually receive data.After spending 2 days with Vodafone trying to fix the issue and only to have it resolved in under 15 minutes by joseph was a real win!",2
"I had a wonderful experience of o2. I signed up for 4 SIM cards (family). We ended up going for another deal just at the end the cooling off period (due to no fault of o2). I thought it would be difficult to leave. It was super easy. Agent Laeeqah was especially helpful. 10/10 to her. service for the period we had the sims was excellent. Great coverage, great connection, and the best international minutes I could find. Will definitely go back in the future.",2
"It took 4 staff, 5 automated systems and a 46 minute phone call to cancel a phone contract of £12 per month, absolutely ridiculous. It would also be useful if the phone line staff spoke fluent English as it's very difficult to understand what they are saying and vice versa. NEVER again will I be an 02 customer!",2
"I would just like to write this review, I spoke to William from 02 and it was a pleasure to speak with him today, he was very thorough, and very helpful with everything we discussed and he helped me out so much, I really appreciate everything he done for me and how lovely he was on the phone. He was an absolute gentleman, they definitely aren't made like that anymore 😀",2
My names Gurmac Singh. I spoke with Ash today and he walked me through ordering my phone as I was having issues and even arranged a call back to see if nothing has gone wrong which I’m awaiting. He had so much patience and knowledge and the customer service was unmatched!,2
"Darron of the 02 The Swan Centre EASTLEIGHHighly recommended Darron ensured we were totally satisfied, well informed and left more than happy to return.Excellent service and put the 02 in Winchester to shame.Go to Eastleigh for all your needs worth the travel you won't regret it! Thankyou Darron 02",2
Writing this on behalf of my brother Michael because he doesn't have an account with trust pilot but he wanted to say Shane from the Customer Service team who spoke to him  around 5:30pm today was very helpful helped him get his PAC code. He mentioned he usually dreads calling phone companies but Shane made it very easy.,2
"Sorry I was angry. I had trouble to login, but after getting through to customer support everything seems to be working fine. Thank You.",2
"I have been to lakeside Thurrock o2 shop for upgrade, been served very quick and nicely done by a worker called Tyler , he does exactly what I asked him , faster and perfection, , I highly recommendThank you",2
"Found myself in a most complex situation regarding a contract I had cancelled during the ‘cooling off’ period.Called into the Derby store and was fortunate to have the attention of the team leader, Jade.This pleasant lady was knowledgeable and helpful and patiently resolved a long standing problem.Credit where credit is due.",2
There's a reason why I stay with 02. Aside from the brilliant tariffs for being a loyal customer it's also the brilliant customer service provided in store.Wanting to upgrade a new phone Rob and Paul at the Stockport store were helpfulness personified. Not only did they text me at my time to be served (so I could go away and have a coffee) Rob also transferred all my data while I did a bit of shopping for an hour.Wouldn't go near another store for a new phone or a provider for a great tariff.,2
"I called on behalf of my Mum, she was with me when I made the call (GDPR ) and 02 was brillant, they offered a great deal so that Mum doesn't have to worry about monies and big expense.",2
"I went into the Watford store and Bill was amazing. He was knowledgeable easy to talk to, pointed out benefits that were tailored to me. Helped me upgrade to a new phone, recycle an old phone, spoke to me about virgin media and overall made me feel very informed and also like I had got a great deal. This guy was brilliant",2
"Where ever I go O2, Where ever I breath O2, Where ever I get in  love O2, where ever I eat O2, Forever O2. past 23 years of Experience of UK and International  Mobile Network and Broadband O2 made me Sing a Song For them its Best For me Just be Kind to them they will return your Kindness back with quality honest and reliable service and they wont leave you your heart without pulse Thank you Again",2
"I am SIM only and generally it is a good experience. I don't appear to have the speeds I had with EE, but I am paying a lot less.However, and I am blaming the pixel 8 for this, it attempted to sign in to my pin code  at least 3 times in my pocket!!Anyway, so then I read you need a puk code and you get it through myO2. So I sign in and then it says you need to get the code from a SMS message.If the SIM is locked, it's a little difficult 🤬Maybe a different process should be advertised?Update: customer service were very helpful and polite and I got the puk code pretty fast.My lesson is, always backup your puk code.",2
I couldn't access my o2 account. Tried virtual assistant hoping to get trough to real life advisor but it wasn't possible because chat with advisor is available only after logging in account which I couldn't. That made me a bit annoyed and I tried to reach out to complain team about this issue but then after emailing I thought ill just try look if o2 have people working on Facebook. And they do. I successfully reached out to advisor on Facebook messenger who sorted it out for me very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised I thought I'd be asked to call customer team on the phone but no. Thank you Facebook team.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 10 years + and have just recently moved a family member over to the service. I had a bit of a complicated request but the advisor I spoke with, Sunil. M was incredibly patient, helpful and efficient! He really went above and beyond, which is rare when contacting any customer service line these days. I am really happy and want to say a big thank you to Sunil for all of his help. He is a credit to the o2 customer service team and I hope he receives this feedback (and a bonus!).",2
O2 have been extremely supportive of us whilst having issues with our partner company.Unfortunately the last few days whilst i have been trying to deal with an issue with the mobile contract i have not been able to get any answers....I have been promised Pac codes then told i cant have them.I have sent an email to complaints team on Tuesday and still havent had a response.There is no way of getting through to anyone who is willing to help or assist me.My business is suffering as  people cannot contact me.I just find it sad that i need help and cant access it,2
"I called O2 about a SIM card that was stolen from my letterbox and used to spend a large amount of money from my bank account on gambling sites. Justin immediately blocked the card, reported the case, and advised on where to go from here including providing the numbers I needed to report to the police and to get in touch with the gambling company and their regulator. Everything was explained perfectly and I could genuinely tell that he was trying his best to help.The best part, I'm not even an O2 customer, so for him to take an hour out of his day to help me is so incredibly appreciated. Not all heroes wear capes (unless you do, but I won't judge you for that).",2
"Despite the overall consensus on here I wanted to spread a little positivity and express what a wonderful experience I’ve just had with Sue in Telesales. She was incredibly kind and patient with me and thanks to her I came away with even more in my tariff for LESS money than I had anticipated! It was a truly wonderful ‘welcome’ to O2 and I sincerely hope others have the joy of dealing with Sue. She was so, so lovely and helpful. Thank you.",2
The sales man had excellent customer service and answered all the questions I had and  broke down all the queries I had. I had tried contacting the service provider but the other agents I had came across were not so helpful and quickly cut me off as I was a new customer.I spoke to Dylan Daniels for over an hour and he didn’t sound agitated or anything by the questions I had. I’d recommended Him over and over again. keep it up Dylan,2
"So far our experience of 02 has been excellent. We have two different numbers with them and I when I took out the second one the costumer service person suggested a way for me to pay less on the first, too, by changing contract. Monthly cost of each sim card is extremely low, and so far the coverage has always been good when out and about.",2
"I again had issue yet response was completely acceptable and I could notice for the 3rd time sice few weeks when contacting o2 customer service that finally things seem to go in right direction, also it was so nice to hear english person on the other site. Well done o2, keep going get this stars",2
"Possibly the best! Had been with O2 for both work and private mobile with no issues, but had a head fit one day in April this year and swapped to another provider (with a numerical name - see my other review!). Biggest mistake ever - ended up changing back to O2 this week and can't complain at all. Had to ring them this morning because of a problem - 2 minutes waiting, then spoke to a very halpful and polite member of staff (Jay?) in the call centre who sorted it in no time! Now I have a great signal wherever I go, and I've stopped pulling out my hair!",2
"Poole store, Imogen and Chris are amazing assets to the team. I’ve had so many problems regarding the upgrade of my phone and probably spent the equivalent to two days in the store and they were lovely and chatting away with me while my baby was fussing. You should be proud to have them apart of the team.",2
Brandon in the Banbury shop was an absolute delight with me today. Kind and patience. He sorted my problem out even though he hadn’t come across it before.Thank you so much Brandon.,2
"After having a lot of trouble with o2 insure sending me a faulty phone twice when claiming on my insurance, I went into the o2 shop on Westwood Cross and Gareth was able to help me get a new phone and get it sorted. He was amazing and the most helpful person I’ve spoken to with o2. Honestly made my day.",2
"Firstly i see alot of negative experience about the customer service but maybe i'm one of the few lucky ones. I just wanted to leave a review because the customer service today was very helpful.I took out a £8 contract with o2 with 30GB data and seemed a pretty good deal, unfortunately i do live out in the rural areas so signal is not the greatest (sometimes dropping to just 3G). It's a shame i'll be leaving because in urban areas you would get up to full bar 4G or even 1-2 bar 5G in city areas.The customer service was a little long winded to get through to different departments but once you're through they were helpful in cancelling my contract. (Although looking at some of the comments here, i hope it doesn't bite back and charge me extra!!)",2
"Spoke to Sivern from South Africa about setting up a new sim contract.  Even after all the current technical problems O2 have had, it was a pleasure to speak to someone who was friendly and competent. Sadly unusual to find someone who it both.Could not ask for a better initial contact with this company. I hope that anyone else in my situation is lucky enough to talk to Sivern",2
"Just visited Salisbury 02 store and had amazing service from Nik!been years since I have since such efficient, charming and swift service for mobile!  Outstanding! Will defo purchase next phone deal with him!",2
Recently came back to o2 after leaving them for a cheaper service. Cheaper isn’t always better!! Came back and wanted to port my numbers. Had to ring customers services and they were nothing but helpful. Took them a few days because of a technical error. I’ll be staying with o2 now!,2
"I have had to call O2 3 times today due to problems with my phone.  I have spoken to a different person each time and each one of them has been polite, friendly and very helpul.  They all knew what they were doing and talked me through what I had to do in a way I understod - not being tech savvy.I read the reviews before I called and was dreading the experience but in fact, it could not have been easier.  Yes a bit of a wait to get through but not too bad.",2
"Rohan via web chat on Saturday morning was very assertive understanding and found me the best deal on o2 switch up! I can say being the most valuable customer with o2 since the age of 15/16 it has been very hard dealing with o2 customer service team in the past. I think they need more colleagues like Rohan not only did he get me the best deal and sort everything out promptly swiftly and smooth, but when I also had another query he diverted me straight away which was bit painful but manage to get what I needed thank you once again Rohan for all your help and support!",2
"I have both a pay monthly phone contract, and a PAYG SIM I use for a router at our holiday home, and I find both work well and are very easy to manage via APPs or website.",2
Today I contacted o2 about my account.I was greeted by a Gentleman called Ashish.In all my years with o2 I have never had such a pleasant conversation with a man who was very knowledgeable about the products and services.  Ashish helped me with my account  query and device so efficiently that I had to come on trust pilot to thank him publicly.  A glowing asset to O2 and I hope they recognise this.   Well done Ashish!,2
"I've been using the O2 SIM only deal at £9.99 per month for a while now, and overall, my experience has been quite positive. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Service Quality:** The service has been good. I haven't encountered any significant issues with connectivity or customer support. The process of getting the SIM and setting it up was smooth and hassle-free.**Network Performance:** The network works great. I get reliable coverage in most areas, including both urban and rural locations. Data speeds are consistent, and I haven't experienced any dropped calls or prolonged outages.**Value for Money:** At £9.99 per month, this deal offers excellent value. It meets my needs without breaking the bank, and I feel I'm getting a good amount of data, texts, and minutes for the price.**Overall Experience:** So far, so good.

"Having read the reviews on trustpilot for O2 I was sceptical about the service I was going to receive. I was calling to cancel a contract, Harley, who dealt with me was incredible!! I had no intention of staying with O2 already taking out a sim-only contract with another provider. However after explaining what I could afford to pay and the deals I'd seen online, Harley was able to get me an offer I couldn't refuse.Incredible service and Harley is a credit to the team!",2
"Abigail from your cancellations team went over & above for me today.  She wasn't able to resolve my problem so consulted with her colleagues several times,  she was very patient & listened to my issued & relayed this to relevant people.",2
"In spite of many negative reviews , I  was delivered excellent customer service by Kurt. He was a fantastic active listener. He found a solution for the issue that I had and solved it straight away. It has been about a year since I have been with this company, I called them several times and they did the best . Thank you",2
"Went to O2 yesterday in Telford and she gave me great advice on getting the right phone at the best price.Have been with them for years and not had any problems, that's my experience anyway",2
"Ola Onwunli was excellent! I have just had excellent customer service from Ola. She was polite, professional and incredibly patient with me, as I was getting a bit mixed up. Thank you so much Ola.",2
We had a big issue with my husbands 02 account. We cancelled the account in the correct procedure. But the person we spoke to did not process cancellation correctly and we was going to be charged £320 incorrectly. 02 in Hempstead Valley Gillingham Kent was totally unsupportive and said we was liable and very unhelpful. Not customer focused at all n not interested.We went to 02 in Chatham Kent. We asked for help and the staff where brilliant. Kree (Male assistant) went out of his way to help us big time. He resolved the problem with help of customer services on the phone and his determination with us. It was an error in 02’s staff and want to thank Kree for his totally customer focused service and a fantastic job. Highly recommended to all customers. Do not go to Hempstead Valley Gillingham as not customer focused.,2
"Spent ages with one of the representatives and got nowhere as soon as Christopher got on the phone he dealt with my query quickly and effectively, hats off he turned around a bad experience ! Thank you mate",2
Just spoke to a lovely understanding guy called Gill. He helped me no end even looked at changing my tariff to try and save me some money. Thank you so much for being understanding and patient,2
I had been receiving fraudulent calls offering half price contracts on my existing o2 phone. Extremely convincing scam with the fraudster even giving agent ID then asking to confirm to them my email address (but I knew o2 have it already) so I called and spoke to a man called Ashyun in your call centre who did rigourous security checks and really helped explain what to look out for with these scams. He helped secure my account and did a fantastic job helping me when I was in a very stressful situation.,2
"Lauren at Bexleyheath store was really help full and went beyond my expectations to help resolve changing my pay as you go to pay monthly mobile. I cant recommend this store enough for the help I received this week, very pleased!",2
"This is a five star review for BEDFORD SHOP- The assistance name is Raima.I went in with a problem with my phone contract, I didnt understand how to sort this out and found the 202 customer service not able to help me. Raima was helpful and reassuring, and sorted the issues, going over and above to ensure I had a working phone, she took the time to sort this despite pressure of a busy shop. The customer service was amazing- I had been in to the Cambridge shop in the Grand Arcade and they were unhelpful and rude- Cambridge have a lot to learn from their colleagues in Bedford. A huge thank you to Raima.",2
"Reported a little issue on my last bill to O2 this morning. The matter was resolved by a very responsive, customer service orientated gentleman, Adnan. He is an asset to your company.",2
"Long story short I ordered an upgrade 9th of June, paid my last year off of my old contract in full (£260).Been sent the wrong device and then a broken device, then told it would be sorted and a new phone sent on a next day delivery, 5 weeks ago.  Ive been waiting 8 weeks in total now and still no phone.I've logged over 10 hours of complaints in total, over 7 hours on webchats, I was told last week it would be sorted and a phone would be sent within 5 working days, 7 days later and still no phone, again.  I can't cancel the contract as they said they'll charge me for the device, £1500, which they've never sent.Honestly just stay well clear, I'm going through the ombudsman next week and hopefully they can help resolve this because this is the worst company I have ever dealt with. Customer service is horrendous, I've just been lied to and fobbed off constantly.To add Insult I've been a customer for over 15 years.",2
I visited 02 in Romford Essex. I received excellent service from Charlie and he helped in resolving an issue for me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable.,2
In particular staff in Kingston branch called Monica was amazing and  good customer service. We have four fraud issues recently she has been resolved as soon as possible.,2
"I don’t think I’ve ever spoke to a more understanding and empathetic customer service advisor! Washiela took her time to look into my account, despite me speaking to someone different 45 minutes prior and getting nowhere (who came across as rude and couldn’t wait to get me off the call) Washiela explained everything to my academic knowledge and led me to understand everything that she was telling me. Washiela was extremely empathetic of my financial situation, explained everything perfectly so I understood the following steps. Washiela is a great asset to the o2 customer service team and I strongly believe fellow colleagues could learn a lot from her. Incredible service, thank you again Washiela 🫶🏼",2
Rexth was really helpful and polite I was having trouble with my o2 roaming and helped resolve the issue and made me feel much better.Credit to the company and contributes to why I’ve stayed with o2 for so many years.,2
"Zhed! What an amazing man! I always seem to get people that really go above and beyond to help others and you were one of them. You were patient, kind and actually took time to listen to me! Every woman’s dream! Honestly Zhed thank you so so much! You’re going to make an amazing husband!",2
"I contacted 02 today to discuss my contract that recently ended, l was not looking forward to the call as l am an I.T and Mobile Phone dinosaur and know very little or nothing about Mega Bytes, Giga Bytes or any other Byte.I got through to a Customer Services Officer called Kirsty and all l can say she was an absolute star. She listened to all my questions and responded in a helpful, professional and respectful manner. She explained things clearly and repeated things that l did not understand.Based on my call with Kirsty l will be remaining with 02 for the next 24 months and l also have a clearer understanding of the contract. There was no ""Hard Sell"" or ""Gimmicks"" about better offers, and the icing on the cake is that l have a cheaper monthly bill and my data has been reduced as l never use the amount of data on my contract.I am happy to remain an 02 customer with special thanks to Kirsty. I am still a dinosaur, but l am a much better informed dinosaur.",2
"Great shop experience from the Ashton Under Lyne branch, efficent and knowledgeable.We went into the store to get a sim only deal for my daughters first phone.The week before a helpful team member advised us of the best deal and as we were an O2 customer already that we would get a further 20% off.  There was no hard sell.The following week we went in, a different team member, helped us get the same deal and we were done in less than 20 minutes.Other mobile phone shops i have been too in the past, i have been there ages and often a smell upselling.  This was not the case from this store.  Good work!",2
Spoke to Sivern (South Africa branch)He explained everything very clearly and gave me a better deal than I had chosen online. Friendly but professional and patiently re explained anything I was not sure of the first time explained.,2
I went into my local O2 branch in Meadows Shopping centre Portadown.  I was  greeted by a lovely  man called Gareth. He was very helpful and went above and beyond to explain my account and get me the best deal to suit me . He was very professional and polite. A pleasure to be served by him .,2
"Good experience yesterday when I visited O2 Oxford St store at a time when they were lean on staff. James exercised helpful, flexible, willing customer service keeping queuing customers informed and keeping the queue moving on what appeared to be a busier than expected day. Thanks James!",2
"I ordered on the Sunday & my number was ported& sorted on the Thursday morning ( it would have been a day earlier but  it was after 6 pm on the Tuesday  I wanted to keep my number. Great communications and updates   it went like clockwork. I was with Tesco Mobile for years but after being ignored for 20 mins and blanked by the salesman there....not so much ""I'll be with you soon or you're next"".. just totally ignored. That said 60gb for £9.99 was a saving of £1 per month & FIVE times the data that Tesco were offering.  I've tested the sound quality and it's better believe it or not,even though Tesco piggyback  on  O2 network!. The app is easy to use even to someone who has hit 3 score and 12... Many thanks O2 for a trouble free switch",2
"O2 shop Redhill, Surrey.Fantastic service from Colin who spent a lot of time helping me transfer my old iPhone to a newer one. There is no way I would ever have been able to do it myself as I really struggle with tech stuff. A great member of staff. Very, very much appreciated. Thank you Colin",2
We’ve had our phones for a week now and would like to thank the team at o2crewe for their help especially Olena and Shaun for sorting us both out and making our little dog welcome many thanks and take care,2
Been with o2 mostly all the time since 2003 my first mobile connection. Always had great service and their local store here is very friendly and helpful. Always had good deals for phones and Sims. Recommended.,2
"My experience initially was really bad and quite stressful. I called on the 16th, 17th and 18th of October 2023 to explain my problem that my old number hadn’t ported to my new phone. I was told on the 18th, I’d get a call between 10am and 11am today the 19th of October 2023 and no call arrived. This is a very stressful time for me as I’m currently undergoing treatment for colon cancer and I didn’t have the energy to keep calling and being on hold for 30 minutes each time. I gave it one last attempt and eventually after being put through several departments got through to an advisor called Rikki. Her compassion and customer service was exemplary and she swiftly ensured my old number was ported to ensure I didn’t miss any crucial hospital appointments that get sent to my old number. I can't stress enough how much pressure this hasn’t taken off me during this difficult time. Thank you Rikki for your excellent service! This 5 star rating is for your service!",2
"Easy to apply, changed tariff a few times (glad you can do so easily), eSIM downloaded straight away. Great connection all round. Haven’t had a problem and are pleased with the quick process.",2
"I would like to say a huge thank you to two customer service assistants at 02.Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the first lady I spoke to.She was polite, professional and put me through to BECKY SMITHWho is based in South Africa.I have attempted on many many occasions to get a record of my data usage for a particular day on November 2022. and failed every time.This week I decided to have one last attempt before making an official complaint to 02's head office in Slough. This information is very important to me because  it concerns a court case next week nearly a year after the offence.I was amazed to find Becky was polite,professional and efficient.She found the day I needed and gave me the information. She has promised me and I really do believe her that I will receive an email before Thursday 5th October to help me prove  my case.Many thanks Becky it was such relief to receive such quick and efficient service.Kind regards.Mrs. N. Thomas",2
"Called on a Sunday evening as I had damaged my phone, ordered a new phone as I was due an upgrade In a few months anyway. The caller had to call me back once due to my error, lack of Information that I had to gather for him. Called me back on the dot, sorted and the phone was delivered 10AM on Monday morning! Super quick, helpful service. I've been with 02 for over 5 years now and never had an Issue. Brand new phone, for less than my old phone per month. Thankyouuuuu!!",2
"I visited O2 bon accord and the reception was good. The staff that attended to me on both occassions were lively and ready to help.O2 network in my house, school, and workplace is excellent",2
"Had a very positive and swiftly efficient experience in the SUTTON O2 store today with INTISAR (following a disastrous on line experience yesterday where, after an hour, I was cut off without achieving my change of tariff). INTISAR dealt with me immediately and gave me impeccable advice, finding me the best tariff for my needs. This was further improved at no extra cost because I am also a Virgin customer. I am saving £17 a month and getting a better tariff! Thank you INTISAR for making me feel valued as a customer of over 20 years (unlike O2 online who almost lost me as a customer yesterday and obviously didn't care) THANK YOU",2
"We were with 3 for many many years and after they put up our deal we decided time to move provider. We looked on u switch and found a great deal with 02 but we wanted to get our existing numbers. Our best option go in store and get help to do this. We went to 02 store in Staines. Here we were helped by the Manager Sian ? (Sorry if wrong) who was amazing did everything for us to do with transfer, account etc. could not have been more helpful. 02 kept us informed the whole time. Thank you Sian and 02.",2
"Today, I went into the o2 shop in York, with my two friends to buy a new phone. The sales assistant James was absolutely phenomenal, he made a stressful situation seem so calm. He listened to what I wanted and gave great advice on both the phone and the price. Overall I am so happy with my new phone.James you are an icon!!Anya, Grace and Emily",2
"As a new mum its hard to find the time to complete tasks. I thought I'd call as soon as i had a spare moment to discuss my tariff. Unfortunately the first agent i spoke to was unhelpful, impatient, rude and had the odassitty to hang up the call without answering my query. So much for customer service, she simply couldnt be bothered. This really upset me as i speak and treat others how i wish to be dealt with. I called up again to discuss the same query. I spoke to a lad called Vishal who dealt with the query and helped me change to a better tariff. Well mannered and patient with me and my baby. Treats customers like family and is an asset to the company. If it wasnt for Vishal i would have moved to another company. Thanks Vishal 👍🏽",2
"Up until now we've rarely had issues with o2. Now I'm seriously angry.I desperately need help regarding a code for an offer that was on when we refreshed my daughter's phone in December. We were told that the code -for Galaxy Buds for £1- would arrive via text within 30 days but have heard nothing. Over the last 10 days I have phoned customer services 8 times,for at least 20-30 minutes per call. I still am no closer to getting this resolved. It is extremely frustrating and time consuming. We are seriously considering leaving o2 altogether (5 members of our family,all on pay monthly contracts,some for at least 10 years) . We keep getting palmed off,telling us to wait 48 hours for an email,then it was being escalated and we had to wait another 5 days,it's now been 7 days and nothing. Every time we phone we have to recount the entire story AGAIN,very difficult when all the advisors have extremely strong accents  and we can barely understand them. Still no closer to getting the Galaxy Buds then we were when we tried to sort it ten days ago. Would never recommend o2 to anyone.",2
"Great customer service advisor and technical team member. Andrew contacted me following an issue I reported with a PORT made from Three network to O2, he dealt with the issue swiftly identifying what the cause of it was and resolved the issue with the technical team.Many thanks.",2
"Spoke with Soco, she was lovely and very cheerful. She helped resolve my problem straight away and explained to me why it had happened and how to avoid it in the future. Great experience:)",2
"Honestly i had been with o2 for years, never had an issue at all with them until this week. I would have recommended them to everyone before this ordeal.I had to call every day since monday to try get my issue resolved. I was lied to, dismissed and generally the customer service I had recieved was pretty awful, I dont think I had ever experience such terrible customer service in my life and it changed my view on the company drastically.So why am I giving it 5 stars?. Because finally, after speaking to an agent today my issue was resolved. She was extremely helpful, patient, kind and just the embodiment of the what amazing customer service should be like. She understood my issue, she was honest with me and instead of apologising and dismissing me like other agents before, she LISTENED and took action. From that one agent alone has restored a tiny bit of my faith in the company that I had lost after this whole ordeal. I can't thank her enough. It's good to know there's still some good agents left in the company.",2
"The member of staff at The Strand, London, store was very helpful in getting my iPad all set up for me.Well recommended.",2
I have a 3 account on 02 and I'm having a problem logging in to check my bills and tariff. I called customer service and I spoke to Harrold from the Philippines he was very helpful and I all the information I needed he provided in detail his very very good…and polite,2

Would just like to say a big thank you to luke the shop manager at 02 epsom as a pensioner dont always get things the first time but he had the patience of a Saint and a great sense of humour,2
I was helped by an assistant called Carl in the o2 shop in Birkenhead. I can’t recommend him more highly. He sorted out my issues with my phone and went above and beyond to assist me. Thankyou so much for your service 10 out of 10 and much more.,2
Called O2 on Monday regarding a data query and got through to a lovely guy called Jermaine (Manchester based) who was very friendly and helpful! Dealt with my query very quickly and efficiently! A great asset to your team! Hope this feedback gets passed over to him!!,2
Very good spoke with EMMERON she was very helpful and she very good spoke with me she is very kind and friendly I need say thank you very much you definitely do your job ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Called O2 three times but only after talking to a friend did I discover my 2g phone was no longer supported hence why I was not getting service. This should have been spotted, I had mentioned my phone was fourteen years so it should have been picked up. On the plus side I bought a new phone from O2 online. Nice phone for less than £20. Then I saw my old SIM was too big to fit. This is where O2 call centre in Manila did well. I was told I would receive a new Nano SIM, within four to five days, with my old number and my Pay as you Go balance added. This is what happened as described. Very happy now and really I was due a new phone. The only cost was for me was some inconvenience and my new phone. The service, phone calls, nano SIM were all part of the service. Thankyou O2",2
Very good service compared to others 3 networks I had...,2
"HiI went into the Newark branch of 02 today. The gentleman I saw was very helpful. I had not been able to receive phone calls on my Samsung Flip for ages, no signal bars. I assumed it was because a local signal tower had been taken down in my local village. However the gentleman, who I forgot to get his name, said there is hardly any signal on it now and that I should be getting signal as in a different area. The gentleman swapped my sim for a new one, no charge. I then went home and restarted my phone. Nothing no signal bars.I put my phone on aeroplane mode then shut aeroplane mode off. I had tried this before I had had my new sim put in but this did not work, but this time it worked. My phone is now working . Thankyou to the gentleman that helped me at 02 Newark branch he was very understanding and I felt he did everything he could to ensure my phone was set up to work properly and receive a signal.",2
This is to give a big shout out to Chrystian Briggs from your Crystal Peaks shop.He was very patient and helped me to choose a new phone and contract .Nothing was too much trouble for him .He helped me with transferring the data from my old phone on to my new one .I tried to give a review however it stated that this had expired .Thank you,2
Just done the climb was really apprehensive as I'm not the best fan of heights but I am so pleased I did it.  Our guide was Donnie and she made me feel at ease and was amazing thank you,2

"I'm not giving O2 5 stars I am giving it to the lovely lady by the name of Chelsea and her manager who was the only advisor who listened and within an hour she had sorted out the mess the other advisors had made and put me through  hell for 23 days without a phone, numbers that was changed and personal information and data transferred to another phone. A new contract that was broken and the phone turned off and no usage for 23 days on a new contract. I couldn't even phone my family and what if an emergency had occurred. Two phones without usage. The stress this cause me was unbelievable. The advisors who feed me lies and told me that all this would be sorted, they told me to wait first 24 hours then 48 hours, then 5 to 7 days then 5 to 10 days then another 5 to 10 days, and nothing. All this just for a migration of a number. I had in the end had to ring end my contract so I wouldn't be put through customer service, and the quy from the end contract but me through to the wonderful lady Chelsea who within the hour sorted out the mess 30 odd advisors couldn't or wouldn't do in 23 days. shame on them. The lies,the false information and even accusing me of fraud. O2 train those incompetence advisors to do the right thing.....Chelsea you and your manager are stars a big thank you to you for all your help. You know who you are",2
"Contacted o2 via facebook messages, and they re-connected on old number for me within hours, I see people complain about poor service, i suggest instead of telephone call to o2 that you send message via facebook, as I think you will get better response, you also have the added bonus that there is then a record of your conversation in case you do need to escalate anything. however I was very happy with the service I got from the people behind the facebook service of o2",2
So bad. The customer service is worst. They upgrading my contract without my permission and its also a breach of customer data.,2

"Went to the Hanley store for a charging wire/plug, they has exactly what I needed. Staff were friendly and the whole process was efficient.",2

"Today I had a phone call from a customer service number, usually I hang up these calls but I answered to find out who was calling me, it was O2, if it was something that I knew was a spam call I would have hung up, for instance a company I do not spend money with, I asked how do I know if this is a legit call and the person I spoke to, Nickyle or Nick reassured me by telling me a few personal account details I would only know, I was happy that I was speaking to the O2 firm, upon calling me up he helped me with a few queries and honestly went above and beyond, we ended the call as he was trying to find out information on stock and there was no more to be done but after an hour or so he called me back to tell me what the news was, what a good guy, knows exactly how to talk to people, being kind and polite, I hope when I upgrade again Ill speak to this guy again. Top man, 10/10, it might not sound like much but this guy went through lengthy efforts to help me understand and better myself off, I really cant appraise him enough. Cheers Nickyle.",2
"I uploaded a scam app by mistake and after 2 days of trying to delete this app unsuccessfully,  I decided to go to O2 in Stafford where I was introduced to Stacey who was so professional and understanding and persevered for 30 minutes of frustration to remove this app she refused to be beaten by this app and after alot of humming and tutting Stacey finally completed the removal of this app, I would like to thank Stacey once again for her determination and patience in completing this task, Stacey is a credit to O2 and a great asset to the Stafford Branch, thank you Stacey 10/10 .",2

Bought a new phone and Smart watch. Needed a remote connection between my phone and watch. Called in Rhyl O2 shop and spoke to Will. He spent a considerable amount of time trying to set the connection up but to no avail. Tried again on another day with Amy but no joy. Called  today and spoke to Will. He tried again and discovered an obscure problem that was preventing the connection. Issue solved! Can now use my watch remotely to make and receive calls and texts remotely without my phone being nearby using my phone contract allowance. Both Will and Amy have been incredibly professional and patient the whole time. My thanks go out to them and I would be happy to recommend Rhyl O2 shop without reserve.,2
"I find 02 very helpful. I have a sim only contract which is good value, and my wife and children all have sim only and O2 give them a 20% family discount. So all of us with 02 and we save money each month. Additionally I find 02s customer support friendly and supportive. 02 recently discounted my bill when travelling overseas as a goodwill gesture which I was impressed with (I had strayed to a nearby antenna from a neighbouring country and so was charged international data roaming), plus they discounted my wife's bill once as a goodwill gesture when we accidentally didn't buy the overseas travel bolt on for a few hours which lead to high data roaming charges for a few hours.",2
"Went into 02 in Harrow town centre where i was served by Eshan. Just want to say that despite Eshan being extremeley busy, and me not getting anywhere with customer services Eshan went above and beyond to ensure that before i left i had my old number reconnected and that my other queries where dealt with. Outstanding customer services. I actually thought that Eshan was a manager and believe that should anyone deserve to be promoted Eshan definatley should be",2
I had an issue with my security and i spoke to tarun and he helped me with the issues,2

"Adam from re-contracting (also known as upgrades) was fantastic. I called ready to switch back to pay as you go, as my contract was ending and I didn’t like the idea of being tied into a long contract. He was able to find me a 12 month contract which met my data usage needs and was a good deal. He explained everything clearly and professionally. I’d highly recommend him and o2! Thanks Adam!",2
May I ask you to pass on my thanks to a young man called Royston.  He was of great help to me.  He was effective and efficient. And very patient.  Got me sorted out very quickly.  I'm forever grateful to that young man.  He's a credit to your company.   Well done!!!!  From Phyllis O'Hara,2
"Excellent customer service from the Manager in the o2 shop North Street, Chichester, West Sussex. I am a pensioner and I struggle with phone tech stuff. My daughter took me to the shop in Chichester and the Manager there was just brilliant. He was so patient and explained everything in order to help me transfer my sim data from my very old phone to a newer iPhone. I was not rushed and I felt really good when I left the shop. Great Customer Service, thank you.",2

"I went with my husband to the O2 store at Eagles Meadow in Wrexham today for him to purchase a new phone. We were served by a young lady called Emily. We both agree that Emily is a credit to your company, she was helpful, knowledgeable and very engaging and a delight to speak too",2
Joined O2 around 10 days ago - in their Wakefield Branch.The staff were fantastic and not too pushy sales wise.Pricing was fair and great perks to go with.,2
"Opening an account went like a dream compared to previous network whom I left after just seven days due to startup and Porting problems.Good price, sim received next day, simple reliable app, easy setup, well done 02.",2
"Brilliant team to deal with very professional and knowledgeable, after nightmare experience with another provider it was like a breath of fresh air and only wish had changed sooner.",2
Recently tried EE  made sense to have the service as already a  BT internet customer who are partnered with EE.Cancelled contract with  02 however EE have left me without a service.Returned to 02  new contract sorted within 40 minutes and thanks to the gentleman called HAFEZ  very friendly and proffessional who navigated his way around the  mess caused by EE to ensure  I  had service.   I've lost my number of over 20 years due to EE  but working on recovery  needed for my customers and my cardiologist .  Thanks 02  and HAFEZ . Looking forward to recieving my new phone,2
"I was considering of posting a bad review.I have been a customer of O2 for more than 5 years now and paying them every month around £150 for my three contracts.I also pay for device insurance and although I went through three different contracts with them I never claimed for a damaged phone. Until today. Today, I called them to file for a claim for my water damaged phone, which flickered and shut down after being caught in a rain while cycling. There is condensation behind the cameras. The phone is paperweight now.They are going to charge me £90 excess fee which corresponds to the 24 hours device replacement service, however, I will be on a waiting list until they will get that phone back in stock, that if they will ever get it back in stock. In fact, O2 and I are both apparently running on hope on this matter. So when I told the customer service that I need a phone for work the guys just said: ""sorry, cant help you with that. Anything else?"" Now, I am going to shop for a second hand device to use.Maybe it's just me. Maybe I did not read the o2 insurance fine print? Who knows?. I am sure that O2 would not have let their customers down and be dismissive just like that. Maybe it's my fault for expecting too much out of this phone service provider, and my fault for not choosing Apple Care instead.O2 is a great company. Sadly, I am not such a great customer. All I did so far was to pay my contract in time and expecting for services to just work.",2
"The o2 at Ealing Broadway , Carlean is the best pearson to deal with any issue you have with your 02 account , she is knowledgeable, friendly and you really come out very happy with the service.I actually come all the way from Birmingham to see her .",2
"I had an issue with 2FA after I ported a number over to O2 not realising I'd used my O2 number for authentication and now couldn't access an account. It seemed a complex issue to resolve but the technical help from O2 was brilliant, and solved this problem quite quickly. I can't believe the poor reviews here, as I've had nothing but great service from O2, and they always seem to have the best contracts when I am looking to renew.",2
"Visited O2 store in Liverpool.Customer advisor Ellie could not have been more helpful,she is a credit to O2,pity a few more couldn't follow her example.First class employee",2
Virgin recently switched me to 02. I saw cheaper 02 deals than mine on comparison sites but they did not show on the 02 app. I rang 202 and their helpful agent changed me to a £5 twelve monthly deal with 10GB data and unlimited calls/texts.,2
"Following a major accident with my mobile phone, I found myself having to buy a new one. Although I'd bought it in another shop I found the customer service in O2, Clacton on Sea exceptional. Lewis and his colleagues went over and above to get the new phone working for me. They gave advice and were really helpful. Thank you",2
"Well Ive had the exact opposite experience from 02 Customer services, they couldn't have been more helpful. After security questions established I was helped by an extremely polite,professional individual.My issue was resolved and I was made aware of issues that will assist me greatly in the future. Hasn't been a smooth transition from Virgin mobile to 02, but 02 customer services couldnt have impressed me anymore. Thanks 02",2
"Called in the 02 shop in Wakefield today,I have a sim only contract.Asked if they could transfer data from my old phone to new one.The young lady who I think was in charge was lovely,and while there I noticed how well she treated her fellow assistants,she is a credit to your company.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years and have several contracts with them. They have always helped me find the best deals helping me save money on many occasions! - But this review is for Jiten, who has just given me the best service i have ever received from O2. He was professional, with amazing products knowledge but equally patient with me whilst i was being incredibly indecisive! Thank you for your time and service Jiten.(Sales department)",2
"Climbed the O2 this morning 11 am with my friend both celebrating our 60th birthdays. Our guide was Dan. The whole experience from beginning to end was wonderful,Dan was helpful from start to finish, Highly recommended. Thank you Lucia",2
"Very easy to deal with and seamless transfer from Three (Who are rubbish, see reviews) to O2. Ordered online, sim arrived as planned the next working day, filled in the transfer of number form, all transferred the next day. Great coverage, couldn't be better. Thanks O2.",2
"Had a problem with transfer from virgin to O2. On line help was very poor and misleadingWe went to the O2 shop in Kingsgate Huddersfield. A young kady called Charlotte  Middleton listened carefully and patiently to our problems and dealt with my phone first. We had to pick up our grandchild so she invited us back the following morning where she successfully fixed our other mobile.What an assett to your company. Knowledgeable,  patient and kind. Thankyou so much Charlotte",2
"I have found O2 to be a good mobile phone company, and the call centre staff are patient and helpful.I am abroad in the EU, but I forgot to set one of my phones for roaming (ending in -2973). I spoke to Zethu (on 04-07) and Selwyn (06-07) in S. Africa, and they were very patient and helpful. Selwyn resolved by problem, and I was up and running. Many thanks.My only complaint is that some of the S. African speakers MUST speak more slowly and clearly.",2
"A lady called Afsana was extremely patient , informative , kind and got the job done . Afsana rang me back when she said and I really could not ask for a better person to help me with setting up my consumer account and advising me on switching my business account . Thank you . I will stay with o2 for probably another twenty years happily .",2
"The interaction that I had with Kutala from O2 was outstanding! She is definitely a member of staff who knows her stuff, and delivers the help clearly and in a way that is easy to understand. Good luck to her and thank you! 👍",2
"Had a lot of questions about a contract and I spoke with Sharon lene on the phone who was very helpful and patient in explaining everything . Thank you for making an excellent customer service staff. Yes, the wait to speak to an agent is long but once they get through, they have always been helpful. I hope to always speak with kind and patient staff.",2
"Just had a phone call 10 mins before they shut with Hassan and honestly, brilliant customer service. He was fast, efficient And straight to the point. So so helpful, couldn’t thank him enough",2
"Good afternoonRecently I had an issue regarding payment of one of my accounts (mainly of a personal reason) that I hold with O2 …Well after speaking to the first advisor whom I found to be rude and not at all understanding or even cared!Shortly after I then realised that as a service company that I have dealt with for over 10 years without a break deserved another call, which i then proceeded to make as that person was not the O2 of old (I hoped) and have to say the customer service personnel (2nd call 26/06/2023) I spoke to was way above outstanding and a huge credit to the company and I’m so glad I made that decision ..Well I thought I should at least make the effort in writing to acknowledge that representatives’ good work plus genuine compassion and to convey my thanks.Fantastic customer service!O2 customer",2
I’ve been with o2 for long time never a problem  and as long as they do EU roaming I’ll stick with them,2
Saw a cheap deal online. Plusnet is closing so I thought good time to port my number across. Bought online. Sim arrived next day and number ported across two days later. Data speeds where I am are acceptable 5-20 mbps. Good attention to detail- on the O2 app my temporary number appeared but was replaced by my 'real' number after the porting finished.,2
I would like to point out I had the best support I could ask for from Connor in the Livingston West Lothian O2 shop. He went out of his way to sort out my problem with an app on my phone. Excellent customer service.,2
"O2 on my last contact was brilliant, Craig went out of his way to sort out my new Sim only plan and to ensure the online discount applied to ordering AirTags, he kept me up to date, managed expectations and called back as promised. He is a great asset for O2.",2
"Paul in retentions upgraded my sim only contract to unlimited everything deal. Excellent service from Paul. I agree that the network service can be improved and hopefully improve the coverage, especially with the possible merger between Vodafone and Three on the horizon.",2
"A great experience in Northampton store.2 Young lads Seb & sorry didn’t catch the others name helped us to sort out some issues we were unable to resolve ourselves, being techno dinosaurs! There were no sales, new contracts etc in it for them but their willingness to help and understand has ensured continued loyal business as I have been with O2 for over 25 years now.They are both a credit to the business.",2
"Spoke to Granbel on the phone for some help with my data on Monday. He couldn’t have been more helpful and patient, offering me solutions and recommendations for other relevant offers. A genuinely friendly person who was knowledgeable, professional and above all kind. He is a credit to the company. Thanks Granbel!",2
"I phoned today to upgrade my mobile and spoke to Shervan who was just outstanding and so helpful and polite what a credit to O2 he is, he listened to everything I wanted and got me a amazing deal and explained everyone step by step",2
The only network with full coverage where I live and where I work. Have been great to deal with and I've had really good deals off them as has my wife. Great offers included with Priority too. No issues and happy to continue with them as long as they continue providing the same in future.,2
Phoned up numerous times with little joy from agents. However on my 4th time got this very helpful gentleman.Credit to 02.,2
Excellent service from Nayam when I enquired about changing my tariff. Everything was explained. A credit to your company,2
So got my upgrade phone but none of the other adaptor etc in the order I thought would come together Phoned Shannon a lovely lady at O2 who put it right so very quicklyThree cheers for her She was polite kind considerate and professionalI believe in compliments where they are due There are far too many complaintsGiving a compliment gives incentive as it must be very demoralising if you are following your companies script and the customer is not happy Trying to get the balance right can be hard at times I’m sureI hope Shannon is recognised by her bosses We need more customer friendly people like her Thanks 🧡,2
"Meherzad provided excellent customer service and resolved my issue quickly with a polite, friendly manner.",2
Time to upgrade dayso rang O2 Retention Dept I hope if you have done the same you have got to talk to JayThis guy is definitely a dedicated team player who enjoys going to work His manner was friendly pleasant and polite He listened and instead of urging me to buy a plan that didn’t fit for a quick sale he found me the perfect phone at a fantastic price and ticked all the boxes tailored for me  He didn’t rush me one bitI’m always apprehensive at Upgrade time but Jay made sure I was happy He certainly knows the products I understood and asked me if I had any questions more than once I gained confidence and trusted his choice He is a rarity in any customer service these days He told me that customers are considered to be the backbone of a company What a fantastic attitude only a pity others don’t think the same way For once in a long time I wasn’t made to feel like an old aged pensioner nuisance and that takes a skill and respect I would recommend him any day He would make a good Training OfficerDefinitely an asset for O2 and should be recognised as such He should go far up the ladder Any company would be lucky to have him✈️ Thankyou Jay You are really appreciated You’re a credit firstly to yourself ✈️,2
"Had a bit of an issue with my phone and had difficulty explaining the situation over the phone as was quite tricky, i decided to go into the foyleside store where a young worker called Tom went above and beyond. Absolutely outstanding customer service.",2
I was on the phone to Alan Reeder from O2. My query was solved promptly and I learned new things about my data and tricks to sustain it. The man has amazing and rich knowledge. He deserves acknowledgment.,2
"I spoke with Sabrina today in 02 customer service and she was extremely helpful. After being hung up on numerous times, she was very informative and helped me resolve my issue. Thank you so much",2
"People only ever leave reviews when they’ve had a bad experience, but I just had a call with O2 which was a really nice experience, and I’d like to think that the person I spoke to will get some kind of recognition.I called 202 today and spoke to a man named Daryl about a PAC code. He was lovely, polite, very friendly and we were having a really nice chat in between all the actual work he had to do for me. I’m a very anxious person when it comes to ringing companies and speaking over the phone, but Daryl put me right at ease by simply talking and joking with me like a human being. I imagine his job sends a lot of angry people his way on a daily basis, so here is a bit of positivity, even if this review never reaches him.",2
l had ordered Samsung tablet from 02 app l had a faulty  tablet they said they would give me a replacement they were good very good service on the phone they said they would send it to the 02 shop,2
"After having purchased a new Apple Watch, I decided to use O2 as I have used them for numerous years. As usual, I was offered excellent service by the staff in the Northallerton branch, given exactly what I needed and given the service I expected. Having been an O2 customer for 20 years, everything was as expected.",2
"Top Top Top, Absolutely best phone shop ever, always helpful and best service, friendly staff. defiantly recommended. big thanks to Steve, Lewis, Amanda, Alisha and Fran for best service.",2
"I feel sad about some of the reviews I've seen on Trustpilot,as my experience with O2 has been nothing but positive.Whilst there are more competitive companies,I know where I stand with O2 and so far,touch wood,have not had any problems with the reception.I also had to contact customer service today,wasn't kept waiting for ages and spoke someone called Noxolo.Great customer service ,didn't feel rushed,extremely helpful and felt more reassured at the end of the call,thanks again Noxolo.I'm happy to pay what I am paying at the moment because I get what I pay for ,hence five stars.",2
"Can't believe these reviews are for same company that I've used on & off for many years. I had two lines but called to cancel one of them tonight. Jake was brilliant lovely guy, all sorted in no time.I've never once had any issues with O2 customer services and I've had experience of all the big companies. Plenty of bad issues with the others. I guess people are quicker to complain than praise.Keep up the good work guys, there are customers that appreciate you 😊",2
I would like to review  about  a girl Jyothi whom I just spoken now. Excellent care services over the phone supported me and solved my request. Great communication skills and  comforting words and consoling attitudes. Being tactile and been practical  solved mygenuine needs quickly. I wish her all the best and good luck for her life and carrier. Thank you Mary Paul. 🤩🤍🩷💕,2

I would like to thank Tom for his exceptional customer service and knowledge of his products.(Tom who sold me a phone as I believe there are two)All staff are very good in Haywards Heath store,2
"Switched to o2 via a comparison website for a cheaper sim deal.I had been with 3 for many years but in the last few, have had issues with network reception and calls cutting out, a new handset made no difference so it was time to move on.Switch over and transfer of my number was very easy to do, the only niggle I do have is, send a text or email with the date the change will take place, it was only on the off chance that I noticed emergency calls only and realised my old sim had been deactivated.Other than that, so far so good, no complaints with network reception at all and happy with my cheap deal.If anything changes, I will of course update my rating!",2
"Haleemah E - Customer Services:I recently moved over to O2 and Haleemah has been amazing helping me solve my queries she had answers to all my questions there was no hesitation or uncertainty from Haleemah, she gave me different solutions and the best advice! Honestly had been the best customer service I have experienced to date so thankful I got through to Haleemah I have never left a review but I was adamant to leave Haleemah a nice review just for appreciation as no one else was at all helpful or have a friendly attitude and they were not able to help just kept transferring me. Thank you Haleemah for your help this week!",2
"My a22 Samsung was constantly cutting me off. Went to upgrade to a23. Told to do it by phone because O2 shop couldn't access them due to imminent arrival of a24. Thought I had sorted it after 30 min call, assured they were in stock, chose colour and delivery date.  30 mins later email said out of stock despite offer still being shown as available on website. Immediately rang 02 to raise the issue with them [Sunday 19th March] Spoke to Gerry (Jerry) who took the time and patience to arrange an alternative phone having confirmed a23 was out of stock. He arranged for me to cancel the a23 order and stated he would ring me today [21/3/23] between 12 noon and 12.30pm. He rang me during that time slot as promised and sorted everything out to my complete satisfaction as well as supplying me with another tablet. Both products at a very reasonable price. Gerry in effect recovered the situation extremely well after the initial disappointment. Again he was polite, courteous, and took the time to explain everything in full, going the extra mile. He deserves recognition for this in turning what was going to a complaint into a positive outcome. Thank you.",2
"I have recently purchased a contract with o2, and had weeks worths of issues trying to port my old number across. During this time I have made multiple phone calls to the company but not been given a solution. Today, I called once again trying to resolve this issue and was attended by a very helpful, polite man named Muhammad. He was very understanding of the issue and tried to get it resolved as soon as possible. He explained thoroughly where the issue was coming from, and how it is going to be sorted. He is the only person to help with this issue and I am very pleased with the service.",2
"I came here 4 weeks ago to write a 1 star review as I thought my problem would never be resolved.I saw the volume of 1 star reviews and thought what's the point?I complained on an internal o2 survey and was booked in for a call.I completed the call with Chris this morning.I was listened to, I was understood and a solution was delivered that was more than acceptable. I just wanted my phone fixed. Now I am getting the broken one swapped out the next working day which brings 6 months of problems (with the manufacturer) to an end, thanks to O2.I am amazed. Relieved. Happy. Then remembered the volume of 1 star reviews and thought after the resolution they deserved some praise.Well done o2 for doing what you said you would do.",2
"So far so good. I was panicking after ordering & only then reading the reviews. But it's been better than expecting with 5g coverage, superb download & upload speeds. Well cheaper than rivals & still only 24month contracts.",2
Went to newtownards  store  and csa Adam could not do enough to solve my lost phone issue this chap is an absolute credit to 02 as he was quick  and nothing was to much hassle to him,2

The 02 in Kettering was a brilliant service when l ordered my Samsung galaxy watch 5 the assistant was very nice better than Wellingborough was a better service more welcoming,2
"Really happy with the customer service team at O2. I needed help with understanding the process of switching from an alternative provider to O2. A customer service team member, Frasel (apologies, I may have misspelt his name) went through the information very clearly with me today. He was helpful, personable and ensured I understood the terms and conditions of the contract. I know exactly what to expect of the contract and O2 have made a bright first impression to me now. Thank you!",2
"Together with my husband I visited 02 Mansfield, Four Seasons shopping Centre, 15/02/2023 not thinking that we would get our problem with 2 mobiles we had resolved. Therefore, we are delighted to report that Michalis, the 02 representative we met, was so patient and knowledgeable about the product, and it was sorted within 5 minutes, and deserving of this tribute.",2
"The only reason why i'm giving 02 a five star rating is because of one off their customer service advisors called Sean. I also experienced problems with my bill. They took payment from me 3 times for the same bill. When i first call up about the situation no one was taking me seriously until one day i call and was connected to an advisor call Sean. Sean was so helpful and helped me to get my money back and resolved the missing bill payment. I have read the other reviews and i'm not shocked, but there is good advisors working for 02 if your lucky enough to get through too one when you call up. Thanks once again Sean.",2

When we told O2 the customer service woman named ""Princess"" was very good at handling the situation and explained all prodecures carefully and calmly and kept us feeling at ease. This has really impressed me and made me feel confident in the O2 company. I am really blown away by Princess's service and hope that there would be many more like her.",2
Very happy with Kyle at the Mansfield O2 store.  I have been experiencing problems with SMSC texts.  His advise was very profesional and turned out to be spot on.,2
"I went to the Kidderminster store on Sunday, with my partner. His phone was completely damaged and he hadn’t long taken out the contract, with no insurance. The 3 staff there were super friendly and could see we were stressed, as the phone was needed for work the next day. Bradley was brilliant! He solved all our issues and we ended up with a new phone and cash back. I’ve never seen staff love their jobs more, they were so hyped about O2 benefits, it really made our worry disappear. Such a lovely environment, I’ve never experienced this before. What a brilliant team! Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2
"As an existing customer, I was exploring options for using my phone in Canada.

I was in store and was doing switch upConnor from the Ballymena store took time and helped me the best he can and listened to me blabbering. He advised about the Samsung 20 days of Christmas I just praise everything he has done to help me.,2
I visited o2 branch in Fulham Broadway and was served by 2 members of staffJoyce and Amanda both of who were extremely knowledgable and helpful - excellent customer care!,2
"Superb network, no issue at all always been the best  ￼",2
"Moved to a £8/month SIM-Only deal during the Black Friday sales. I was pleasantly surprised to see my 30gb unlimited text and calls deal doubled because I'm also a Virgin Media customer. £8 for 60GB data and I can roam for free, what a cracking deal. The port over from my O2 business SIM could have been better but we'll worth the money.",2
"UPDATE: Awesome service. Take it to the CEO. Our issue was dealt with very promptly by the CEO. We received a credit for the bad service, and they unlocked our phone free.EXISTING COMPLAINT: Wowsers. Lazy incompetent staff. Entered one of the o2 branches and not joking you, there were 4 or 5 members all sitting down. NONE of them got up to greet me and my husband. Apparently, my husband's number is not in the system, yet they are taking £20 per month from my husband's account. Such unhelpful people. Couldn't care less whether my husband has been a loyal member of o2 for over a decade and just told us to do everything online at o2.",2
All the people in the Northampton store were so helpful today. They went above and beyond to help when I had a slight emergency with my phone.Very impressed.,2
"I had issues regarding my network connection, unable to call, text or use my data.With the help of Angel from on the O2 live chat he was able to answer my questions and help me out pretty swiftly.Turned out to be not O2’s fault.Wrote this review to thank Angel really, because the solution disconnected the live chat.Appreciate your help lad.",2
"O2 please give your good man Will in sales a pay rise, he is an exceptional attribute to your company and because of him I’d tell everyone I know to join o2 he’s completely made my year maybe you should give him a paid month of for Christmas for his good work he deserves it !!",2
Thank you Rueben for sorting that out for me! 02 had taken too much money and the salesperson did not know anything and could not resolve it I was frustrated! After talking to Rueben he resolved it all in 4 mins and I was credited £50 to my account just like that big up to this man he is customer focused and polite and listens to customers frustration thank you again Rueben your the man,2
Always decent renewal offers on. Good customer service via phone too.,2
"Excellent so far, moved three contracts from Vodafone to O2 and couldn't be happier.",2
"All my PAYG credit had disappeared and the top up card machine at my local garage kept saying ""Invalid Product Config"" whatever that means.  Got through to Customer Service within three minutes (!) and the chap I spoke to was loud and clear.  He quickly identified the problem as the settings on my new phone, he rang me back on my landline and talked me through resetting my new phone.  He then spoke to his manager and restored most of my lost phone credit. Brilliant, if only all customer service was like this.  Thank you M.....",2
"All good so far. Reception has improved over the years as ten years ago I couldn’t get any signal at my house, now get 2 or 3 bars. Got good deal for new phone, 30gb and unlimited texts and calls for £23. Signed up to airtime rewards using code E977QRRT and nearly up to £10 off this months bill",2
"I’ve been with 02 UK for years and I cant fault them. They send me an email every month with my bill total which usually doesn’t vary much unless I make some calls when I’m on holiday in the US or wherever. No fuss, amount taken by Direct Debit and no unwanted junk mail by email or post.  A very happy customer.",2
"excellent customer service, benefits/rewards and phone coverage. I have been with o2 since I was 13 as a child on a family plan and now 6 years on my own account every year they seem to get better and offer more. I recently changed contract and thought I should leave a review as customer service in the UK is disgusting at the moment but o2 seems to have got it right!as someone that travels a lot out of the Eu, they are excellent and have always been reasonable.",2
"I had run out of data and telephoned O2 for advice and help.  I was dealt with in a very professional manner, asking about my O2 preferences and informing me of certain contractual arrangements.  I spoke to three customer advisors, but only have the name of the first, who was David.  He said that, after thoroughly explaining various aspects of the contract, that he would send a new SIM out to me.  He was patients and professional - thank you.All those who helped me were very good - Ta!",2
Although having being lied to and the phone put down on me I wanted to give some feedback to Saira in the South African office. Honestly she was a pleasure to deal with. She listened to my problem and sorted it within a few minutes. Her can do attitude and efficiency in dealing with my prolem should be commended. Please pass my thanx to her and make sure her managers are aware. She has restored my faith with O2.,2
This 5 star review is for the Customer Service Agent called Temoor.  He was bloomin fantastic. He went above and beyond to help me with my upgrade as I had been on the phone for over half an hour being fobbed off by 3/4 other customer service people.  He is a credit to your company and you should give him the reward he deserves. Thank you Temoor. You Sir are a legend.,2
"I popped in the Poole store today and spoke with Jake, unfortunately for Jake he had me as the customer, I am not tech savvy one bit. He was the most helpful and patient advisor that i have come across in retail for years. He was still friendly and smiling on my 4th visit of the day, and still very happy to answer my queries and questions. He is a credit to O2, keep hold of him!",2
"Davino thank you , for giving me extra data when I really needed it.and thank you to Armenia for her help this morning. I have been with 02 for years and have only ever had polite efficient customer service assistants.  Thank you very much.",2
"I do believe I've written a previous review of my experience with o2 Mobile.  It was a favourable review and related to my use of the o2 Pay As you Go service.I recently requested an upgrade from PAYG to a Pay monthly 'SIM only' service with of a 4gb monthly allowance and unlimited calls and texts. This is costing me £6 a month.Again I have to report that the transition was completely free of any sort of hiccup or glitch. Everything went smoothly and efficiently and the three call centre advisors ( Sana and Channel and Vanessa) to whom I spoke when setting up the new account were absolutely fine - one was operating from the UK call centre and the other two were in the South Africa call centre and the call quality was fine.  All were helpful and well informed and, where appropriate, kept their promises regarding calling me back etc.I honestly have no complaints at all. However the vast majority of reviewers here have other thoughts on the matter and I must conclude that it's time o2 did something to address this dreadful situation where so very many people are NOT satisfied.",2
"Seen so many negative reviews of O2, so wanted to at least offer some light from my own personal experience. I can't speak for the various stores across the country, but the Mansfield O2 store have always been occupied by friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. I know that 5G network is still a work in progress for areas like mine, but do find that I've linked up to a 5G signal quite regularly so can enjoy their speeds. When I moved to my previous house, I was with EE, where I had pretty bad signal, so eventually got to change over to O2 whose signal was spot on. Where I live now is abit of a black spot for other networks at times, but O2 signal is so reliable for me and apart from the odd maintenance work on the local mast, had no issues with connectivity. Every issue I have had, which is extremely infrequent to be honest has been resolved so quickly. I was recently overcharged on my bill due to my phone linking to a Turkish network whilst in Greece (also one of the only networks that still offer free EU roaming), they admitted that there was an error and was quick to resolve the issue and refund me the amount I had been overcharged. I genuinely can't say enough good words about their service.",2
I had a big issue yesterday as i was moving over to O2 and all my children as well. My old provider didn’t allow the number to move easily on time then i had to travel to Chester with my old SIM which stopped went to Chester O2 shop Jack was absolutely brilliant he helped me even though his boss was reluctant to help meThen i had an issue as mistakenly the Sim Jack gave me was registered for my daughter’s number who is on her own at uni and suddenly didn’t have any service I rang customer services and that was best experience ever LORITA from customer service went above and beyond to sort out my problem got my daughter’s mobile working again and mine working with my number she promised to ring me when i get all details needed and she did contact me not only once but several times if all O2 customer services are of that level like Lorita this company should be rated the best please thank her on my behalf,2
Wouldn’t want to be on any other network. I have had contracts with o2 since 2015 and the customer experience has always been better than any other for me. In 2020 i switched to vodafone as they offered a cheap contract on a phone. But i always had too many problems with them. As soon as i switched back I haven’t had any problems free eu roaming is a massive plus. 4g coverage is perfect for where i am. 5g isn’t really available but i can forgive that considering the speeds i get on 4g. Customer service are always helpful and 9 times out of 10 i will have my problem solved within 1 call. The customer services team are helpful and polite. All in all just a positive customer experience,2
"Just wanted to say a big thank you to Elizabeth from Yorkshire! When opting to leave o2 I had tried so many times to leave but it kept getting pro longed and always cut off. However Elizabeth walked me through all my options is a great manor and ended my time with o2 with a smile as she was so wonderful, polite and helped so much. So thank you Elizabeth company’s need more of you!",2
Visited your Westwood Cross shop to buy my father in law a phone. This is his first foray into the internet and smart phone. Which isn’t an easy thing to do as an 83 year old. The service he received was excellent with the assistant explaining the difference between monthly and pay as you go. He suggested the oppo A16 as a good ‘first time’ smart phone which was what he opted for in the end. He explained everything to my father-in-law in layman’s terms that he could understand. He chose the phone  they had recommended and left happy.,2
"My experience with the 02 store in Peterborough, Queensgate, was fantastic. Everyone presented themselves in a calm and friendly manner, and I felt welcome to ask any questions. The service I received was above and beyond, I am really grateful particularly to Shakk who went out of his way to provide me with the detailed information on the contract I wanted to upgrade to- but also in transferring data from my old phone. The Peterborough 02 team provided an excellent service for me and I'd recommend this company to all.",2
This 5 stars is only because of the help I received from Julia from customer service she has been very helpful and deserves a raise cannot thank her enough for the help give her a promotion or something lol,2
"After previous bad experiences with o2, I must say I have just had nothing short of an outstanding experience with callum with in the retentions team. If it was not for this man, I would not still be with o2. Although I was his last call of the day, not once was he rushing me, but he was extremely polite, very helpful and made me feel very well taken care of and heard, as well as seeming very knowledgeable and he took the time to answer any questions I had with no issue at all! For this, I must say, outstanding service.",2
"O2 and of course Virgin are one of the great companies that have kept free EU roaming! As long as you keep EU roaming going, I can see you potentially driving all these greedy networks like 3, Vodafone, EE, Voxi and Tesco (to date) out of business. How on earth they can expect to keep customers in the future is just beyond me. They're just taking advantage of Brexit as they aren't bound by EU law anymore. Nothing but cooperate greed!Keep it up o2! Providing you continue offering free EU roaming, all these other greedy networks are fast going to be losing customers and potentially go bust. Your gain is their loss!!!",2
"I was having problems with setting up my phone with the new sim, this was part of a new contract with Virgin Media and their ammended service. I was unable to get through to the 02 call centre so went to our local store at Teesside Park. I was helped there by Danielle. She was professional, helpful and friendly. My problem was resolved quickly and I was given help and further information to prevent further problem. I would use this store in future because of the help I received.",2
Great deal I had with them and so happy with ethic support team!,2
"Love o2!Used to love three mobile, but I moved to o2 and now I am in love. You can use your phone all over london no dropping of calls plus the battery my phone lasts twice as long dump three come to o2",2
"I've been with Sky mobile, Vodafone, EE, GiffGaff and Lebara - o2 has been by far, the best choice!Let me tell you why it's been a game changer for me.• I'm with Virgin so can take advantage of VOLT (double data and upgraded broadband for FREE)• Highly competitive if you explore uSwitch, I pay only £8 for 20GB data (which is now 40GB cause of VOLT on 2 sim only plans)• o2 priority app - FREE coffee, who doesn't like a free coffee from Greggs?• App is fairly well made in comparison to other competitors• Customer Service has been great, compared to experiences with all of the above providers• Signal is fantastic, not as good as EE but EE is way more expensive and you get less value for money• FREE data usage when travelling abroad in their Europe Zone (the only major provider that does NOT charge)This is why o2 are a fantastic providers to be with!",2
Not impressed at all with 02 and thank god I am with EE. Went to a shop today to support my elderly mother. The young man couldn't have been more unhelpful if he tried. My mother will now be leaving 02,2
"Professional customer service. I recently made the mistake to move from O2 because I got a better deal from someone else.It was only once I had to deal with the complete incompetence of this other provider that I realised how efficient O2's customer service team are.I have now returned and will not make the same mistake again. Thank you O2 customer service team. I think you are based in South Africa (based on the accent) and could not be more friendly, bright and helpful.",2
"I am not an 02 customer and had my details used to create an account. I did not notice till 3 months into service of the account.(Yeah I should keep an eye on my account but working nights on a covid ward kinda makes that mission.)But the service, understanding and being listened to was outstanding.The lady was fast efficient and made me feel she/the company were there for me even though I am not their customer.I was on the phone for less than 10-15 mins  the auto selection took longer to get through than my actual business.EE,Vodafone,3 take note this lady is the kinda service team you need to have.Santana R you are a credit to your company and the service.Thank you.Santana thank you 02.",2
"I have had the best customer service ever by a staff member named Jade at the upgrade/ retention department at 02She went above and beyond to ensure I upgraded at  price thats suitable for my needs. I cannot thank her enough!she was very patient, understanding and supportive.",2
Vikram from 02 has been so helpful regarding my phone. In some aspect I have been made a victim and he’s been helpful/patient with my particular case. It’s good to have someone of his level of understanding.,2
"I can see many reviews about issues but my experience with o2 has been very smooth and issue free thus far. I have had my number with them for over a decade and I have not had issues getting through to speak to anyone, always very helpful and very polite.",2
"Doncaster Frenchgate branch.Outstanding service today from James and Ross this morning, from entering the shop  to upgrade my phone.They're knowledge was second to none and gave us superb customer care.After being told by another mobile company that you have lost thousands of precious photos etc Ross retrieved everything and I'm just so grateful.Total credit to the company !  Thanks guys.",2
I wrote a review a couple of days ago about customer service I have recieved from o2 but today I spoke with a lady called Ruquiyah who listened to what I said & spoke to me with me with respect & resolved a problem I've tried to solve for over a year & half ( THANK YOU Ruquiyah ). They should give you a promotion thanks again for all your hard work. 😉😄😃,2
I have to say.my experience in the Hartlepool 02 shop was brilliant.Tim who dealt with us was so helpful and I must say he is a credit to 02.He gave us advice on the phones me and my husband wanted.also he sorted changing us from sky to virgin.thanks once again tim.definetly recommend him if anyone needing a new phone .his customer service is outstanding,2
"Sam in 02 recycle was both kind & understanding. He listened to my issue, looked into my case & promptly dealt with it correctly as I had done nothing to damage my handset in any way. It really helps when people like Sam work @ 02. Thank you so much.",2
"Just got off the phone to Customer Services regarding an issue I had with my Pay as You Go Sim. The call was answered very promptly and the issue was resolved by Marcelle there and then. Marcelle was very understanding, helpful and cheerful. I couldn't fault her service and if I every need to call back again I home I get through to her as she made the whole interaction very pleasant.",2
Hi there - I called 202 and I just wanted to commend your CSA Connor for great customer service. Many thanks & keep up the good work.👍,2
"There are lots of bad reviews of o2 on here, but I think that they are great by comparison, as I have just come from BT.",2
"I find O2 very good with their customer services and mobile offers, my signal yet as to hit a black spot which it has not, I’m able to make calls where some mobile companies cannot get signals.",2
Don’t know why everyone’s submitting bad reviews as I’ve had nothing but a positive experience with o2 the last 10 years. They offer great extras such as the Virgin Media Volt On (Double data and speed) and discount for employees of NHS and other companies through o2 OPEN. Would highly recommend to anyone. Just did o2 Refresh with Donna from customer service and received great service!,2
"Regardless of the many negative reviews, I have personally never had an issue with them. Phones arrive the following day if ordered before midnight and their CS team has always been helpful when I've needed them.It seems as long as you pay your bill you'll never have an issue.In an age fuelled by entitlement and expectations of compensation for the smallest of inconveniences i can't help but wonder if a lot of these negative reviews are warranted",2
I've been with O2 for many years. I don't understand all the negative reviews. Maybe I'm lucky but they've always been very helpful with me. Customer service is always excellent.,2
"Quick service, was shown how to use and what I needed. Great thank you.",2
I’ve today ordered a new line with o2… so far amazing. I’m fully aware on costings now and the future and look forward to a great experience at o2… where as at another provider.. remain nameless decide to bully threaten and totally destory customers mental health. I’m looking forward to Being with 02… and as soon as I can… move all my lines over from old provider to too,2
Lovely customer service don’t know why the bad reviews amazing experience,2
Excellent service from Mohammed on customer service assisting me on upgrading my phone and getting the best deal. Thank you for your time and effort Mohammed!,2
"My contract came to an end recently, after speaking on the phone with Sarah Witham from customer services she was really helpful and managed to get me a really good deal on a sim only contract. I am happy to be staying with O2 for another 12 months!",2
"Great company been with them 12 years now and renewing is easy, I have my mother and sons account with mine too. Reasonable price increases YOY considering the climate.",2
"I have just visited White Rose 02 store Leeds and met Khaliq. He has patiently helped my 83 year old father in law move his sim package from an Android to a mobile and set up his Apple ID when he couldn’t today get this working. He was polite, patient, kind and encouraging. A real credit to your company 02 and above all a very important role model for what customer service should be. Thank you so much .",2
"Massive thanks to Shane and Alisha in the Workington store! We received AMAZING customer service from you both today. You went above and beyond to ensure we got everything we needed. Two new iPhones and an iPad all up and running in no time with our data transferred too. It was a pleasure dealing with you, you’re both a credit to O2. Thank you!",2
Am praising the staff Lee and Ashley at Macclesfield O2 shop. They were very helpful and professional after a few calls unable to understand on the call centre. We had just taken out a newer contract with Virgin Media which included a new Sim but it was made very complicated to a Silver Surfer until the Macc staff sorted it out .Thanks for giving me back my sanity x,2
"I have been an o2 customer for over 8 years now, have never had any problems with them. Unfortunately due to losing my job due to ill health, I was unable to pay my bill in full resulting in my services being cut off. I spoke with a member of the finance team, and I’m annoyed at myself for not getting his name, I was upset, embarrassed and slightly emotional! This guy went out of his way to calm me down, was kind, understanding and compassionate and went out of his way to help me in any way he could. His kind words went a long way on a bad day, a customer experience I will never forget! Thankyou",2
"Today After only awaiting a short time , spoke to a fellow Yorkshire person whom is working hard from home for O2.  Lovely lady, we understood every word from her , she explained everything and made sure we understoodand clarified every detail with a friendly, helpful attitude.  Thank you Katie . STAR *****",2
"At the start of my issue. This was  regarding not carrying over of data I had paid for but never used (even though I explained at point of contract I was not in the U.K. for six months and had a Spanish contract for then  ) I would have given only 1 star on here .But then, in all businesses there is a decent and reliable human being who listens and wants to help as best they can. Enter Customer Rep Michaela Wilkinson. Absolutely brilliant and took me from wanting to leave O2 after over 20 years of loyal service to being so impressed it would be indecent of me to change.I’m early retired now but used to be a high level business consultant and I keep filling in the O2 surveys of how they have so many things wrong and hence such a low trust pilot score .The solution is always in front line people (not auto assistants) who have the ability to help and recognise customer loyalty .So this 5 star goes to Michaela Wilkinson on behalf of O2.",2
My daughter ran bill up and they cut it off.they sent me a letter saying I recevie the final bill in few weeks next letter in was a debt collector one I ran 02 and explained and no bother at all recalling it back.i ran back today and got a payment plan in order they were so helpful and understanding couldn't do enough.,2
I would like to thank Ashley at Stockport 02 for sorting my phone problem out ware other stores could not also for being so kind and pleasant 👍,2
"My mum received shocking care from the Taunton branch but THANKFULLY the Bath branch took such great care of her. The managers name I didn’t catch a blonde lady but the gentleman who assisted me and my mum Jourdan has not only excellent customer care, but a real kindness and helped us for well over an hour despite this being another stores mammoth cock up! He was brilliant with my mum who isn’t tech savvy at all and helped massively to get her phone working and her confidant. I hope staff receive good feedback as the bath branch on the 3rd feb 2022 we’re everything a company should be proud of.",2
"Fantastic customer service always received. No overly long waiting times over the phone and sending links to speak to customer service online, unlike one I won't mention. No problems whatsoever during the duration of my contract. So I give five stars.",2
I would just like to say thank you to O2For always offering the best deals but most importantly the O2 priority app.I work for the NHS in the community and there's nothing better than being treated with a free hot drink per week between visits. It honestly means the world to me and makes my day!The cinema tickets are equally rewarding and makes a Monday evening not feel so bad and something to look forward too.Thank you for all that you are offering!!,2
I went to the 02 store in Cleveleys  near Blackpool yesterday for a new contract phone. A young lad called Gaz helped guide me through the different phones on offer within my budget. I felt the need to write this as his customer service skills were amazing. It’s not often nowadays you get a friendly face. But for about 1 hour I had a really nice enjoyable experience within the store from this young lad who was quite new to this job. Training has obviously gone well. So I’d like to say Thankyou & well done team 02 he’s going to do well will make sure to see you next time Gaz 😊,2
"Looking at all these bad reviews I'm quite surprised. I recently upgraded my mobile and was ill advised by a consultant and was signed up with less benefits than was agreed on the phone.Up steps Deborah 'W' who I have to say has surpassed any customer service advisor I have ever cone across. She corrected the previous advisors mistake and spent ages talking through a solution with me.Never have I been told I would be called back and actually receive a call until now. 4 calls in fact. Everything Deborah said she would ring, she rang on the dot. Even a courtesy call that wasn't scheduled.I hope this review gets to the right people within O2 and and Deborah gets to read this. She's a super starHappy customer",2
"This review is based on service received by agent Vasudev on o2 Customer Service Webchat. Vasudev went out of his way to try and resolve a 48 hour DPD delivery delay on my new Iphone. After numerous calls and chats to both DPD and o2 getting nowhere I was at breaking point; stress levels through the roof. He was friendly, very helpful and empathised with my situation. He tried everything possible to try and get my delivery sorted, after DPD kept lying and coming up with various excuses. Though unable to get them to deliver to me the same day that they had promised, (the day after it was initially supposed to arrive, for which I had paid a premium), it did turn up the following morning (3rd day) first thing. I truly believe that had it not been for Vasudev`s intervention and pulling out all the stops to get my order delivered, that I would still be waiting and stressing over where it was and if it was ever going to arrive. Thank you Vasudev. I really appreciate all your efforts. May God bless you and your family.",2
"I have been with Tesco which uses 02 for 10 years and have always had a good reception for calls in that time.  I have broadband at home and mostly use the internet there but at the times that I needed to use internet on my phone outside, I have never found an issue.  I am in Folkestone Kent. I only found that they had bad reviews because I was looking at other providers because Tesco's isn't such good value at the moment and from my point of view, I think they are good provider.",2
"I always find it amazing to see so many negative reviews. I’ve been with O2 for about 9 or 10 years now, and whilst there have been issues, they have always resolved them quickly.Most recently, I upgraded my series 6 Apple Watch Product (red) to a series 7, using O2 Refresh. There was an issue with the website’s stock locator, so I rang the Metro Centre store, confirmed stock, and popped down.I had previously had an issue adding my data plan to a watch, which required O2 to reset everything, and they did that fine for me. Because of that, I set up my watch in store just in case and they were there to help in case it failed, which it didn’t.Wife and I both on O2, definitely offers some of best coverage in the north east of England. I know this because I did switch to Vodafone for a week because when I was due an upgrade they had a deal on, but they had no network at home, or work, or in Huddersfield where I regularly travel. I got a unlimited data sim from Three for my iPad, and that’s slower than O2.I guess every company has their issues and spends on who you get for support, but I’ve found o2 to be an excellent network and I can see myself moving any time soon.",2
I got a new SIM card ten years ago because I'm weird and I change my number every day (and also like false economy s) now ten years on and forty Sims later I need my number to log in to get a tax rebate and they obliged  spoke to a wonderful gentleman on the phone great service,2
I’ve been with o2 for around 15 years now and I’ve never had any problems with them. I’ve just upgraded early to the new iPhone with no hassle and didn’t have any problems with my first ever phone contract with them 2 years ago (I was always sim only and pay as you go before that) delivery is always on time. :) I think I’ll stick around for another while.,2
"Served by Rachael,O2 leicester Beaumont leys store.I bought a new phone on contract and left ID mobile.She explained plan clearly, bills, insurance and made us feel welcomed.Thank you RachaelMr Fletcher",2
"I went to o2 Beaumont store and got served by a lovely lady called Rachael. She is amazing, professional in the manner she speaks. She explained everything clearly and very polite and beautiful. Thank you Rachael for making my experience beautiful. I will visit the store often with friends and family. You are a rare gem and a credit to O2. Angela😍",2
"I would recommend 02, as there value for money and they reward their customers.When you take out a contract with them you get access to 02 priority, ie freebies each week like free coffee and food",2
"Excellent service from 02 shop in Yeovil. Answered my query, fixed the issue I was having within 5 minutes, and with very pleasant, polite service. Highly recommended. Thanks!",2
Called in O2 shop in Nuneaton on Sunday for advice on replacement phone. The chap was the most helpful of any O2 shop we have been in. His customer service was exceptional and this prompted us to buy a phone. Nothing was too much trouble and he even checked which day he was next in just in case we had any problem. He deserves to go far.,2
Spoke to Terrence over the phone from Glasgow. He understood my situation and didn't just seem like an advisor who was just doing his job. He went above and beyond to help and naturally seemed like a person who cared about peoples situation. I got the help and more from that phone call - people who care make a big difference. Keep up the good work Terrence!,2
My own experience has actually been really good with 02. I live in North Cornwall and switched from three because of no to sketchy signal.at homeHad a new mate 20 pro comtract £20 a month (4gig plus unlimited) thought that was very competitive.Still got the phone but went to £6 month sim only (6gig plus unlimited) the changover was seamless and correct and the coverage for me is excellent,2
I went into O2 store in Swan Centre Eastleigh as I was out of contract with my phone.   The staff were brilliant and Graham dealt with the transfer of info from the old phone to the new phone.   Graham was very knowledgeable and was extremely helpful and friendly.  Matt who we have dealt with previously was warm and welcoming.  It was a pleasure to go into the store and have such good customer service.  Well done O2 from a very grateful customer.,2
"We are a couple of seniors who have just acquired our first ever smartphone, choosing 02 as our provider.  They have a system of a 'guru' in post at each shop, to guide ingenues like us, so we booked an appointment with James, the Oxford Westgate Centre Guru.  We were not disappointed.  James answered all our picayune questions with expert patient ease.  At the end of our long session, we felt confident about using the phone.  What an excellent idea:  having a Resident Guru.  And thank you, James.",2
"My father had an accident and Louise from Gateshead Metro Centre was fantastic.   She looked after my mother, called me, supported my mam whilst the ambulance arrived.   I can’t thank your amazing team member enough.   Thank you",2
"I had a very serious complaint against a man working in an O2 store, who made me and my partner feel incredibly uncomfortable, committed fraud and then put me in debt with O2. I called a line today, and was put through to a young man called Steven. Honestly, a call I was dreading was made simple, and I felt cared for, by that lovely man. He absolutely made me feel listened to, he took his time with my complaint, and called me back to tell me there was an investigation going on and I will be updated every step of the way. Honestly, this man is a credit to the company. If you're getting all these bad reviews about customer service, yet I had a very pleasant one even with a very hard topic... he's a great one! Thank you Steven if you're reading this, you're a credit to the company you work for.",2
"I am confused by other reviews.  I had a difficult problem dealt with initially by 'chat'; I was advised to pursue resolution by talking to the relevant department. Everyone was polite, friendly and efficient and the problem was resolved with no difficulty.  It was taking some time so I was advised to 'ring off' and I would be called back.  That was what happened in a short time frame.  In brief a 5* experience",2
"Sab, Olly & Flick at the Clifton Down store were all absolutely amazing. So lovely to chat to, and crazy helpful. I got so frustrated with the online services live chat, but as soon as I got in store they took the time to explain what had happened and how to rectify it. Got me a lovely new phone, with a comfortable chat and no extreme upselling; they seemed very genuinely interested in helping me get the phone I needed. Thanks so much gang!",2
"Reading the reviews is insane. Been with o2 for 3 years, contract ran out as paid my phone off and switched onto another o2 contract, all went fine.I have also just bought a new phone for my daughter for xmas and all was easy peasy there too.The app is fantastic. You get airtime rewards. So for example, I add my debit card and whenevr I shop at say primark or greggs ect money comes off my bill. Great for a teenager too which is why I've now got her on the same :)Looking at some reviews it seems some people are complaining about their own errors. Example, leaving o2 in contract is always going to be an issue for any network, signal is always going to be an issue in some areas, not really o2s fault, just get over it until you move to a new location, people complaining about paying a high monthly cost out of contract, well how is that there fault, ensure you keep an eye on your contract when it runs out change it so its lower or get a new contract, simple...",2
Had a great experience in woolwich O2- Yamin made the process of upgrading my phone super easy and helped me to find the exact deal I wanted. Couldn't have wished for better service!,2
"I have been with O2 since I owned the iPhone 4S (the good ol' days). Since then I have owned several handsets with O2, either by taking out a deal with them directly or by signing up for a new deal through a third party such as Carphone Warehouse.I can honestly say that I have never experienced a single problem with this provider during my tenure with them. I have contacted them on several occasions with general queries, switching mobile numbers etc. and each time has been a breeze (I mainly used webchat).Recently I have switched to another network, only because I now work for said network and receive quite a hefty discount.There are quite a lot of complaints regarding this network, either on Trust Pilot or social media, but the same complaints apply to each and every network. Everyone has their own viewpoint or issue with a network, big or small. You may go to another network such as EE and have a wonderful experience, or leave EE and join O2 because you've have a dreadful experience. You can't please everyone I suppose!I will undoubtedly be returning to O2 in the future I'm sure.",2
"Purchased an IPhone 13 pro online at Vodafone… the next day I got a text saying they were out of stock.. waited 2 weeks but still nothing.. ended up cancelling the order.I also went into Manchester to the apple Store and they had none either. Searched around everywhere.Finally, went to my current provider (O2) and was amazed that their website had them as ‘in stock’… I ordered it and was expecting a ‘we’re sorry’ email but was amazed that they said they’d deliver it the next day… and they did.. great customer service. One happy customer… data rates are a bit higher than most but other than that.. brilliant!",2
I had a guy from the Burnley store his name began with a Z and he sorted me a phone out within one working day it was my first contract and I had no clue what I was doing he was amazing and so helpful I can’t praise him enough! He also helped my partner know about how much he had left on his contractHe helped me decide what plan and what phone would be suitable for me,2
I've been with O2 about 8 years now. I always have great service from them. Would recommend.,2
Excellent service and customer careI joined O2 last week and my new sim card arrived 2 days later.  The sim activated immediately and I was up and running straight away.  My old number was ported 2 days later and the whole operation was seamless.  10/10 o2 for such an efficient operation.  I called customer care to check on my old number porting and they couldn’t have been more helpful.  Having suffered at the hands of Virgin mobile for 6 weeks this is a welcome relief and I cannot recommend o2 highly enough.,2
"I have to say a big thank you to 02, have been a client for as long as I can remember and they have never let me down. Customer service is second to none, this morning they guided me to a different plan and I am more than grateful.",2
"Would highly recommend O2 Insurance! I have had my phone for 3 years and never had to claim but typically a week before I had paid off my phone I dropped it and the whole screen was cracked. The Insurance team were brilliant, very reassuring and talked me through all my options whilst being very supportive - they told me I could get my phone collected at my door and a replacement delivered the next day and this is exactly what happened - SO SO SIMPLE! Have had to jump through hoops to claim on insurance before and this was so simple and easy during a stressful time, thank you!",2
"Been with O2 for many years. Any issue raised such as no signal was easily raised and sorted out within 48hrs, along with updates along the way.The app is easy to use, able to pay the montly bill early if needed or easily upgraded to a new plan.",2
"Got a 02 sim contract,I'm still very unhappy with them,but I'm giving them 5 star, im a Vodafone customer been very happy with them. But switched to 02 just to see how they are, still 6 month and still need to wait for a phone contract  With Vodafone just 3 month and they offered me a phone contract. I didn't check the reviews before I switch to 02. Now I'm seeing so many negative reviews for 02. I'm still thinking to stay with 02 or to switch to another network.",2
Shaun and Travis were so helpful when there was an issue changing from PAYG to contract. They valued my time and were on the ball how to help. Issue all fixed quickly!,2
Where do I even start? The customer service from Brian King was fantastic and went above and beyond for myself. Explained my entire situation gave me fantastic advice all the way through reassuring me everything will be ok! Talked me through everything completely and set me a new plan. I hope o2 have more Brian’s because the customer service will excel with individuals such as him.I got confused a few times and he was so polite and professional from start to finish ensuring I was happy. Not only that it’s helped me keep in contact with my daughter whom I’m awaiting important hospital appointments for. Brian took above and beyond to a new level and can’t thank him enough!I hope o2 have a reward scheme because if he’s the same to me as every customer something is being done correct by him and deserves recognition!Thank you Brian and thank you for your outstanding customer service.10/10 for everything,2
"Fantastic customer service from Karen Boardman. Gave great advice. Although I am a little sad because I reported an aesthetic impairment with the handset during the warranty and it wasn't logged sufficiently, the kindness was wonderful. We cannot take our frustrations out on customer service representatives because they are front line and deal with most of the back office's mistakes of mismanagement and lack of organisation. I really hope I am offered a good deal on my new contract to compensate for the devices issues, however, in future I will return to this representative because she is an asset to this company. <3 Melanie",2
"Noticed yesterday that I had been charged for text messages from Premium number for the past 3 months and not even received them in my message box. Phoned 02 customer services and the lady was so professional, reassuring and helpful that she put my mind at rest. Don't come across such caring people very often. Thank you",2
I had a very pleasant experience speaking to a lady named Jackie from the O2 Business customer service team. She went above and beyond to help resolve my issue and was very polite and kind whilst doing so.,2
"I needed to contact a specific team in O2, I found the details on the website. Sent my email with the details, received the automatic reply saying they aim to reply in 5 days but due to current demand it may take longer.  It did take longer, but as they resolved this was no issue for me. I had a call today from the team at O2. He explained what he had done, gave advice, was polite and friendly. Thank you.",2
"Went to 02 in Westfield, Stratford was only enquiring about the Samsung Z fold, phone as well as the S7 Plus tablet, the young girl Tejiri, gave me the information needed about the monthly cost as well as upfront cost, and the total cost through the 48 month period. It was not busy at around just before 1 pm, so was seen straight away, without any waiting. Service was professional and no complaints.",2
"Switched to O2 this week and I am extremely pleased with the experience.  The O2 advisors were helpful when I had a little difficulty porting my existing number and sorted the whole thing out for me.  So far, a great service and about the cheapest too.",2
John was a pleasure to speak with and gave me the price and peace if mind for 24 months.,2
"A big complement to O2. After creating a chaos in ""MyO2"" account, they not only solved this in minutes, a much, much, better deal and a new sim card within a day. Next day in the Netherlands, within 2 minutes roaming on and full internet.  Thanks O2 team, well done.",2
I was speaking to a lovely lady Gill this morning and she went beyond more to help me and I'm ever so greatfull.,2
Been a loyal customer with o2 for several years- can find everything you need through the app. Had no real problems at all with customer service.I love the priority app too!,2
"I didn’t receive my sim as planned via post and decided to pop down to my local O2 store in Evesham this afternoon. I wish I had asked for her name as she provided me with such lovely customer service and spent time talking to me about the latest Apple Watch (as I am an avid Apple user!). Thankyou so much, I really appreciate all the help given.",2
"Had the best experience with o2 customer services. Joined they're network briefly to buy a specific phone. Once my 14 days passed, called to cancel my contract. Unfortunately they misunderstood what I meant, and charged me an extra month. Called to confirm my cancellation and they were kind, really friendly and refunded me the extra month they charged by mistake.I'm sticking to my current network, as I prefer my pay as you go provider, but I absolutely appreciated the easiness of sorting out my cancellation",2
"I've been with O2 for a few years now. I use services (which O2 provides me with) at O2 branch in Essex, Southend-on-sea (The High Street) This is the place I'd like to give my feedback on.You will be greated with positive energy and smile there.Your concerns/issues will be listened.The best possible option will be offered which suits you best.Your needs will be met.This is the place, where you feel looked after.So without any hesitation, I give 5 stars out of 5My big personal and exceptional ""Thank you"" to the manager of this O2 branch.Thank youYours sincerely,Dr.Asta Galentiene",2
Very happy with my call from Shantal as she very clearly explained what had happened with my discount and then applied for it to be out on for me!,2
"I bought an iPhone 8 from a reputable refurbished phone shop and went to my local 02 shop in Sittingbourne to get a sim only deal, the young lady then pointed out that the phone I had purchased was working correctly but it had a repaired screen that was incorrectly fitted and would probably fail if knocked so she then accompanied me to the retailer and returned the phone and I came away with an A grade iPhone 7 which is immaculate and after transferring all my contacts etc. sent me on my way - this was a very good example of going out of her way to help an old codger into the 21st century for which I am extremely grateful.",2
Shaheen was a huge help after the online messaging could not help AT ALL. The online service would not accept that I only had one phone and all my service were completely cut off. They still insisted (despite living alone and just coming out of isolation) that I had to find another phone and call.But then I ran to someone who thankfully lent me their phone and let me sort this out.And Shaheem happened! He was patient and naturally frustrated with endless complaints and anger and dealt with me so well and got me my services back and even more! He's a star and if O2 don't give him a raise then there's no justice.CarlPs I suggest that o2 find a way during this Corona virus pandemic to allow people to use the one phone that they have. It's no ones fault to be isolated. Thank God you have Shaheem,2
"Just upgrade my phone at the store in Tunbridge Wells. The customer service was excellent, everything was explained really well and the whole process was super simple.",2
I want to post this review about Adam in the o2 shop in Cramlington. He kindly set up my new 12 pro and was extremely Helpful and  pleasant. I bought the phone online from o2 so he didn’t get any benefit..He is a credit to o2.,2
"I had already purchased my 24 month contract and switched over when I saw the reviews - and I was quite scared of what would happen. I had a horrendous experience with Three - no 4G ever, impossible to hear anyone over the phone, etc etc (I won't bore you). But since I made the switch, my life has been made so much easier because of O2. I have signal EVERYWHERE (I used to have just one bar when I was at home, with wifi), and have great network service so far.Also, Asad who sorted out my contract in store in Stratford was a gem. Honestly, the best customer service I've ever had in my life. That guy sets the standard - gold star service, and he's a super guy. I was dealing with Three over the phone while I was switching over, and he handled everything seamlessly. Made my life so easy. Give that guy a raise. I'll be recommending him and O2 to everyone.",2
"I recently purchased a Mobile WiFi system from O2 shop in Burnley Lancs. Had great service from two lovely, professional, patient young ladies Zaibaa and Jodie.Brilliant experience!!",2
I was scammed almost out of 1000 pounds luckily the man I spoke to helped me sort it out quickly and efficiently. Great service in my opinion.,2
"I have to say the team at O2 in Loughborough is simply brilliant.  Thank you Sayfur, Ian, Chirag, Kay and Sam.  If you want to know about customer service talk to this team.  They helped me upgrade my phone and helped every step of the way to ensure everything was transferred. We hit a few issues but they worked out how to do it, nothing was too much. Thank you for the time, effort and customer service to make me smile and recommend O2 to my friends.",2
"Today my sister and I went into our local Wrexham store. These shops can sometimes feel a little intimidating, especially if you are a technophobe.We had a lovely salesman to serve us though and he was very patient and understanding. He took him time to set up everything and explained everything that we needed to know. He was absolutely brilliant. Many thanks Anthony at Wrexham 02 store.Perhaps Anthony could give some sales tips to his colleague however who we could hear being a little passive aggressive in his sales approach.",2
Stephen van Rooyen my South African hero !!!Stephen helped me with my query and resolved the issue with speed and confidence.Spoke to me the whole time and was very professional.A credit to o2Thank you so much.,2
"I cancelled voicemail with O2  many months ago , now it is back on my phone . Unable to contact customer service at o2 , as at least 30 minute wait , also no chat on line .

Stephen Rooyen provided me with an outstanding excellent service,2
"I had a wonderful experience on Wednesday 16th of June 2021 during a phone call to O2 Customer Service.The call was with Pamela and I made the call at 09:11 am regarding a mobile for one of my O2 contracts (I have three).Pamela was absolutely wonderful. She was very knowledgeable, assertive, truly helpful and kind. She was patient and creative in finding ways to help me with my problem. I was quite anxious and her calm manner helped put me at ease and she managed to resolve my problem. I'm so grateful.Thank you very much to Pamela, absolute star!",2
"I called Customer Services after coming up against some difficulties applying a discount I’d been promised, online. I spoke to Stephen Van Rooyen, based in Cape Town, and wow, what a service. He spent time figuring out how to resolve the issue, was considerate, attentive and kept me informed throughout. He even called me back two days later with an update. He showed integrity, he was really friendly and we chatted for more than he is probably allowed but he was so bloody lovely, I didn’t want to let him go! Thanks for an incredible service and for resolving my issue, it’s much appreciated.",2
Really enjoyed our trip up the O2 this afternoon. One off the bucket list. Thank you Jacob.,2
"Amazing customer service. They changed my number immediately and explained to me, to understand, my issue with the contract. Thank you very much 5 🌟",2
"I recently had a fraud order made on my O2 account, where fraudsters had tried to order new iPhone. As soon as I realised I got straight in touch with O2’s customer support who where really helpful in resolving the issue for me, so that I wouldn’t be liable for the cost of the phone or the contract. I can’t rate their customer support service highly enough!",2
"Well I’ve just been to the 02 phone shop in Northwick, I can honestly say the staff and service was fantastic. I would definitely go there again. A big thank you for all your help.Melvin",2
"Went in today to query a few things, left with a new phone and a cheaper contract as it turned out that due to the phone I wanted, there was a way for me to trade in my old one, pay off my term early and have a large upfront payment, was very happy. Every time I have gone into the high wycombe store the staff have always been accommodating and helpful, so much so my partners even switching to O2 as he's so impressed by how I'm treated, even after being with them for so long.",2

"I would like to send a BIG Thank you to James the manager and James the assistant manager at the O2 store in Middleton Manchester. They relentlessly tried to solve the problem of my phone, which was lost in transit from the repair centre for an hour and a half. I am extremely grateful for their support and commitment in solving this problem. O2 are lucky to have such supportive staff. Thank you to you both 😊",2
Brilliant help from Stephen. He was able to explain causes of my phone problems and was a fountain of information. He was very pleasant and made sure I was happy with the help and info he gave me.  Highly recommended.,2
Stephen my advisor was most helpful in dealing with an ongoing query over the past 3-4 weeks which sadly hadn’t been resolved & completed by other members of staff to my frustration. He was well spoken & polite throughout our conversation & kept me informed of the process throughout.,2
"Sean and the team here in O2 Macclesfield have been outstanding. The device I wanted wasn’t available in store however went the extra mile to have it couriered the following morning.They found the right package for my excessive use. Store was impeccable in standards,PPE was worn by the whole team whom looked immaculate. Have been a customer of O2 for over 30 years in this day & age it’s challenging to find excellent customer care especially as the e-commerce is a popular destination for the masses.Thanks guys see you shortly",2
"WOW I can't believe  the bad experience some have had! It's usually the the usual suspects, haven't got a good word for anybody anything! Find fault......02 are or have been  with me BEAUTIFUL,  I've been with Vodafone, ee,  they  need to keep on taking them.All others pigy back there networks.02 so sweet!!!@@ play nice.",2
Brilliant customer service. I’ve been with o2 as my phone provider for around 15 years and they’ve always been great.I placed an order through today for an upgrade and spoke to two advisors who were both amazing and very friendly.I had an issue with the first order and called back and was helped by Lee who was superb. He went the extra mile to guide me through the process and to rectify the problem.Both calls were answered almost immediately after getting through the options and my queries were answered quickly by very friendly advisors.,2
Best customer service ever. Arun was very helpful very patient with all my questions.,2
Today I've called O2 and I'm so pleased and amazed how quick and easy the help was aragend for me.Unfortunately I forgot lady name..Ruben I think It was or Robyn.I would like to thank you for sending me the information so quickly.,2
"I received a call from Harry M, said he was a week new at the company and clearly knew his stuff. I upgraded my phone and am very happy with the deal.",2
"I don't understand all the bad reviews on here.Moved back to o2 at the beginning of last year. Hassle free porting number and setting it all up. Since then, I have a great signal and 4g.Last month I visited a store to purchase a smart watch. Again, hassle free and the service I recieved was amazing.",2
"Went into Macclesfield Store today to see about upgrading iPhone. Great advice from Tom with different options, prices and advice looking forward to the future. No pressure selling, very comfortable and as always will go back into that store as have used them for at least the last 10 years. Staff have always been very helpful in there.",2
"Timely professional help. I had the sad task of closing my Dad’s mobile phone account, with O2 (loss of capacity due to severe head injury). The chain of live phone communication and 2-3 straight forward emails, between us, with their want and willingness to help (from one human being to another) made it a caring and effortless experience. Thank you so much.",2
"Recently upgraded my Samsung phone with o2 at the Hedge End Southampton Shop in Next store. Terrific assistance from both the staff members in helping with my choice, this followed by excellent service in setting up my new phone and transferring all data from my old phone.I have been an o2 customer for more years than I can remember, only ever had a couple of queries, which were dealt with efficiently.Well done.",2
"Been with O2 for a few years and the team in store have always been friendly and helpful for all issues I have been in for. Sometimes getting the team members getting in touch with customer services can result in a wait, but having that face to face reassurance and pointers on how to get additional use out of my devices has been great for me",2
Jack Magee absolutely brilliant after being messed around for half an hour and kicked from the previous call this man is brilliant thank you jack all the best,2
I am O2 customer for many years but few times I was tempted to check other providers and will definitely stay with O2 only. If anyone complains about O2 services or customer advisors I strongly recommend to check others to see how bad it can be as you clearly have no idea.I actually don’t have to contact customer service often because everything is working with no problem. If there is anything I’m not happy about it is always resolved quickly and professionally (even during COVID). My upgrades are also always smooth process with great offers. Customer advisors every time are helpful and professional so I can’t remember I had to call twice for the same thing. If any follow up was needed they were contacting me.Not a cheapest network - fact - but at least you know what you are paying for. Years of hassle free use are worth it.,2
"Had a great experience chatting with Jane Howard (I hope that's her name) and setting up my phone upgrade last week.  I really felt like she had the time to talk me through the process and also make a personal connection.  Being in the wellbeing industry I am all about connections, which is the most important of the five ways to wellbeing (as defined by New Economics Foundation).  Thanks for taking the time for asking a bit about me and making me laugh.",2
BEST COVERAGE ABOUT!!! EVEN WITH GIFFGAFF,2
"I recently spoke to an O2 advisor (David) earlier this afternoon. However, I would like to write a positive review (to be passed to O2 management/customer service), as I felt highly satisfied with the phone call - as though I was talking to a friend/relative. This is because David made me feel comfortable, happy, relaxed whilst talking to him throughout the phone call. Besides talking about any queries I had with my contract & being able to resolve them quickly & effectively, I also had a personal conversation with David about “everyday chitchat”. If I had to sum up David; he’s warm, polite, friendly, courteous, helpful, charismatic, assertive, supportive & (if given the chance), would definitely love to talk to David again, in the future. Also, for any customers who have possibly taken out a contract/had problems with a different phone company - I would highly recommend O2 (I will be staying with O2 when my contract expires).",2
Absolutely fantastic company. No problems at all.,2
"Spoke to a very helpful colleague today named @John. I had trouble trying to take out a new contract for over one week and this guy helped me and was extremely patient. He explained everything and answered all my questions! He was on the phone with me for 1hr 30mins and not once rushed the call, instead he sorted out the issue and helped me take out a new contract. He was such a lovely gentleman and genuinely did everything he could to help me! I’ve spoken to many colleagues from o2 over 3 years of being with them and not once have I ever experienced bad customer service. I can’t thank John enough and the o2 team; every time I have rang for anything they have been extremely helpful! The network has been amazing and I cannot recommend them enough! Excellent service 👍🏼 Well done and thank you again 🙌🏼",2
"From roqueHer name is Amy from o2 customer service went extra mile to solve my issue as i  wanted a help to keep my old number , i tried on o2 app , it was asking me for 2 character which i had no idea about it so she sorted my issues about the problem without any hesitation.Keep it up. Excellent.",2
"Really surprised by the low rating here. I just used their online chat to resolve a problem with text messages. My bank was trying to send me a temporary password that I was not receiving.  I open the chat on their site, and they solved my problem in less than 10 minutes.  Never really interact with O2 otherwise but on this first interaction they were brilliant!",2
O2 your the best .Lovely customer service although expensive I still value you .Thank you for looking after me and being understanding I’ll be with you forever .Always the best service and a lovely customer service thanks again .I’m truly loyal ….Thank youZara,2
Ordered an Apple Watch from O2 the order was placed and arrived the next dayEasy to use website and easy to find what I needed including tariffWell done O2,2
OMG thank you soooo much o2. Sending me an alert on a text message while I’m on the phone to whom I thought was 02 ( fraudster) just about to tell them the code. This is the best thing any company has done. I feel like you literally pulled me out the wrong door. I’m so grateful THANKYOUStrongly defiantly recommend o2,2
"I was in a real fix communication-wise and ill and a friend sent me an O2 sim card via you-know-who. The instructions were straightforward and my phone adjusted after restarting. I didn't need to reload Whatsapp etc. I am really grateful for the easy transition. Yesterday, I noticed the same sim card in my local supermarket, so next time I'm in a fix, I'll know what to do for £10.",2
I spoke to Kim at 02 today and she was very polite and helpful! Definitely the best service I’ve got so far from o2!,2
I phoned 202 and nicola answered.( I think thats her name) She has amazing customer service. I'm not lying. I asked 50 questions and she was patient the whole way. She needs a promotion definitely. Changing sim was extremely simple gave me a great deal and don't have to do anything extra no ordering a new sim.,2
"I been an O2 customers for 4 years. I am honestly surprised about the bad customer service reviews. Whenever I had to phone them I was always able to solve my issue in less than 5 minutes, friendly, professional and straightforward customer service. My coverage was always great in London. The only reason why I am leaving  after 4 years because I found a better deal. Other than that I highly recommend it.",2
"I just spoke to someone called Kyle. He was informative, clear, knowledgable and to be honest, seemed like a proper top bloke. I’ve been with O2 for years so I know what to expect and how the process works when I upgrade my phone. After having concerns with completing the form on the app, Kyle took me through it step by step. It didn’t feel patronising or ‘salesy’, it was a really comfortable and pleasant experience. I felt completely at ease with the whole process and this is because of Kyle. I have never written a good review for someone before as I haven’t ever received such a good service that I felt I needed to commend someone. A true credit to O2, if someone can please ensure his line manager is informed that would be greatly appreciated.Also, I’ve been with O2 for years and have found them to be helpful if there is an issue. My most recent phone had a problem with it and they arranged a replacement without any hassle. I’ve also entered into their competitions on O2 priority and won many prizes - although I enter daily!Thank you, Madison",2
Just came over to O2 from BT. Porting my number went great. Free Disney Plus for six months too. So far so good.,2
"Early days but can’t be happier!Got sim only plan just 12GB for tenner so really cheap.Have Pixel 5 and getting over 200Mbps in my location (Liverpool). Since I’m working from home so pretty much on WiFi all the time 12GB is plenty!Switched from Three, they put two 5G mast in the city and claimed coverage. O2 has like 50% covered!Love it.",2
"Mohammad was extremely helpful, very nice and understanding of my situation and was very clear throughout, very pleased with my service today",2
I’m a new customer to o2 I joined on 18th January on a sim only from Vodafone my number was ported to o2 on the 19th without a problem. Ive done some speed tests and its way better than Vodafone I’m getting 175:20 Mb/s download and 8.60 Mb/s upload in my area NG19 which is a 5g area. Not tried calling customer service so can’t comment on that.,2
The best network 02 for best coverage with strong signal and customer services  are excellent  sorting out my problems. 02 have more masts than any other networks in UK. I joined 02 on 12.01.2021from Three Network.,2
"Reliable company, been with them for many years.",2
"I have been with O2 for 4 years, always had great customer service and great upgrades plans 👌🏻",2
"Dave, has been absolutely helpful and understanding during this pandemic he’s great at doing his job even though Ive annoyed him  please recognise his carisma and his hard work!",2
"customer service resolved and very empathetic, was a poor review but they turned it around",2
I went into the Macclesfield 02 shop yesterday to buy a new iPhone. I was served by Tom who was extremely helpful and proactive.,2
l lost my phone over Christmas which is unusual for me so quite worried as my mother is in a care home. went into the O2 shop in Macclesfield should have had ID which l hadn't on me but when l explained my concerns l was looked after and taken through all security checks. Thanks Tom for all your help you were so helpful and had me sorted with a new phone in no time. Excellent first class service.,2
"Hi thanks for the most amazing service I have ever received, Ben was super helpful and went out of his way to help me, I was in a dilemma where I was paying too much every month, he was so empathetic and honest and did his very best to see what he can do for me! He managed to get me a cheaper deal and I am now a customer for life! Can’t thank him enough! He deserves a pay rise !! Deserves a bonus!Ben taylor concentrixs team.Needs a promotion!",2
One of the best networks in UK. Good enough to go,2
I can only give 5 stars to a certain customer support agent Jack Edwards from the Dearne Valley call centre in Rotherham. He was absolutely brilliant and sorted out our problem. We cannot thank him enough. Previously we made numerous phone calls all ending in either being cut off or saying they could not help giving 1 star service. We then went to a shop and they could not help either. So a massive thank you to Jack Edwards in the Dearne Valley call centre for giving us a little faith in 02. Very much appreciated.,2
"Just a quick review to say thank you to Tracy T (complaints) who resolved my issue in a single afternoon.Always refreshing for such a speedy resolution and got me back a hefty £224 that had been taken in error.Thanks again,Emily",2
"I spoke to Gerry today who was really lovely, chatty, and thorough. Was planning on leaving O2 but was convinced to stay as he was really helpful in finding a plan that suited me. Related to me as a customer, and ensured i had all of the information I needed to feel comfortable moving forward. Thanks Gerry!",2
O2 suggested that i should purchase an ipad for my studies and i can honestly say this has been the best purchased i've ever made. its like they knew what i needed and what was the perfect fit for me. thank you O2!!,2
"Amazing and understanding customer service, rang as struggling financially. So sympathetic and willing to help. Plus 02Have fantastic referral service for customer who have difficulties in interacting in making calls etc. I simply can not fault how brilliant the service was. Thank you 02",2
"I can't believe how many negative reviews there are about this company - have they been dealing with the same provider that I have?I've been an o2 customer since I was about 13 years old (I'm now 25), and I've never had any problems with them.I've been due an upgrade since March 2020, but I couldn't be bothered to visit my local branch, so just decided to upgrade on the My o2 app. I'd never done this before, but it was actually SO simple. I ordered my new phone at 9PM yesterday and unbelievably it arrived within 12 hours - how good is that?Also, just wanted to say that the 'My o2' app is really useful and easy to use!",2
"I recently switched from Vodafone. It wasn't bad, but they couldn't deliver a basic decent 4G speed for 3 years. Also, never listened to the feedback. Launching a 5G network with big hoo-ha without stabilising the local 4G networks is a bad business strategy.So, I switched to O2. My personal experience is good so far. I have now decent speed, and the customer service knows what they are doing. I made them thinking hard, trust me. :))) I like the O2 app as well, it's clear and simple and straight forward and not like Vodafone, O2 don't try to push down all the irrelevant offers in my throat. I can manage better my account as well, it's just working well as expected. They have decent automated messaging service in place, so whenever I made some changes compared to the other providers I got more reassurance at O2 about what is going on, then the others (Vodafone and EE).",2
After dreadful customer service from Carphone Warehouse I chose to trade in my phone at 02 at the Gyle store in Edinburgh. First class customer service and took around 10minutes max to sort. Difference between the 2 is night and day.,2
"I have tried and moved to many other mobile network providers over the years. I now always buy my own mobile phone and get a 12 month sim only deal 40GB data, unlimited minutes & unlimited texts for £8 per month. I always setup a spend cap, premium rate bars and limits on my account to stop any nasty surprises on my monthly bill. It would be fantastic if bars could be turned on or off in the My O2 app please. Thank you.",2
"Hi, today i just had a remarkable experience on the phone with one of the employees of your Payment Management department, his name is Colin. He was very professional, patient, kind and he explains with knowledge and a very nice voice to listen to all the details about my case. I was very impressed and I would like to congratulate him and your company on his outstanding customer service special in these days.",2
Best phone company on the market by far 👌👌👌👌👌,2
"Needed to order a new micro sim, 02 sorted it out straight away and I was back up a running in no time! Thanks Amanda Lawrence for all your help",2
"The O2 store at Morfa, Swansea went the whole 9 yards to ensure that a new mobile phone was set up perfectly. It was not an easy set and took place over a few days, some issues arose that needed a coordinated effort within O2.Could not be happier with the level of customer service and effort.",2
Sanna is a star! The most helpful customer service consultant. I had an issue to activate my business account and manage to fix it. Also explained to me why my data usage was so high although I haven't used it.I'm very happy of how helpful sanna was to me.Thanks sanna🤞,2
I just wanted to leave a fantastic review for an absolute star who has been helping me. Christopher edge. He has helped every step of the way with my upgrade/switching from another network. Thank you Chris!,2
"I've been an O2 customer with multiple contracts for over 10 years and I've never had any problems with them.Service is almost perfect and when it comes to renewing and upgrading, I always find they'll provide the very best offers available.I really couldn't find fault in the service I've received.",2
Was in the Glasgow Fort O2 shop and was served by John who did an excellent job of switching all my data on my old phone over to the new handset.   I had a bad experience of O2 in Braehead where the guy who was serving me basically told me to go home and google this and watch a U tube video.   Needless to say I left the shop without changing my contract.   I cannot praise John at the Glasgow Fort enough.,2
WowTook advantage of Black Friday 2020 deal.  Not only saved 17% on phone but delivery was amazing with no charge!!!Ordered 7:30pm Sunday arrived 9:30 am Monday,2
"Great service, Great company.Enough said",2
"Rang O2 today to get some help with switching my tariff for a payg sim as I am in need of waaaay more data and I was running out. Although my request was a bit difficult as I have already changed it once this week, they still found a way to do it at no extra cost. I would like to say thanks to Jaamine and her manager for being absolute superstars! Thanks again!",2
"Very good coverage. Very good customer service, exceptional price.",2
I saw Ryan on the 4th November to change my sons tariff in Stirling Scotland branch.Ryan was helpful and patient and had a friendly and supportive manner.I will definitely be returning to that branch when I’m due and upgrade. Thank you!,2
If you want great customer service I highly recommend Jacob he has been really helpful with our transactions. A really lovely guy to speak through everything with and went above and beyond.,2
"This review is for Paul at the Coventry 02 store.In brief after my Dad purchased a new phone, he had numerous issues with it and was getting charged daily for services he wasn’t using. After several frustrating calls to customer service and lots of different advise that got us nowhere and practically made the phone unusable.We went back to the store, Paul sorted the phone out, suggested a better tariff for Dads needs and reset everything for him.Dad was so grateful for his professionalism and time, asked me to put a review on in the hope he receives the recognition deserved.",2
"I honestly don’t see all the hate for 02. Never had a problem with them. Straight to the point when setting up the contracts without them sneaky little add ones. Just people need to aswell ask, reads, double and triple check before signing them. Good service and got good deals from them",2
"I am so shocked with O2's rating here.  It doesn't make sense!  I've been with them since they were BT, before it became BT Cellnet, before Cellnet and then O2.Over the many years with this company I have seen it develop a lot but the things that always keeps me with them are their customer service, their fairness and their reliability.So, how the hekk in hell are O2 only getting an average rating of less than 2*s?  I can only envisage two reasons for this.  The 1st is that many of the reviews are not from O2's customers.  I just can't believe so many genuine customers would think so lowly of them.  The other reason is that those rating O2 so lowly have never experienced the customer service of the other network providers.  EE already had terrible service and now they are now owned by BT I can just imagine how much further they will go to prove they are the worst.All people I know, except one, is on O2 and all have exactly the same experience as me.  If they have a problem, they call O2 and the call is ansered within seconds, not days like other companies.  Additionally, when you get to speak to somebody at O2, that person takes ""responsibility"" for your query, issue, complaint etc. and that person stays with you until all is resolved.  With other networks, it can take days of trying to get through as even when a call is answered it's only so they can put you on hold for as long as it takes before you lose patience and hang up.  When you do finally get through to sopmebody they either put you on hold until you go away or they pass you through to somebody else, who passes you to somebody else etc. etc. until you give up going around in circles with nobody taking responsibility for your query.So, with my decades of experience with O2, I really wish I could score them 5,000* so I can wipe out the fake and the unfair revues and leave enough to outweigh future fake and unfair reviews for quite some time.Sadly, I can't score more than the 5* so that is what I have given.  I highly recommend O2 and have done so for many years and not a single person that I have encouraged to switch to O2 has had any regret.",2
"The service that I have received from 02 in Kensington High Street has always been very good and professional. But yesterday I collected my new I-phone 12 Pro from Mr Rohan Ramaiya at 10AM and he simply couldnt have been more helpful, patient and incredibly efficient. He went out of his way to ensure that I got the tarrif and all the various accessories that I needed without pushing me into buying unecessary items. He was absolutely first class in every respect.This is a store that I can really recommend for all one's mobile phone needs. Thank you all for being such a great team.",2
"I ordered an iPhone 12 from O2 which I have just received.  A faultless 5-star experience.  The experience was similar when I ordered my wife's phone a few weeks ago.By comparison, I first started this journey by unsuccessfully trying to order from Three - I have left a review (via TP) regarding this experience which I begrudgingly gave a 1-star.Well done O2",2
"I would like to thank Rachel after my visit this morning. With patience, understanding and good humour, she assessed the various problems , untangled the chaos and handed me back a perfectly working phone.What an asset she is to the store, And I love the colour of her hair!!!!!!!",2
Great service all through lockdown.  Thankyou.  Also great competitions on O2 priority and thankyou for the free coffees much appreciated.,2
Been with O2 since 2010. Never had a problem. Good value and I like the way my phone agreement is separate from my airtime,2
02 are absolutely brilliant best network to be on upgraded my wife from sim plan to device plan when the device arrived it was damaged I rang o2 no problem they arranged for new device to be delivered next day to swap for damaged one excellent service 10 /10,2
"Many thanks to Rachel at the Bury O2 shop who helped me swop my SIM last Thursday.  A simple task for most people but for a ""senior citizen"" somewhat daunting.  She also took steps to enable me to keep my number.  Thanks again, Rachel!",2
"I have been very pleased with my service from the 02 shop in  Worthing, Tooting and Wandsworth.   BUT a cowboy in the 02 shop in Clapham Junction lost me 80 contacts and only managed to transfer 6.!!",2
"I've been with O2 for almost 9 years as a ""pay as you go"" customer and I'm really happy with their service. Their prices have always been very competitive, they have some fantastic offers (they only send me a text about them once in a while, no hassle at all), they also have a great rewards program, and their signal is very strong too (when I'm in some remote place, I often have better connection than my friends who have different mobile providers). I can totally recommend them.",2
Brilliant service all data rolls over verry nice customer service yeah just good service tbh.,2
"Mr Layke of Manchester and Ms Lisa Ray of South Africa office overseas thank you both for being very helpful and informative.O2 has a very good reception.Moreover; the Customer services are Polite, Professional, and Posh.I have been with O2 almost for 8 years by now, and also moved my existing number to O2 recently.",2
Fantastic customer service from Lindsay dealing with a fairly complex Phone issue. Very professional and restored our faith in O2.,2
"I have been wanting to upgrade my phone for a while. Customer services were calling while I was at work. I have finally managed to call in and get sorted. I spoke with a lovely lady, Holly (in Sheffield) who was super helpful, bubbly and definitely deserves recognition for her wonderful service today! Thanks Holly!",2
Just want to say a massive thank you to Anna on the upgrades team. She’s been an absolute star! After being with o2 for so many years and being passed around whole day trying to sort out my upgrade. She’s gone above and beyond for me and she truly deserves to be recognised for this. So thank you so much Anna!!,2
Online chat 30/08/2020Excellent service. Didnt have to queue and listen to music. Just type my question and away it went.   I messed up the password so Nikhil sent a code instead. I wanted to change my payment date which was done efficiently and within a few mins. Nikhil was polite and charming. This isnt the 1st time ive been on online chat. I do recommend it.,2
"I recently bought a sim card for a dongle for use on a laptop by a friend who was in hospital. I had problems trying to monitor the usage (so I could top it up) so called o2 Customer Services for advice. The first advisor I spoke to was not all synpathetic or helpful as no matter how many times I told him that the person using the card did not have a mobile phone, he continued to tell me to advise him to register with o2 so they could send him a a text with a code...so in total frustration I decided to call again and was connected to a different adviser called Charlotte. I made it clear that I was very close to tears and might either scream or cry.... she remained calm and listened to what I was telling her very carefully - and straight away was able to get to the bottom of the problem. She advised me that I had purchased the wrong kind of sim needed for use on a laptop and advised me that after a while it would stop working. Rather than making me feel stupid she simply asked for the adress where she could send a replacement sim which I gave her. The very next day the sim card arrived at my friends parents house and they were able to take it to the hospital for him to use. Not only that but she preloaded the card with credit to replace the credit that I had put on th eoriginal sim card....  this was a just a really fantastic happy end to a frustrating situation in which everyone involved was already under a lot of stress. Charlotte seemed to understand not just thge technical issue that needed reolving - but also had great empathy regarding the dilemma I was in. My faith in customer services was renewed - if only everyone could be trained by Charlotte! She made my day - I just wish I could send her some chocolates or flowers .",2
"Amazing service at the Eastleigh Swan Centre store. I was helped by a lovely lady yesterday who was helpful, polite and a pleasure to talk to really. I had walked in to talk about iPhone upgrades and walked out with a new iPad! Just goes to show how good she is at her job really, though I never felt pressured to buy and believe I walked out with a really great deal. Credit where credit is due and this woman deserves praise. If only I could deal with her every time I went to O2!",2
I recently had a phone call with one of the O2 representatives because I was paying a £40 monthly bill and my contract was coming to an end. I wanted to switch to a pay monthly contract and the lady on the phone was lovely and so helpful and got me on a £10 a month contract with everything I needed (and I got disney+ for free via O2!!) Thank you for making switching super easy!,2
"I am having financial issues due to COVID, unable to pay my costly bill. Julie from Payment management was able to rearrange everything for me and even helped me sort things out. I really appreciate her, she is an asset to O2.",2
Sat in store at the moment making an insurance claims staff have been extremely helpfull,2
O2 the best network in UK I’m customer with them over 9 years I never have any problem .,2
Been with o2 for years and see no reason for leaving. Reasonably priced for a great service.,2
"Been with for many years, no problem to report, guess I must be one of the lucky ones!",2
"called customer services as was having issues with a code i was sent for my upgrade. Spoke to a lovely lady called Eleanor who dealt with my issue and helped to find me the best quote! Left the call happy with the service she has provided and with a new upgrade on the way!I have spoken to some vile customer service people, I just wish a lot more of them had the patience and people skills as Eleanor and that way O2 would have a lot more happy customers!Thanks again and fingers crossed for Spain x",2
"So far not had a problem with O2, network coverage for me is excellent and at a decent price.I have had some poor network providers before (namely Virgin mobile and most recently EE) and so far O2 has been head and shoulders above them.Hopefully this will continue.",2
"I’ve been with Three for years, but sadly since the world Crisis Three has been shocking, switching and using O2 has been fab ( so far ) and the bonus of AppleTV+ and Disney+ was cool also!I’m hoping that the so far excellent service continues...",2
"Signed up for o2 over the weekend, received an email saying I needed to call in to confirm my order. Called and Instantly got put through to an advisor who was very friendly and helpful. Early days yet but I'm impressed by the level of service so far",2
Matthew from Burnley was really helpful on the phone. After being rejected twice and I re-applied and I was accepted for the Samsung Tablet TAB A 10.1. He explained things perfectly and went out of his way to assist me further. Absolutely polite on the phone and excellent customer services skills :),2
Always been happy as a customer with 02. They seem to give me a really good deal. Customer service team is pleasant. Thank you :-),2
I went to the 02 shop in Redcar ( teesside) Tommy was very polite and dealt with my enquiry without any chew. I left there very pleased nothing was a problem.,2
I would like to thank the staff at the Truro store (especially Luke) for all the help given to me yesterday in a difficult environment.Peter Jennings,2
"Just had a really positive experience with John from O2 technical support.  He was personable, supportive and went out of his way to help me. Gave me really good advice and resolved a sim issue.",2
Fabulous company and service provided.  Highly recommend.,2
"I am taking five minutes out of my day to thank O2 representative James Lohan for the courtesy and helpfulness he extended to me recently.Faced with a situation that I was unsure how to proceed with, James Lohan helped me through the process with a perfectly pleasant and professional manner.What I thought was going to be a somewhat difficult experience was made so much easier by this young man. No question was too absurd and never once was I left feeling overwhelmed with jargon I didn't understand.He has restored my faith in customer services and ensured that 02 has secured my business for the foreseeable future.Thank you againJames Lohan O2 Customer Services.19/05/20 13:18CASE ID :1199273032",2
I am an O2 customer for over 4 years i can say that i am happy with their service. I never had any reception problem like i had with Three. Just renewed my contract i toked  the samsung a90 5g for 30 months with 30 GB  and insurance for £53 a month,2
"My mum ordered a contract phone, was to be delivered today, she didn't realise she had signed up for a ""cashback"" phone, this meant the contract had risen from £23 to £37 per month, my mum wasn't understanding of this, and even though the fault was hers, we called 02 and spoke to AJ, he sorted the whole mess out for her and she now has a new phone at the price she wanted, big up to 02, massive up to AJ, and one happy oap 😊",2
"I've never had a problem with o2. I've been with them since I was 15 and I'm now 32. I moved to may monthly after being on pay as you go since I joined them. I get unlimited calls, texts and 100GD of data for £20 p/m. I've never had issues with my connection, signal quality or with the staff. Generally, I refuse to go with anyone else as I've been with Vodafone and Virgin before and they are terrible.",2
"Ordered a new sim only deal - came the next working day.Filled in online form with PAC code details - number ported within 24hrs.All up and running. As yet, no problems.",2
I always end up back with 02.  From the shops to customer service and ease of use much better than Tesco mobile anyway.,2
I told O2 I may have had Covid_19 but I was looking after my family and out of work due to the Coronavirus. They offered to put a hold on my account and leave my phone on so I could keep in touch with my family. I thought that was an amazing thing for them to do in already difficult times. I have been with O2 for a very long time (since bt cellnet) and don't see that changing any time soon. Thank you O2. I did end up paying but the offer was still good.,2
During a time like this in COVID-19 I wasn't expecting to be served at all or anyone to answer. After getting through the automated service I was put through to Adam who's service was perfect! I wanted an upgrade and wasn't sure on the best deal but Adam talked me through them all and made it clear to what I would be paying for and for how long as well as going through what works for me data wise and airtime. I've been with O2 for over 5 years and always gone through Carphone Warehouse and never really had thorough service like that so was very impressed with O2. I am now looking forward to my contract and upgrade as I'm fully aware of what I'm paying for as Adam dealt with everything and explained it to a T.,2
"I had a problem with my o2 pay as you go an am living abroad in oz. I normally have a contract in uk. I tried a few times to get through but due to covid had no luck so sent in an email to complaints an an o2 emplyee called Rachel was extremely helpful and answered my email, requested more info and then sorted my sim problem out. I am delighted with the customer service i received from o2 today. I have been with o2 for years and will continue.",2
"The longest I've spent with any network. They've been more than happy to renew me onto contracts priced even better than new customer deals when I've phoned up each year, and O2 Priority actually has some great benefits (that I didn't think I'd make any use of originally).",2
O2 /telefonica ukAfter upgrading my phone and taking out one of the o2 promotional deals with o2 buisness i never recived my Samsung watches (the promotion was free watches)after nearly 100days (was suppost to be delivered in 45days) i contacted samsung and the courier (fedex) myself without any luck.So i contacted the head office of o2/telefonica uk after just 3 days (including a weekend) problem solved could not have asked for a better response time or resolution.I am supprised to see so many bad reviews after the perfect and quick response i got.ThankyouMore than appreciated as this was a serious head ache for me,2
Love o2 all issues are solved and data is fast and great signal sometimes low in village area but overall really satisfied with the service way better than Vodafone or EE always quick and easy to resolve problems,2
"I am not a person who likes to leave reviews but today I have too.I was trying to upgrade my phone online but the website wasn’t allowing me to finish my order, so I decided to call o2, although the o2 msg said I would wait longer than usual, I was answered quite quickly, I got a very helpfull advicer I hope I got her name right Shuana, she was very patient, kind, and very sympathetic person, all I wanted was to finish my upgrade over the phone I wasn’t expected I could get any discount, but she volunteered to find something better for me, so she manage take £260 from my mobile phone device, I am so happy with my deal.I really can’t thank her enough, thank you Shuana.",2
Complaint about my bill dealt with within less than 24 hours. Really couldn't get better than that especially in time of COVID crisis.Absolutely fabulous,2
Great network. Always have coverage and had no problems at all whilst being with them.,2
I am a new customer2 weeks ago I got a new phone with o2 due to not having a credit history I had to pay a deposit of £425.00 which I did. One week later the county got turned on its head Covid 19 hit due to the issues with work and money I rang and asked if the £425 could be refunded without the loss of my service I seen that 02 supported my request and refunded this to my account outstanding service and support plus understanding thank you 02.,2
"I’m on pay as you go, received a text today giving me 300 free minutes to stay in touch with others during this tough time, I love this. It’s lovely to think they’re helping people who may be less fortunate and can’t talk to friends/family members through what’s going on. No other phone company I know of has done this",2
"I have had an O2 contract for two years,not once have I had a insufficient service.Good signal coverage, good response from customer service and the app works well to.My only gripe is hard sale that I got when I asked for a pac code.My contract was expiring and I found a better deal for the phone and package I required.That was the only reason for switching operators.",2
"Had a problem with handset purchased through third party. Wasn't O2's responsibility to resolve bit after the retailer refused to help they replaced the handset FOC and arranged delivery within 48 hours. Amazing service. Aisha was so understanding, only been with O2 for 3 months and felt like a valued customer.Please let Aisha know how pleased we were. Call was around 5:30 on Wednesday 24th March.",2
"Amazing service all round, thank you",2
Really good pay as you go service and really friendly,2
"Went to the O2 Huntingdon store and James the store leader helped us and I could not fault one thing! He was amazing!!!! After and awful experience with Carphone Warehouse, James made us feel at ease and helped us with every step he could. He is a true credit to O2 and when my phone contract expires I will be switching to O2!Amazing service!!",2
"I spoke to three agents today about cancelling my contract: Siliziwu, Nathan and Tracy. Siliziwu was pleasant to speak to and handled my query quickly and efficiently. Nathan was a star and really helped me know all options I had available during a really stressful and sticky situation and I really appreciated that help from him ; I wish our call wasn't disconnected. Tracy was so friendly and reassured me that everything was being actions etc. All three agents were brilliant and I'm so pleased with the service they provided.",2
"Never had one problem with there customer service, even when I've been really late paying my bill. Always very helpful",2
Fantastic data speeds and good package prices. Never had any calls drop out. Has UK call centres with staff that have a lot of knowledge about how to resolve problems. Comes with WiFi and 4G calling on sim only aswell.  No problems with O2.Worth the slightly higher price than Three as you can actually use the data you pay for.,2
"Good company, focus is the customer, reception is always good. Not cheap but fine, you get what you pay for.",2
"I have recently visited the O2 store in Southampton West Quay. As soon as I walked in it felt a good vibe and the staff all Friendly. I would like to give a shout out to Steve the advisor that helped me with a new contract and sim plan. He listened to everything I was saying and what I wanted from the plans and came up with a brilliant deal.In the past I had not had great experiences with the staff in the O2 stores even though I have been a customer for many years, however I would like to congratulate the Southampton store for restoring my faith in the company.Thank you again to Steve I will be recommending this store 😁",2
I was with O2 back than when they were called BT cellnet back in the day and EE was t mobile and one 2 one network .....But they offered me the best at the time ...now fast forward 20 years later and they are still here and improving as time goes by ...I think there customer service has been good to me so far plus they offered me the best Sim with alot of data for my money....Although at times they network does suffer from network loss but that's with all these networks nowadays depending on were Ur based....,2
I’ve spoke to a few 02 agents previously and liz was one of the most helpful along with another agent and they definitely exceeded in customer service. I thank them both for there help this morning.,2
"I wanted to personally thank Elorm in the O2 shop at 351 Oxford Street in London .Seamlessly assisted me in upgrading 2 Iphones  and the purchase of an apple watch.There was a discrepancy in the address on file which he painstakingly took charge of and rectified. Made the whole experience memorable and enjoyable . Also gave perfect advice and top quality customer service.A true professional in every sense.Carry on the great work Elorm .Kindest regards , Paul.",2
"I have smashed my phone, and after reading some reviews I was in doubts if they would help me, but no. I called and after 15 minutes talk everything was sorted and the very next day I have received the new phone trough DPD, and the smashed phone picked up. Phone insurance is not a waste of money after all.",2
I had an issue trying to upload a photo I had taken with my O2 iPhone (the file size was too large). I contacted the O2 helpline and Shadsha told me how to compress the file. Really good customer care. Many thanks.,2
"Been a customer for 15 years! I had my fair share of issues during that time as to be expected, but to be fair they always come through. Tried going off to the cheaper networks a few times but always came back promptly as none of the others are as well balanced. I get a largely hasslefree mobile life with O2 and that is all I want. I have found the best experience of O2 is to buy direct as whenever I got the 3rd party dealers involved, I always got cheated somehow - and I always but direct from one of their stores - the staff are usually great and the guru service if brilliant for any problems I have faced. Merry Christmas O2!",2
I was spoke with Daniel Davids 1995.very nice polite and funny Guy. explain me all i want 2 know.5☆,2
"Had a dispute over a bill which I did not think I should pay.  Having spoken to Lauren at 02 I was delighted that the matter was fully resolved to my satisfaction.  Well done Lauren and 02, excellent customer service",2
Fantastic customer service! All staff I spoke to had a good knowledge and were able to help me! They were patient when it came to making decisions! They listened to what I wanted rather than trying to sell me something of more value! Can’t fault them at all!,2
"My contract is finished so was going to leave and get a sim deal only because of price.received pac number and decided to  ring 02 to see if they could match a good deal I saw,which they did. Sheila In customer services was very helpful and explained how to change over from one phone to another,which I already bought,Phone up and running couldn’t ask for more.",2
"I realise there are not may good reviews on here because I guess most relate to handset/contract/broadband issues but as I only used the O2 shop I am only giving a review for that.  Ordered a bluetooth speaker, which was the cheapest price on the internet, it came with free delivery, it arrived by courier the next day.  Extremely good service in my opinion.  Shame all the other departments don't get the same views.  Well done O2 shop!!",2
"Absolutely brilliant company!! The my 02 app is so easy to check your upcoming bill and offers. Very clear on what you owe and next month bill . I have been with a lot of mobile companies and been so disappointed . 02 launched the very first iPhone in Britain, first touch screen!! I got one for my Christmas from my partner . He’s been with 02 ever since. They don’t bombard you with emails and texts. Definitely check 02 !!",2
"I appreciate many people come on here to complain about the service of O2 but I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the excellent customer service I received from Joseph Ncanyawa in helping me with my account earlier this month 9/11/19.It is the first time dealing with O2, that I have felt the need to write to knowledge a member of their customer service team and that is down to Joesph.If you are lucky to speak to him...I am sure like me you will appreciate it afterwardsWell done Joseph...keep up the good work!",2
"HEATHER from Maidenhead store was absolutely brilliant !Switched from Samsung to Huawei and she completely took the strain out of it.Helpful, cool and successful. A credit to 02.Thanks again,Paul",2
"I think O2 is brilliant! I have been on O2 for quite a few years now and I have never had any problems neither with the network, neither with billing. In fact, I had a big problem to solve with my new mobile bought from ""Affordable mobiles""(never again!!!) and O2 guys at Horwich Middlebrook centre did everything and more to solve my problem. All of them! Thank you so much to all those young men who has so much patience with us older people who do not understand new technology very well. Great team, great network!Vilija",2
"Excellent customer service, Peterborough Thanks Jamie",2
Purchased new 100GB SIM contract.SIM arrived on next day.They have transferred my number from giffgaff in no time.Brilliant service so far.,2
"Surprised that O2 have such a low rating on Trust Pilot. Many years ago, I used to us O2 all the time right up until I had my first contract with Vodafone (that's a company you need to avoid like the plague) and after rubbish signal, I moved to EE. Move to a new house and my signal with EE was shocking and was in an ongoing dispute with them for months. They eventually cancelled my contract and I took out my first O2 phone contract.Fantastic signal in the area that I live. Fantastic customer service who are always on hand to help, whether that be in store or online. Great deals.But what really ripped the scales for me is that earlier in the month, they had a promotion where they pay off contracts so you can upgrade to O2 refresh. I ended up with a brand new phone, still maintaining a fantastic service and signal and can change my phone whenever I want (within reason of course).Genuinely have no complaints and I hope that I continue to have all the more reason to keep using them.",2
"i would like to give a review about the staff of the 02shop, market st branch, manchester.They are the nicest most helpful staff iv’e ever dealt with in particular Lisa. She is one of the most efficient and helpful members of staff who gives 100% to the customer, she is a delight to deal with and takes time to explain to a technophobe such as myself, the easiest way round the latest smartphone and making it so much easier for me to understand all the technical jargon. She obviously knows what she’s talking about and is so patient n helpful she is an absolute asset to the 02 company.From a very satisfied customer Mrs B",2
As I work in customer service my self I only want the professionalism which I give my self. I spoke to an Adam Taylor in Payment Management based in Warrington. The quality and assurance    I was given from this agent was amazing. He went above and beyond to help me to his best ability. I hope his team leader and manger see this as he is a asset to the company. I wish that many other o2 agents are like Adam. Thanks Adam!!,2
"Have had problems with my pay and go. I contacted O2 and they have taken the matter seriously, contacted me several times by phone and messenger and have shown an interest in solving the problem.",2
Went in Chatham o2 store on 22/09/2019 to fix an issue with my mother's Pay and Go tariff. o2 representative Mya was very friendly and approachable. She has done all in her power to help us with our issue and even called to o2 customer service for us twice. She stood for our case until the end. We are very pleased with helpful service and highly recommend to visit this store.,2
"Was on the verge of moving my business account but had the most professional, courteous, friendly and efficient call with Martin Loughnave who was so helpful I decided to stay. Hope 02 can recognise him for his professionalism.",2
"Fraud took place on my account. Called O2 who first asked me to email the fraud company and speak to them directly. O2 asked to call them back if I had any issues. Two days later after speaking with this fraudulent company ""remote games"" I called O2 and spoke to Leonie. She was a brilliant help and was able to get these charges refunded by a good will gesture. Thanks O2 and Leonie for the quick resolution.",2
The customer service is truly the best... couldn't fault it quick and accurate service... such friendly people and always find a way to help.,2
"Always had a great experience with O2, always helpful on chat and happy to assist.",2
"I ordered a phone via the my o2 app as I was due an upgrade. It was meant to be next day delivery but after 3 day of waiting and my new phone not arriving I decided to phone the o2 customer services. An agen called Shannon answered, she mentioned that that on her system it shows the phone was delivered the next day, obviously I havent recieved it so she contacted the couriers. They hadnt a clue where the phone was and had to perform a driver review. All of this happened over a couple of hours and Shannon made certain I didnt speak to another advisor which meant I didnt have to constantle explain my situation. She was so lovely and constantly apologised for this issue which is not her nor o2's fault. My phone was delivered to my neighbour but no card was posted to let me know. I now have my phone and I am very thankful for all of Shannons help.",2
"I visited the o2 store in Wood Green and would like to thank Adrian for his very honest and informative customer service. He was very polite, helpful and far from pushy (which you can often get from a sales rep). He knew his stuff, explained things clearly, was completely transparent - made my customer experience a productive one so thank you once again.",2
"Visited O2 in Livingston Almondvale shop today with my Mum and was very impressed with Fiona, who was extremely helpful and ever so patient and informative. Excellent service provided by this member of staff.",2
"Have been a costumer for a right few years. Outstanding company. Network and coverage is second to none, great customer service, Always have gone the extra mile for me. It’s nice to use a company that makes you feel like your needs come first.",2
"In honestly I like O2 and the issues that I have had were resolved quickly and with little fuss. Over the years I’ve been a customer of all of the telecommunications companies and really only 02 have been worth while using and certainly the best company too use.I’m sure like most companies nowadays, there is moments when service is bad but I haven’t experienced this from 02 yet and hopefully I won’t.I’d recommend o2 and give 9/10*Tip* If your having trouble with your phone try contacting the manufacturer as well (Apple/Samsung etc) quite often they will just replace/repair  the handset without  all the hassle.",2
"My experience with O2 so far been great. I use a pay as you go sim, and it is the international version. I can ring EU for couple of pence a minute, which is great. I can also enjoy a free hot drink from Cafe Nero on a Tuesday or Wednesday and loads of other discounts with the Priority app.  Keep up the good work, O2!",2
Couldn't do enough for me when I received my handset and were great with setting up my phone for me.,2
"Excellent service yet again. You may need to wait a little while to be served, but it's always worth it. The customer service at Eastbourne O2 is amazing. Today,  however, it was better than ever! Thank you Kyle for all your help with choosing my new phone, and with transferring everything over. You really went above and beyond, and you're a credit to O2. No pushy sales tactics, just brilliant, old fashioned good customer service.  Thank you",2
Never had a problem with 02 been with them for about 6 years and every time I have a issue with paying the bill they are always so helpful. I could not fault them.,2
I upgraded my phone recently and the staff in the UK call centre found me a great deal and were really helpful.  I picked the phone up from a store where admittedly the staff weren't that bothered unless I bought something.  They told me to go to 134 Oxford Street to see if there was a guru there who could help me get it up and running as I'm not great with new technology.  I had tried to book a guru in advance but none were available and my home internet and landline had gone down so I couldn't get help that way.  I'm having medical treatment and need to be connected to the outside world.  The staff at 134 Oxford Street were lovely and more than made up for the other store. Even though no guru was available Tenzin kindly got the phone going and showed me how to use it.  I'm delighted with my phone and am very grateful for that store's amazing customer service.  I finally managed to book a guru to learn more about how my phone works and Danny in the Brixton store was very knowledgeable.,2
"I am on o2 pay as you go. Through my own fault my sim was blocked, the call center in South Africa was very friendly and restored my sim number as well as restoring the original ballance. I live in SA do not speak Africaans but the advisor spoke perfect English. As long as you get good service it does not have to be in the UK",2
"I’ve been from o2 for approx 4 months now, after moving from awful Vodafone. So far so good. The cost is reasonable, priority benefit and customer service is good.I like the fact that I can put a bar on my account and have add-on. I also receive warnings when I’m close to using up my data and calls allowance",2
"I cannot fault o2. I asked if I could send a Huawei GT watch back that I bought 5 weeks ago due to developing an allergic reaction to something in the watch and they were more then happy to either refund me or exchange it for something else to which I choose a fitbit versa. Thankyou o2, a lot better then my previous network",2
Excellent customer service. I had some problems with extra charges on my bill and phoned to query them. The customer service advisor (sadly forgot his name) was extremely helpful.He took the time to figure out what happened. Asked me if I was ok to wait to get his manager to look at it and then he told me that they could get back the charges. He also sat and calculated the correct amount including the VAT so that I would get every penny that was taken by accident.Very polite and reassuring over the phone and even wished me a good weekend. 10/10,2
"I contacted o2 via the live chat to query an upgrade .. I have a sim only plan so just wanted to add a device plan to this. The advisors on live chat couldn’t help me in anyway! To the point where I said no bother, I will leave and go back to three. They just accepted this and I closed the chat. I called 202 just to quickly discuss if there were any options and spoke to a lovely advisor called Craig. He was wonderful and upgraded my phone with no problems at all. The 5 star review is for Craig. Don’t use live chat it’s far too robotic!!",2
"Id like to thank the welcome security guys especially John who was so kind and went out of his way to provide us with a wheelchair to get our father to our destination, it helped to make our mother and fathers anniversary a bit more special, and he did it in his own time.",2
"I have been with o2 for 20 years. I had a great experience so far. Nothing to complain about at all.The prices are fair for what I get and they don't surprise you with out of the blue big price raises when your deal expire... I tried Virgin and Vodaphone, which were ok but Virgin kept hiking the prices up + you have to deal with loads of third parties; and vodaphone had intermittent connection at the time.O2 so far so good!",2
"Great customer service at O2 Harrow store. Haifa at O2 Harrow store was amazing. She helped me with setting up a 40gb data plan. She was awesome, quick, and very polite. Just great experience overall and fast network.",2
Been with O2 for over 3 years and its the only mobile provider ill be with. Great customer service. Great signal for 4G across the whole UK. Great and affordable prices to fit around me. Recommend to all!,2
"I've bought a new iPhone and Frank at o2 shop Fulham helped me to set up everything and switch from my old Samsung to the new phone, very happy with their service.",2
Today i had a pleasure of speaking to Stephanie in o2 branch in houndshill shopping centre my mom was Liliana and i were upgrading to new phones. Stephanie explained everything step by step and was absolutely lovely and amazing would recommend her to anyone without thinking great service and approach to the customer deserves a pay rise. Thank you for great experience Stephanie,2
"I've been with O2 ten years or more. On Saturday 4 May 2019 i phoned O2 to upgrade 2 phones and 2 tablets. Paul answered the pnone almost straight away.  From the start he was extremely polite, helpful and friendly in a professioal way.  I told him what I wanted and he led me through the procedure. As I was upgrading 4 devices it took a little while and was a bit repetitive however Paul remained upbeat and attentive throughout. He made sure he understood my needs and that I understood every stage. I must emphasise Paul was extremely clear in his pronunciations which helped me understand every aspect. He made me smile throughout the whole call and I came away very happy. Thank you Paul you are a real asset to O2!",2
Spoke with Emily on the phone about my Grandads phone bill and she was absolutely fantastic! She upgraded his contract to unlimited calls free of charge. He is house bound and this really helps him as he gets lonely so makes allot of calls. If I could give more stars I would! Thank you Emily,2
"Visited O2 New St, Bham today to buy a new phone for my husband. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Did all the changeover for us. Polite and friendly staff. Thank you to Scott and all the team.",2
Brilliant customer service on the phone from zubie Thankyou so much for your help and giving me information about my tarriff,2
"Been an O2 consumer/business customer for around 20 years, while we've had our fair share of problems over the years, they've always looked after me.  Had no issues when travelling to different countries.  Customer Services are good and coverage is excellent.",2
The only mobile phone network worth paying for.,2
"Extremely impressed with O2 customer service. I emailed about a small issue with regard to international data charges and was called back the next day by a very helpful agent who was able to resolve my issue within a couple of minutes. I do not usually write reviews, but was compelled to do so on this occasion as my previous experience of telephone companies is that customer service is a nightmare. Quite the opposite with O2. I am relatively new to O2, and will most definitely stay with them when customer service is of this high quality. Thank you to the agent I spoke to!",2
"I recently joined 02 and it is the best network I've ever been on, having tried Vodaphone and Virgin over the years.No issues with signal or the internet at all. Plus fantastic rewards on priority and money back on my spend so I'm quids in. Free Cafe Nero coffee, easter eggs, Thornton's mother's day chocs fantastic!",2
"Has an upgrade call with Peter Rigby, really helpful, listened to the issue and fixed it.I'd had a problem with my upgrade which he sorted",2
Ben the guru and staff at Aylesbury branch helped me and were patient with me.They all were wonderful. Thank you Ben the guru.I appreciated the help.I am 75year old you had great patience with me.10 stars to youValaine Bell..,2
Two weeks ago I bought a new phone from the o2 shop in Halifax which for me is quite a daunting task but I was looked after by a young lady called Emma and she made it a joy she was very knowledgeable and friendly she transferred everything I needed from my old phone to the new one and I was up running in no time. I would like to give my thanks to Emma and the O2 team in Halifax,2
"Excellent customer service when arranging for a new sim card to be delivered after my phone was unfortunately stolen. Made a stressful situation better, and the sim card arrived the following day. Thanks to 	Kamaljeet on live chat for the top service.",2
I must give 5 star to a kind lady called JADE she really show how professional she is ..I been having problems with o2 for a month now...but hopefully is resolved Jade thank you for you patience a kindness and your attitude made me calm and  I realized that Some people who work in costumer services at the o2 They need to learn loads with you thank you 🙏 I wish I could give u ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,2
"Never had any issues, been with them for years.",2
I don’t work for o2 I am a genuine customerBut I have had nothing but excellent customer service.I called them today as my payment was gonna be late they did a promise to pay for 10 days advised there would be a £3.50 late payment charge totally ok it is my fault.They understood my predicament and reassured me everything was ok. Fantastic 5 stars from meThank you o2,2
"I’ve been with o2 many years on pay and go never had a problem, I don’t think I’d use any other network",2
Twelve years with O2Never had a problemTariffs clear and service pretty goodThe only downside is roaming is not cheap outside the tourist areas!,2
"Ok, well My Son had had a text message that said ""thanks for subscribing to jamjar, £4.50 will be debited from your account every fortnight"" or something to that effect. My Son was confused and he said he had not subscribed to any one nor clicked on any links, hes a bright lad at university doing business studies and is very good with money and things like this so i knew he was telling the truth. i contacted o2 fraud team and the first person said we had to reply STOP to the number then ring a number that he gave me. My Son had deleted the text message knowing this was a scam and so we couldnt reply STOP to it, we tried the number and 3 loud beeps then dead, i though we had been told the wrong info from o2 so i rang again and what a great guy that sorted us, his name is Mohammed (Magic Mo) and he immediately refunded me the money, put a block on anymore coming through and also personally rang the company for me whilst i was on hold, sure enough i got text messages from o2 confirming all what he said. Not only did he help us he was really funny guy who made us both feel at ease and also made us smile, thanks MAGIC MO, you really are an inspiration to customer services. We need more like you. I really hope that this message gets back to him because these kind of people need to know they are doing a fantastic job. Thank you",2
"Kris in re-contracts was awesome, he made my decision very easy and was a pleasure to speak to, please make sure he gets this review.",2
My partner and i have been with O2 for quite some time now and have had little to no real issues. But i just wanted to say how incredibly helpful the staff in the Northfield store are! Pardeep was an absolute delight to sit with and he helped us with everything we needed in store and was really friendly.. he is a credit to the store!,2
Zara from Birms New Street is absolutelty amazing. Helped me with my upgrade,2
Got accepted the 9th June 2018 received the next day. I added another phone the 5th January and delivery the next day. Such an easy process. The customer service is excellent always helpful.,2
"Best phone company I used,  sends back cash rewards for topping up, cheap rates for the occasional user.  Sends out free sim cards to the UK.  If you lose your phone convenient to get your old number back.",2
Donna in the O2 Store in High Street Exeter was extremely helpful and fast in getting me sorted with my new Sony. Thanks Donna.,2
O2 Aylesbury has been an excellent when it comes to customer service. They made to a point that their customer will be satisfied and completely happy of their service. That is why I have been with O2 for more than 10 years because of their high standard which is excellent. Thanks to Jake who has been brilliant and very professional and so ever been so patient with us. O2 is highly recommended!!!,2
"Have recently subscribed to O2 Classic 3-2-1 PAYG scheme.  As you can tell it's pay as you go and you pay 3p for calls, 2p for texts and 1p per gig of internet.I now have two phones on this scheme and have to say it's fine. The rates are the same as that charged by 'Three' but, for me, the coverage seems better than Three. Also the O2 customer service has been absolutely superb.  They are based in South Africa - I have to say they have answered the phone quicker than anyone else .... (although I admit Asda Pay As You Go service was excellent too) ...and the O2 advisors have been great and were very polite, helpful and well informed. The PAC transfer from Asda to O2 was successful on both occasions. Obviously the other reviews reflect differing views but I can only speak as I find.",2
Flush the customer services fantatic well done,2
Very very happy with my experience from O2 customer services! Can’t thank them enough for their help,2
"Despite all the disruption in the last couple of days, the company have been absolutely fantastic over the years. I have had various company phones with other servers and I can't begin to tell you the comparison for me is obvious.I won't be switching any time soon. Thanks everyone at o2.",2
Have helped me when late business payers have not paid on time. They have no tied a rope over my connection like other provider stories I have heard.This problem is an equipment supplier upgrade issue not 02. It happens with office equipment.,2
Great service in o2 shop when setting up new sim,2
"Switched over from EE, had a good experience with o2 so far.",2
Thank you to Janice for all your help finally SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT SHES DOING!!!!! Unlike the previous person I spoke to that was arguing with my saying I was going to be charged £97 to change my direct debit dateMASSIVE SHOUT OUT TO JANICE!!!!,2
"O2 have been continously fantastic looking after me as a customer for over 15 years,I've had the phone for many years and also I had their broadband at one point (only reason I no longer do is because they sold to Sky) however they have always solved problems, give credit when needed (even at times when I have accidentally gone over minutes and not realised they've credited) so honestly, they're one of the best companies within the UK by far!",2
"We bought a new phone and an 02 contract via a reseller. It has all worked out well, so far.Looking at previous reviews for this company, as well as other mobile service providers, it would appear that there's much these companies can do to make our lives better and improve their procedures.More power to Ofcom to act, for starters and more competition.",2
"What's with the bad reviews? I have been with 02 for years, great company, no issues at all!! I give them 5 stars..",2
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I have just upgraded my phone with them. I was able to do it online, no trouble at all. Got the tariff I wanted, and sorted out my insurance. I ordered my new phone on a Tuesday morning, I had by lunchtime the next day. The delivery driver gave me an hour slot between 12-1 for delivery, so I didn't have to wait around all day. Very impressed with the service. That's why I've stuck with them.",2
"O2 has Brilliant Customer Service.Every time I need to check or change something on my account I just chat with them online, friendly staff, very helpful, always will give you the best tariff, will do some discounts.Nice Quick and EasyI wish  that other companies had the same Customer service",2
"I had a problem with my account, I phoned customer services,The lady that I spoke to was most helpful and explained what I was doing wrong, she has set me up with a new o2 Bundle as the one I had was dated,  o2 customer services have always listened and acted positively when I have phoned them, an excellent service,",2
"When starting a new O2 contract it's best to block all Direct bills to mobile, Premium bar and International Bar to start, you can always remove the bars later by calling customer service. On new contract or upgrade from 1 October 2018 you can now set a Spend cap at £0 to protect you from unexpected bills as you can always change this by calling customer service or MyO2 App. Most people on this form don't quite understand what a contract means. You are agreeing to pay them a monthly charge for 1 or 2 years plus any extras charges which you must pay on time. If you cannot guarantee you can afford it for the year(s) don't sign up use pay as you go no excuses please. Look after your phone and insure it, 2 years is a long time paying for something you have broken or had it stolen. I have used O2 (Cellnet), Vodafone, EE (One2One, T-Mobile & Orange), Tesco, Virgin and Three for over 32 years and I find now it's easier to buy my phone outright and look for the SIM only deals. It's so easy to change network with a PAC code and your number changes over the next working day and automatically cancels your existing contract.",2
"Best service I've ever had from a mobile phone store. I'd been with EE for years, but found the staff in that store unhelpful and unwilling to fix anything unless it meant selling you something new; the OPPOSITE with O2. After not having any success with EE I went into their store on Chapel Street, Southport, and they were willing to help me without the hard sell. I didn't commit that day, but went back and since then have had amazing help from Anna, Ken and Jo, who are always so friendly and willing to go out of their way for you. Prices better than EE, their knowledge and expertise far exceeds the competition, there's never that awful wait time that makes you reluctant to even go into a mobile phone store for help, so overall, a complete winner for me! I purchased their own brand ""1+"" phone- was going to go for the S9 and really was looking for a great camera, but the 1+ was the winner. Am delighted with my phone!",2
"Good Company with practical prices on iPhones which I was looking for will be returning for a new contract.I have just recently moved from EE and their greedy antics for new iPhones is just vulgar.£80+ for new iPhone and 3 gb of data what use is that to anyone when EE and most sites such you towards the internet they forget that when they offer overpriced contracts and dish out 3gb of data its obscene and they should be ashamed of themselves.O2 have been nothin but helpful 50gb of data, free calls, free texts best that EE.",2
"After dropping my s8+ i decided to claim on my insurance, i have to admit 02 where brilliant. They asked a few questions over the phone, arranged to collect it next day then confimed a day later they had recieved it. Just a few hours later i recived an email to confirm i would have a new phone the next day! Super fast service and great customer service. Thanks 02",2
"I am continually surprised with the efficiency of O2 Customer Service and also their Insure team so would like to extend my thanks to them. My phone got stolen on Saturday for the second time in a year and they were just absolutely brilliant at resolving it extremely quickly. Everyone I spoke to on the phone were kind, compassionate and sorted it at incredible speed.Yes, I do find O2 average in terms of price; however, I honestly think it is worth it because with other companies the customer service lacks where it absolutely should be. For these reasons I've been with o2 for 10 years and will continue to be with them. Thank you O2.",2
"I've been with o2 since the first iPhone and think they offer a fantastic service.Recently upgraded to the iPhone XS Max, was due to upgrade in November, but o2 offered to cancel the remaining £70 left on my current phone contract and upgraded me early.Phoned customer services to check some details on my order and the lady I spoke to was really helpful.I also needed a new SIM card for a PAYG number I have. I used LiveChat for this, and the agent was great. Got my SIM card and I am really pleased!Thanks o2!",2
"Been with o2 for many years and like the way they do things which is simple and start forward,have renewed with them again just last week.Can not fault them they are helpful when u need them when things go wrong or to check what the fault is in my area.Always looking to improve the service.",2
"The service I received in the Carmarthen branch today was excellent.  The two chaps were friendly,knowledgeable and polite. An absolute credit to your company.  Good people are hard to come by. Whatever you do, don't let them leave. I've already recommend that branch to several colleagues.Many thanks.Alice",2
"I decided finally to give my ancient iPhone 4S heave ho with something a bit more up to date. I could do so and get more minutes on my contract and yet still pay less per month than I was with my 4S (silly me for sticking with it for so long). Nonetheless this did require my number to be transferred to a new SIM which, mercifully O2 did for me without complication or delay. Just to wrap up, I ordered my replacement phone at 18:00 on Wednesday, it arrived with me at 16:00 on Thursday - now that's efficiency. In all my years with O2, they've seldom let me down and I would not hesitate in recommending them to anyone.",2
Love my iPhone X on my upgrade. Good deal!!,2
"Absolutely lovely experience ! Called up to ask to pay for my bill later on , received top service and got it all sorted.  I work in customer service myself and I hope I'll get to speak like that on the phone one day ! Thank you Matt from Customer Service !!!",2
"Good prices, good service via chat, FB & 202, Priority & O2 app are fun, no dodgy bills. Best of big 4 for contract & paygo. Only network that does internal number migration too.",2
"I've been with O2 going on a decade, and I have to say, it's unlikely that I will go anywhere else while they're around. I've never had any issues with signal, or customer service, their insurers have always sorted me out quickly and without any hassle (And I break A LOT of phones!) and my upgrades have always been easy.I also LOVE the O2 Priority benefits. I use them constantly for ticket purchases, and meals out - their offers are always attractive and relevant to me. It's a real draw to being with O2.",2
"Been with O2 for many years and got to say - think they are great.  Reinforced today when I moved my daughter's account over.  She had been with Three - shocking/awful customer service.  Phoned O2 about a bolt on which I had unwittingly signed up to with UNICEF, they sorted it instantly.  Three.... I was passed round 3 different people, insincere service, shabby.  Glad the family are all now with O2",2
Just taken out another contract with O2.They always provide good network coverage and the 02 rewards system is a nice bonus.,2
"After a crisis involving much confusion and distress, O2 came out on top. Immediate replacement of Sims, advice, updates and support. O2 White Rose, Leeds, staffed exceptionally. Especially Sam. Up and beyond the call of duty, patience in abundance, calm, friendly and above all professional and no pressures.",2
Jody from the billing department has helped me out a lot and gave extremely good customer service.Friendly!Listens to you!And also treats you as a person rather than an opportunity.Lovely staff member you have here named Jody! 10/10!!!!,2
Great company with a fantastic rewards scheme. Staff in shops are friendly and the tariffs are compative.,2
"I have a periodic problem with O2 that means occasionally some contacts can't ring or text me even though I can ring and text them. No one at O2 has ever been able to get to the bottom of it and indeed liked to shrug off responsibility and pass the buck to the other networks. HOWEVER, yesterday at Surrey Quays branch, lovely Naz was determined to get to the bottom of it and, with the help of the Network tech team, solved it! I'm ever so grateful to Naz and think he deserves 10 stars! Turns out a network upgrade (I think) has the effect of no longer recognising numbers originally ported from other providers. It's as if the network thinks the numbers are no longer in use.",2
I had managed to drop my phone Have been with 02 for years Decided to visit the 02 shop on the Parade in Leamington Spa Warwickshire Dina the assistant there could not have been more helpful. MyOriginal phone was beyond saving but gave me good advice and sorted new one with no problem When my contract is due. I will visit the shop rather than use on line. Thanks againVaughan,2
"Every single time I've gone into O2 over the last few years the Gurus have been so helpful, kind and patient.Simply wonderful customer service in my opinion",2
I’ve been a happy customer with O2 for a number of years. I generally get a decent network connection and I feel I’ve got a great tarrif price.,2
I’ve been with these guys for the longest. Deal with issues pronto.,2
"Had to close some accounts for my husband but due to his poor English it was a struggle to talk to them as they wouldn’t speak to me but my husband even when we went into the branch they told us to call again.I called yesterday and I spoke to Zola and he was so kind and helpful. He spoke to me throughout the call so I could translate to my husband and he asked some security questions which I did then have to pass the phone onto my husband and tbh having done that before they would always say that my husband needed to speak but they always failed to understand him . Zola helped us with our enquiry and then transferred us to Sadam who also was so kind and helpful because of Zola and Sadam I don’t think we would have got our things done! Sadam was very nice and explained promptly to us and answered all our enquiries . He would put us on hold to actually go and get the right info ! He even advised us to recycle our old phone.I only gave o2 5* because of Zola and Sadam, or else I tbh had worse experience with o2!I was so admired by their time and effort and their service I honestly never write reviews but I was treated so well that I couldn’t resist!They were so patient and dealt so well with usI wasn’t sure about their names as I only got to ask one of them but today I received a text regarding the service and now I have their names and tbh they need a pay rise ASAP! Even a promotion😜Because no one has ever taken that much effort into work like them ... most of o2 customer service only want to get rid of you ASAP and end your call -_-",2
The best car insurance I ever had.Cost-effective solutions and direct client approach.Flexible and cheapI could never have thought that a telephonic brand could have offered this massive service.Very good Job,2
"Went in to the spindles store in Oldham town centre and was seen by Mark. He was knowledgeable, helpful and an all round nice guy that gave honest advice and helped me find the right deal. Working in retail myself, I understand the importance of returning customers and it’s safe to say next time I need a phone I’ll be returning due to marks excellent customer service👍👍",2
On Monday I need to contact O2 to get three number changed two new numbers I spoke to a lady called Sally in South Africa she was first class and provided me with everything that I needed I was wowed I'd like O2 if they read this to pass on my thanks for a job well done JP,2
The best customer service out there bar none. Friendly knowledgable staff who are clearly striving to make a difference. Have never had a bad customer experience in the last 7 years. Stands out as Vodafone previously were dreadful dreadful dreadful.,2
noticed so many bad reviews so thought id chip in. Been with o2 for over 10 years. Never any issues. Very happy still. Sometimes people only write reviews when they've got a rant :),2
Lovely customer service. Made EE seem even worse which I didn't think was possible!Very easy to get hold of someone on instant chat if you have a problem. Always desperate to help you- I had a technical issue that was fixed straight away. I was apologised to for the error.I've also been mad to feel like being loyal customer actually means something to o2. o2 priority is an added bonus that rewards customers. I've also had the best reception since I switched from EE. I frequently went without service until I switched o2!,2
"Great service - whenever I have an issue they really work hard to solve it. I moved away from o2 because I found a rolling monthly contract elsewhere cheaper, but after 2 months I came back - can’t fsult the service.",2
"Great customer service received from ELROY- customer advisor at O2! Very professional, helpful and proactive guy! Thanks for sorting out my case! Would definitely stay with O2  😊",2
"Ok I can see there is a tone of bad reviews here but I honestly love 02 I haven’t had one single problem with them, I never loose connection, there’s 02 refresh which is extremely handy, there’s so many good points to 02. I was with Vodafone for a long time and they were a extremely poor company compared to 02 so 5* I know this may seem or appear like a joke review considering all the bad remarks against 02 on here but it’s a honest genuine opinion from my experience with them.",2
"I've been a customer for probably 10 years or so now - and never, ever had a single problem. For a telecoms company I think this is pretty good. Thank you for all your excellent service over the years.",2
Just spoke to Matthew on live chat and he went above and beyond to help me. Fab service. Makes a pleasant change. Thank you Matthew,2
"Upgraded my phone online yesterday and had realised once it had been dispatched that I had ordered a 32gb instead of a 128gb, once the phone was delivered this afternoon I took it to my local o2 store (west quay Southampton) still completely sealed where I was greeted by a man leaning on a counter who couldn’t of cared any less about what I had to say and told me there was nothing he could do and sent me on my way, I then thought I would try my luck in the o2 shop 2 minutes away the above bar Southampton store where one of your employees was so helpful and said he was unsure on whether he could help because it had been purchased online but asked us to take a seat whilst he went to find out what he could do, a man named Ben then came over and said he would need to contact someone to see if it was possible, which he then found out it was, he then started the process, he was very friendly, had a laugh, recommended some apps and sent me on my way with the phone I had wanted all along, had it not of been for Ben today my score would of been 1 star! Although it was my fault for ordering the wrong phone and had Ben of found out he couldn’t help I would of appreciated his efforts anyway! But I’m very pleased with my new phone! Thanks Ben!",2
Great customer service. Never had a problem with them across my several devices and years with them. Much better than EE and Vodafone who I’ve been with in the past,2
The best network provider. After a rubbish 6 months with another provider was so pleased to be able to have 3&4g on my mobile. I love 02 and have had to increase my data due to being able to use it in my area,2
Poor customer service. Issue still remains. Will be cancelling direct debit until it is sorted and at end of contract will not be with o2.I have amended this review because O2 have addressed all of my concerns and I continue to be a customer. I have even taken out car insurance with them.,2
"Seem's to be some real hating on O2, which to be honest surprises me...maybe more to do with the fact people are more likely to share bad experiences perhaps?Personally I've had nothing but good for all the years I have been with them. coverage is spot on, service is great, perks are fantastic (love my free coffees and early gig ticket sales). Also love how O2 where the first of the main networks in the UK to split out the phone and network costs making upgrading easier. Also made roaming abroad not cost the earth and will be part of standard usage in 2018.So yeah, feel this positive review might be just a drop in the ocean of bad  ones but hey, there are some of us who are happy with 02 :)",2
Excellent customer service from Michael in the Manchester call center! 🙂,2
Just great. I moved from Vodafone 12 months ago as they had become truly shocking. I've O2 to be a breath of freshair. The help instore is great. The network is more reliable that Vodafone's and with better coverage in my experience. 12+ months in they've just called me to pro-active offer to reduce my price for the same sim only bundle! Brilliant.,2
"I have been a user of O2. Mobile for well over 20 years. They have nearly always been fast, efficient and trouble free. The one time I complained they were fast, efficient and friendly at responding to my complaint and went out of their way to help, resolving the issues almost immediately. Unlike most companies these days they responded and resolved the problem and apologised for the inconvenience not within months, weeks, days or even hours. But within minutes. Yes minutes. And it was resolved by a section manageress, showing that they took the complaint seriously and cared about their customers. Faultless service from O2 customer services and faultless service from O2 ever since. One of the few companies that I would not hesitate in recommending, and as far as pay as you go is concerned, one of the best.",2
"I absolutely love being an 02 customer! They are efficient and helpful in every respect. I receive great 02priority treats every week for being a customer, and they go out of their way to keep my bills as low as possible. I am also always up to date with the latest handset.",2
"Called in the 02 shop at the Deppdale Centre, Preston this morning.I just needed a new SIM for an iPhone I didn't buy from 02.Really good, prompt and very friendly service.  A credit to 02.",2
O2 are the best phone network that I have ever been with. Excellent customer service,2
"Been with O2 ever since they took over BT Cellnet (20 years?).  Wonderful, very friendly and helpful staff. If there is ever a problem, it's sorted quickly and efficiently. Always received the right advice on new handsets and deals. The best network around! 😀",2
"I have been a customer with o2 for years and never had any issues. I fancied and early upgrade so I used their live chat function today to see if I could arrange this.I ended up speaking with a manager and got a great deal on a new handset.Overall, very happy with o2 and the service they provide.",2
"Visited O2 shop at Westwood Cross today. We were apologised to firstly as they were extremely busy. However, after only a few minutes we were attended to by a young man who I believe was David Saunders, he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, he certainly knew what he was talking about. We came away with better terrific than we had had previously and my husband's new phone was up and running in no time. Thank you David for your personal service today.",2
Just had a very good experience with o2 customer service. They supplied me with a like-for-like temporary replacement phone and credited me a month's bill due to an on-going very poor experience with customer service at Huawei who have had my phone in for repair for almost five weeks.I should have given my phone to o2 for repair but I stupidly contacted the manufacturer directly - last time I make that mistake.,2
Been with O2 for 3 months now on a SIM only deal. Extremely happy with network coverage and internet speeds in West London. So far didn't need to call Customer Service for anything major... Glad I left the other network for O2.I tried all the big mobile phone players... O2 is on top of the list.,2
My boyfriend really needed a new phone and contract and after being turned down by EE was getting worried he wouldn't be getting one however Olivia in the west quay Southampton branch was super helpful was able to a great phone and contract for a good monthly price! Very happy with her service!,2
"Amazing service from O2.  My daughters phone was stolen on Sunday night. Visited the Notting hill store on Monday am. They helped us get a crime number on line, reordered the phone, the replacement phone came the very next morning before 10am.  Great service from staff. Well done",2
I used O2 chat today to get my previous phone unlocked. Customer service was top notch from Kevin.  Thank you O2 you did a great job today,2
I've just come back to O2 with a sim only pay as you go after spending 2 years with another network never having a signal indoors.The main reason for returning to O2 is because I always get a good signal both anywhere  indoors and outdoors.The £10 monthly pay as you go bundles are great valueThe one time I've spoken to customer services when moving my number back to O2 they were very helpful and polite.,2
Excellent service at the Tottenham Hale branch this morning was having trouble with my new Samsung phone... staff  could not do enough for me....well done good to see such great service...,2
"Been with O2 for years. If we ever get a problem our local O2 store is brilliant, manned by young switched on staff who will do anything to help. Never had anything but exemplary and friendly service. Faultless.",2
"Good network, reliable, helpfull customer service and friendly app. Been with them for the last 10months. I tried before giffgaff, Three, Vodafone and O2 is so far the best network for my needs.",2
"Spoke to Derek in customer services at lunchtime on 12.05.17 who was fantastic, he was cheeful , helpful, and dealt with my query in a quick proffessional manner, o2 have always been great when ive dealt with them but Derek shone like a little star.",2
"best rates, easy to use website",2
"I have now left o2 and moved to another provider due to an introductory offer.Moving companies has made me appreciate how good O2 were. Everything they did was efficient. Even leaving O2 was easy. It was easy to get through on the phone, they did not try to hard sell, they just did what they were supposed to do.Having used Orange, Virgin Mobile and BT I would say that O2 are the best of the bunch",2
"I went to o2 in Shrewsbury  yesterday. I am a senior agent in customer services, I can honestly say the service I receive from Declan was outstanding. I have upgraded my contract to the new samsung a5. He was so helpful and made it all stress free. Please pass on this feedback and tell him he is great at his job.",2
"Over the years I used O2, I had very few issues and the customer service was always a pleasure!",2
"I ordered a 25GB Unlimited Minutes & Texts SIM-ONLY plan for £25 from O2 last year.I was emailed every step of the way during the progress of my SIM, all the way to dispatch.Once it came, I popped it into my handset and realised that 4G wasn't working.I went on the o2 site and spoke to an online agent who informed me that the 4G bolt on needed to be activated.They turned on 4G and told me it would take 24 hours to activate.The next day it was on perfectly.4G has been quick. no billing issues or anything else. Just a smooth service so far.",2
"Brilliant customer service. Been with them for 10years or more now and I was setting up a contract on the phone the other day with a very nice fella called Liam, very kind/helpful.",2
"I have to say, I was not with O2 for all that long as the 3G/4G coverage in the West Country wasn't great ....... yet.However I chopped and change tariffs, had reason to change my handset in store and perform quite a few changes to my tariffs.Not once did it get messed up, the O2 app was always spot on and billing too. I can't imagine the pain I'd have suffered if I'd tried to get VF to do any of this!In fact due to EE's poor indoor coverage I wanted to return to O2 but they can no longer offer the SIM deal I used to have :-(Anyway, regarding customer service, billing and shop staff in Falmouth, Cornwall ....... Well done O2",2
I've had an issue with O2 company that was lasting for 3 months until I spoke with guru Thomas Greenhalgh and fixed the problem when I didn t expected anymore.Really professional and great man! Thanks a lot!,2
"I went into the Manchester Arndale store today to purchase a new phone. The service I received from Sarah was absolutely brilliant. I am not a big mobile phone user. I only have one for emergencies really. Sarah sorted me out with just what I needed and then actually sorted the phone out ready for me to use. I also wanted to change my contract to one that suited my needs more than the one I had and she sorted all that out for me as well !!!!! I was absolutely amazed at the brilliant service she provided.I've used the same store a few times in the past and always been happy with the service, but today was exceptional. Thank you Sarah.",2
Must say a big thank you to the manager and staff members Laura and Scott for o lot of patient and helpful assistance today.  This is in marked contrast to the experience at the Kirkcaldy 02 shop.Problems completely resolved in a friendly and competent way.Many thanksIan,2
Customer Complaints team resolved my issue.,2
For 5 years I had a mobile contract with 02 via Carphone warehouse.Never had a problem and never had to contact them.,2
"After spending 2 years on the iphone 6, i thought i was gonna cancel the contract and just find another phone company but i decided to stay and upgrade toa iphone 7 and my monthly payments went down from £20 a month to £17 a month. Nice one O2 !",2
Excellent service!,2
I have delt with 02 on many occasions and never had any problems there staff are very helpful and hard working.  They would do anything to make it alot easier. I would send anyone to this company that's how confident I am.,2
"In the office i work i have people telling me that i should move to another network for better 4G, more internet data, better coverage or cheaper bills, then i hear the same people saying how they have or are changing networks because of problems they are having. I have been with O2 for about 15 years and have never had an issue with them.  Always offer a good service with good deals and the refresh package is second to none and O2 priority is excellent.  Taking into account all the issues i hear from my work colleagues have had with their networks i don't see O2 is any worse than the others, i would love to see more reward for loyalty, but then that applies to a majority of companies.Keep up the good work.",2
"I came over from a different Network,from using my P.A.C Code to speaking to them on the phone, there was one issue but got sorted out immediately and then they credited £10.00 pounds too on my account, better coverage and Network-can't fault them at all. Don't know what these whingers are going on about they've been very helpful and not had a problem.Keep up the good work o2My Number is 07712492916",2
Would recommend everyone ✔But stay away  from EE,2
"Thank you to O2, Merseyway, Stockport, for superb service.  My much-valued old phone suddenly packed up, only functioning for a few seconds at a time.  The assistant was very helpful in explaining how to use my choice of new phone.  Even better, after a lot of effort and time, he finally managed to blue tooth across all my old contacts, which I would have lost otherwise.  Given the old phone would only function for seconds, it was amazing he managed to do this.  He also transferred all my photographs.  I am really grateful for the excellent service and would definitely recommend this shop.",2
No problems with this service except when coverage was confirmed to be low in my area.,2
I have been with O2 for many years now after leaving Orange due to stupidly high bills - going over my allowance constantly - and really poor coverage. I have nothing bad to say about the service provided by O2 apart from when someone fraudulently upgraded my account to a blackberry from an address in London - but they dealt with this superbly once they knew about it. Have recommended and my dad swapped after being with orange for 20 years.,2
I switched to a sim only contract. 1 month later I realised I needed more data allowance than I had - O2 have a 3 month policy before switching but the guy on the phone convinced his manager to switch me to a higher data tariff for less money. Best service ever.,2
Excellent customer service me and my wife received from George Wade at Colliers Wood branch.Top class experience. You need more staff like him. His services should be rewarded. Mr Nurse.,2
"I have been using the live online chat for a while now and every time I am 100% satisfied. The people are polite, concise, helpful, know hat they are talking about, and it never lasts longer than 15 mins. My phone was fixed within the blink of an eye too. I highly recommend the live chat.",2
"Never had any problems with O2.They don't charge for customer service, like EE do.They allow pay as you go customers to use 3g for £1, which is good for emergencies. EE makes you sign up to a £10 pack that only gives you 1GB.I've always had good experiences with their customer support.Would recommend.",2
Excellent customer service. Had an issue with my phone Matt sorted it out quickly. He was excellent I'd employ him tomorrow. Credit to 02 and the Dover store,2
I've been with o2 for about ten years. In this time I've had no issues with them at all over mobile contracts or broadband (back when they provided broadband). Their phones can be expensive - I bought my phone outright from another company and have a sim-only contract that works absolutely fine. Good coverage and uptime. Would recommend to friends and family.,2
"I absolutely love o2 , they are amazing and have a really good customer service. They also go out of there way to help people , well they have helped me a lot , i got a new contract with them at beginning of May 2016 and the phone came the next day and I have got the new iPhone 6s and they helped me set it up over the phone because I didn't have a clue how to set my Apple ID up and they talked me through it , they also told me if I couldn't afford the first months bill all in one I could pay it in two parts amazing highly recormend",2
"Ok, to start with, I've switched to o2 a couple of years ago and during my time with them, i lost my phone with the sim card. Went online and spoke to one of their gurus on chat. They sorted everything out straight away, old sim card blocked, new sim card with my number on the way, received it the next day. God I love o2. I'm on holiday now abroad and thanks to o2 travel bolt on I had activated months ago, i don't have to worry about using data or receiving phone calls. I can just use my phone as i do in the uk for £1.99 a day,no limit. My partner is on ee and every time we travel, it's the same story. He rings them up before we go to activate roaming just to having to get i touch with them again when it doesn't work. He'll be switching to o2 as soon as his contract is over. Well done o2, that's how it's done.",2
"I have been a customer with 02 for around 5 years.  I have had my issues as with any large organisation over the years.  I am writing this because over the last few years I have noticed O2 have made significant improvements in the way they conduct business (for me personally anyway).  I shop at a number of O2 stores but I would like to mention the team at Galleria in Hatfield.  They are professional but relaxed and always smiling.  The even remembered us the last time we went in.Another fantastic improvement has been their online payment system.  This used to be the worst part of my month as Im not on DD and I have 3 bills to pay. They have improved the system so much and it makes my life a lot easier.  This tells me they are focusing on continuous improvement and thinking about the customer me.Now, check out some of my other reviews and you will understand I can be critical, but in this case well done O2.  In my experience you are not perfect, but you are a million times better than companies like Vodafone!Keep improving.Paul Rhodes",2
"I can see a large number of bad reviews on here for O2. However, set up a SIM only contract with them for my mum. Her number was ported from another provider very quickly and hassle free and no bother with O2 customer service.The contract is a bit pricey and could be more competitive, compared to some other providers, but you do get what you pay for. Mobile Signal in her area is good too.I hope O2 try and address the bad experience that other reviews on here have had, it would be nice to think a company of that size would try.",2
"I have been with O2 on and off for over 10years (off because I went abroad) and compared to other companies they have given me a good experience throughout this time. If I ever have a problem I actually like calling them (which is not the case with other companies) because firstly I can understand them (English spekaing people, no call centre in India), secondly they always help, explain well, waiting times are very short, when in the queue the music is nice (and does not make me fall asleep or burst my ears). Bills are well explained, easy to look up, same goes for checking your left over minutes, text, data from your plan. I love the perks of O2 priority, in fact have gotten many presents for my son for FREE this way (and he was a happy little boy) and love the £1 lunch Mondays.Anyone looking for a hassle free, easy to deal with plan and company might want to check out O2. Even when I left them it was easy to obtain my PAC Code, no hard sales tactics, no wasting my time, instead a friendly ' Is there anything we can do?'. This is how it should be and this is why I went right back to them when I came back to the UK.A system that works, friendly and helpful customer service....thank you O2.",2
"I've been with O2 for six years now, first as a Pay & Go customer and now currently as a Pay Monthly customer, and I've never encountered any major issues. Just recently, after going through a painful two month ordeal with a certain Hong Kong based online electronics retailer, I ordered a sim-free Sony Xperia Z5 from O2's online store and the item was delivered to my local O2 branch the following day without problem. It was totally worth spending the little bit extra to buy a phone from a reputable company.In terms of their customer service, whenever I have an issue or query, or simply need my number changed, I find the online chat service offered by O2 to be very good - with most matters sorted within minutes.The only issue I've had over the years is, since moving to my current address, I have never been able to take out a new contract directly with O2. Instead I have had to acquire a Pay Monthly contract with O2 through Carphone Warehouse, such was the case with my current contract. But I suspect that's more to do with the credit check company rather than with O2 itself.",2
Took 2 hours to up grade as the email service was playing up and couldn't confirm my contract and give me a link. Paid £9.99 to have the phone delivered between 6.00pm and 10pm tonight. It was delivered to my neighbour at 2.00pm and the guy said we are a bit early. All in all a totally abysmal service. My advice is go elsewhere as o2 are a massive failure. I do not give them 5 stars that came up automaticly I would give them minus 500.,2
"Went in the other day as I had bought myself a recon Apple iphone 5, but not from them. I was expecting short shift as I walked passed all the new shiny phones they sell, but no, what I got was the most patient and helpful 'Stacey' who with the manager made me a new mini sim card. I am already an O2 customer but I got a tariff to suit my needs, nothing more. I can honestly say that the customer service was excellent, even on a busy Saturday. My son and I are both O2 customers and we are both planning on staying with them. Well done O2 in Brentwood, Essex, maybe some of the other O2 employees should spend a day there 'training'! Ask for Stacey, the most patient person ever.",2
My wife and I have been 02 customers for about 6 years.  We moved house recently and regrettably due to poor reception on our mobile phones we had to switch providers.  Over the years 02 have provided an excellent service and their staff have always been helpful.  Other mobile phone companies especially Vodafone could learn a lot about how to treat its customer from 02.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this company,2
We as a household have been with o2 for many years and never have we not been satisfied with them.Always helpful and sort out any problems we have .Very rarely do we suffer any signal problems .We find them excellent and even though sometimes there tarriffs can be more expensive we find it more benifical  to stay with them as the service they provide so out weighs any other mobile network we had previously been with..Thanks o2,2
"For those of you in London, my O2 coverage has been far superior since I swicthed from EE. The internet runs faster and I have less dropped calls.The customer service centre always resolve my issues, though sometimes they do keep you on hold for longer than you would like.I've renewed my contract with O2 for another year, even though I could pay less with another provider.",2
"Love O2, best mobile phone company I have been with. Stuck with them for several years and have No plans to move as a Customer.I recently added my Partner to my Contract. All good.Looking forward to my Upgrade in a few months.The only downside is when O2 goes down in our Area. But doubt we are the Only ones this happens too.Always found Customer services in store and online very helpful myself.",2
I like o2. I used them years ago without issue and I also had my broadband with them until they sold to sky. Their customer service was always second to none so I returned to them or my latest contract on a really great deal. Sadly it wasn't to be as the signal in my area wasn't very good and 3g in my area was non existent so I have had to cancel under the 14 day cooling off. However they were delightful about the whole thing and really helpful. I will update further if it was all too good to be true but for now....I wish I could have stayed with them!,2
"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Edge s7 phone at 6.30 at night and it arrived next morning.  I did it through live chat. It was superb.  Today I wanted to get my old number back and didn't have a clue how to do it so used Live Chat again.  I got a guru within seconds of logging on.  Abishek was chatting to me within seconds of logging on- he was pleasant and very knowledgeable- he answered my query perfectly and activated the number. Perfect customer service experience twice in one week and delighted with my s7... it's powerful, beautiful, the camera is amazing and it is a million times more durable than any other phone on the market.",2
"Very.co.uk should be trained by your staff, they are always helpful and rectify any issues there and then... Been with 02 for 5 years and have received excellent service throughout",2
"spoke to Tracy at o2 about my tariff and in no time at all she changed to something more suitable, no fuss, thank you Adrian Gardner",2
Great service thanks,2
"I have been an O2 pay monthly customer for almost 5 years. I decided to upgrade early for my birthday as I'm on the 'refresh' tariff. Paid the remaining £100 balance for my old phone and ordered a Samsung S6.I ordered it to be delivered the next day before 10.30am.The phone arrived at 7.04am the next day, which was great because I do the school run from 8.30am-9am.Absolutely no issues with delivery or the actual phone which I have now owned for just under a week.I also called O2 to change my phone number which they managed to do quickly. The new number was active within the hour.I rarely have to contact o2 customer services, but when I do I feel that the staff always deal with me in a professional  manner.",2
I rang up trying to get my grandparents reconnected with their pay as you go sim as BT landline unavailable leaving them vulnerable.Straight through to payasyougo line (unlike other companies where you have to listen and press about 20 different buttons in order to speak to someone) then within 20 minutes my grandparents were up and running and connected again such a relief when they live so far away.Thank you O2,2
My name is Lucy and I popped into O2 store at frenchgate centre Doncaster to try and transfer all my files from old phone to new one. And had amazing service from a guy Steve. Helped with everything nothing was too much trouble. Also informed me of a better offer with 15% off my current sim only contract that I didn't know about so transferred to that. He sorted everything with my phone was so friendly polite. Very nice person. You have a really good staff member there.I have been with O2 for years and never had a problem with them ever xThanks very SteveLucy,2
"I called O2 in order to receive a PAC code so that I could change networks (no faults with O2, just wanted to try a different one). When I rang the number through my land line, I was answered with an automated reply of 'the number you have called is receiving a large number of calls so service may be slow' followed by 'press 1,2 or 3 for various lines'. I continued to press the numbers to go through to the correct extension, and was prepared for a long wait and awful music. However, the phone started to ring immediately and was answered not even after the first ring. The man who answered was lovely and cheerful, he started going off the usual scripted questions on what he could do to help, followed by my reason for leaving O2. Although he mentioned if I would be interested in a cheaper tariff, he did not keep pushing or try to sell the company any further, and went on to ask me the security questions in order to get the PAC code. Then while he was typing and generating the code, he started chatting to me about his day and asking me about mine while I waited, before giving me the code when he got it. An absolutely lovely man, genuinely concerned and interested in helping me as the customer. The best over the phone service I've had; I'm having second thoughts of leaving O2! It was a wonderful start to the day (I rang in the morning), and although I may have been lucky in the service I received compared to other reviewers, I am left incredibly impressed with O2.",2
"My mother was having problems with her phone and is quite Ill at the moment finds it hard to remember and can get quite confused, she was well looked after in store and given a glass of water. Nicola at Bangor store looked after her excellent. Thanks Nicola, phone is working great and on the best tariff for her thanks to you :). I wish that all shopping places had a Nicola to help!",2
Just renewed my contract after being offered a great deal upgrading (and I always shop around).. I have always found customer services with o2 one of the best. Never used a o2 store so can't comment on that as always been online or via phone but always found they've gone out of way to accommodate any queries or problems etc. Sorry the people in other reviews have had such an awful time and unneeded stress.,2
Just phoned 02 as usuall friendly helpful brilliant,2
o2 customer service help me  with  my phone problems,2
"Ive been an O2 customer now for about 8 years.  Ive stuck with them due to the fact I can get a signal pretty much everywhere plus their UK based customer service has always been very good.I just upgraded and took out another 24m contract with O2, but had major problems with the courier company.  Not O2 fault.  However, O2 got involved, and stepped in to sort out the problem with the courier, keeping me informed all the way.  Their social media team in particular are excellent.After getting the phone I then popped into my local O2 shop to get a case and they did a great deal on one for me. Always been very impressed with this company and their aftersales.  Happy to be a customer of theirs for another 24 months.",2
"Had an issue with the phone I had purchased via a deal through Amazon for the Amazon Fire Phone. Spoke to Amazon who refunded the phone once sent back, and spoke to O2 who were happy to move me over to a brand new phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) free of charge.",2
"Spoke to 3 different people during swapping of my phone, one told me a cheaper deal from a different place, one told me to enjoy my sunday but called it funday, and one said 'I won't go home until i'm sure did has been done for you' Amazing people!",2
"Received a call from Keiran at 19:45 on Tuesday 24th February, was very professional and informative, helped me out massively and has left one very happy customer, being a member of HR for a call centre myself I know the pressure agents are under but can safely say Keiran is one of the best I have dealt with.",2
"I administer mobile accounts for our business and experience all networks on a regular basis, so would recommend O2 every time, as my considerable experience has shown them to be reliable and trustworthy, whilst offering some great little add-ons like TuGo, which has slashed our roaming costs.Vodafone are a big lumbering beast, whose decline in the mobile market is well earned.EE are very well polished and have slick marketing and an aggresive sales force, but after-care is terrible and actually getting customer services to deliver on their promises is like asking a politician for a straight answer.",2
"I've been with O2 for the past 4 years now (having gone back to them after poor experiences with other companies) and they have been faultless in every respect. The level of customer service provided in particular at their call centre has always been nothing short of excellent. I have just attempted to purchase a new mobile/contract through Carphone Warehouse and another network provider due to the fact that they were offering it at a cheaper price than O2. Having had a problem with the online order, I called Carphone Warehouse, and I can honestly say I have never received such appalling customer service. I'm now ordering the new phone with O2, and will happily pay the extra for the phone and monthly contract, knowing that if I need support I can rely on  them to provide it in the same friendly and efficient manner I've come accustomed to. I had a lucky escape with Carphone Warehouse, and won't stray again!",2
Hellobeen with O2 for 7 years live in London area it's a great network always willing to help me and compensate me when they are in the wrong..I've been with all the other mobile networks and they all never ever had this much good customer service O2 the best ....they have great O2 apps as well plus SIM cards are for free unlike other mobile networks they charge u for a replacement so in my eyes 02 are great.....,2
People always complaint but they are much better than most other service providers,2
"I don't have a perfect credit rating but o2 accepted my application without deposit for not 1 but 2 contracts, I have had nothing but a totally reliable quality service and am very happy with them.",2
"I have just changed from EE to O2And the service has been excellent.Alan Gillespie has dealt quickly, competently and effectively with all issues relating to the transfer.The same is true for the rest of the 02 team. A far cry from the incompetent service at EE.",2
"Had no signal for an hour now. This is a disgrace, how can a national network of complicated technology have a small temporary fault like this. Everything should be perfect all the time that's why I pay £10 a month. This missed hour accounts for 0.1% of that 10 pounds; I hope management sees this and I get something free.",2
"o2 are friendly and helpful, i have never had a problem with them or known anyone whom has!",2
"A pain and stress free process of transferring from contract to pay as you go. They refunded me £3 straight away for a mistake that I had made with not switching off mobile data on my phone, occurring £5. I have never really had any problems, only minor which have been sorted out quickly.The website is clear and the online chat is quick and so much easier than speaking on the phone. They have a good selection of phones to choose from.",2
"Good service but sometimes no coverage, no problem with your customer service only the network sucks sometimes.",2
"I have been using O2 for over 7 years now. I have contracts for myself, wife and children with them. The customer service is always spot on. You actually speak to a person not just someone reading a script. The online chat advisors are all very competent and know their stuff. The deals are ok and when I haven't been happy (upgraded to a Nokia once which was s***) they swapped it, cancelled the contract I had taken out no quibble and I just started again with a different phone. Yes you will probably get more minutes on another provider, but I have used Orange and Vodafone in the past. I also worked for Vodafone for 4 years and I know the industry well. O2 are excellent at what they do. Plus their network is built on what used to be BT Cellnet as a result the call quality is excellent. I have a Vodafone as my work phone, in poor signal areas (I live in Devon so we have many of these) My O2 phone still has a reception long after Vodafone loses it's signal. Even on remote parts of Dartmoor!",2
"Finding it extremely frustrating to replace my broken iPhone 5 charger, I contacted O2 to be advised which of their variety of chargers would be the best for me to purchase. I contacted their customer service via live chat due to my busy schedule. I was transferred to the correct department in seconds, and the second adviser provided a replacement charger free of charge. Fast, Convenient and very Satisfied customer!",2
"I apologize for my previous review (negative). It was not O2s fault at all, but mine. First I gave a wrong number of my mobile requesting to unlatch. They wrote to me that number doesn't exist. Then I realized it was wrong indeed. Then I gave them a number, but I again realized few weeks later after reading the 'chat' record, that it was wrong too. Then I supplied the correct mobile number. Then they asked for its IMEI number, which they said can be found by dialing *#06# and I did that with my new phone without realizing that I should have dialed the above numbers using the old phone which I needed unlatching. So again I provided a wrong number. Later on I realized my mistakes and provided the correct details. Within minutes everything was sorted. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. But the customer care persons on their 'chat' were all extremely polite all the time. It was completely my fault right from the beginning. So readers please disregard my previous comment. I apologize unreservedly to O2, and to you readers.",2
"I realise that when writing a review you can only go  by your own experience.  Looking at the O2 score so far it appears to be some way from perfect but I have to say that in terms of the O2 Broadband service I received before changing a couple of months ago, it was excellent.  Rarely did I need to contact their Broadband helpdesk but whenever I did I found them to be very knowledgable and very very helpful.The only reason I moved is that O2 was being taken over by Sky.  I decided to move to Virgin - what a mistake that was!",2
"I took my faulty pay as you go Nexus 4 back to O2 in Milton Keynes on the 1st November, as the bottom half of the screen wasn't registering any touch. They stated it could take up to 2 weeks to be repaired, but typically it's done in 4-5 working days.Queue Tuesday the 5th on November, the phone turned up at my door at 8am, just before I head off to work, working perfectly. Amazing turn around time, will definitely consider buying phones from them in the future.",2
"Any time I have problems, they are available to help on webchat very quickly which saves me calling. I rate them 5 out of 5 for webchat. Thanks, Rach",2
"i do hope I am not testing fate! I have been with Vodaphone (dreadful customer care) and Orange (service became worse and worse as prices went up and up), having had a mobile for 20 years. I actually have 6 numbers on my contract. O2 have astounded me with their service and although I sympathise with those who have had bad experiences, be very careful who you move too. I'm sure if you speak to O2 complaints department (free of charge on your handset) they will be happy to help as they do seem to be concerned with customers and their problems.",2
"I have been with O2 for many years now, and am pleased with the level of service I've had over the period of time I've been with them. They are very helpful and have friendly customer service team! I have had friends who are with Orange and there is a huge customer service difference. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a contract, PAYG or any other service O2 offer to go with them.",2
"I have been on vodafone (absolute scam), 3 (bad customer service in general) & orange which have all been a nightmare. O2 are by far the best provider all round and i have been with them for 2 years, customer service is great, signal is better than most, they dont overcharge you ormess you about, i even signed up to pay an extra £10 a month for an iphone5 just to be on o2 rather than any other network.At the end of the day, with sorting out issues you have to go direct to managers. Everyone working for any provider are going to be the same, it depends whos on the other end of the phone. Although it shouldnt have to be like it, if you get rudeness back from a representative, just hang up & redial and you will eventually find someone who will help you.Just remember, when you are feeling angry & frustrated with the service your given, thats when your more likely to write a review to express your frustration. The best way to find out what network is for you is to ask family and friends for their recommendations.",2
"I have been with O2 for over 2 years now, and have been very impressed with the following:1. The Great Mobile Phone Coverage2. The Fantastic Tariff3. The super fast 3G Speed and coverage.4. The Out of this world Customer Service.5. The amazing Free mobile phoneI could go on about just how great 02 are, however I believe the above five points pretty much clarifies why I rate 02 at one of the best mobile phone providers in the UK, that I have had the pleasure to use.I cant wait for my next mobile phone upgrade and tariff review, as I am more than confident it will add even more value for money.Well done O2.",2
"I've never, ever had any trouble whatsoever with O2, was a pay and go customer for four years and the only reason I ever left the network was because the signal coverage for where I had moved to was poor. Something which O2 told me they'd look into when I told them I was leaving, no pressure from the salesmen on the phone who simply wished me luck and thanked me for my custom. I can always understand what the customer service representatives are saying and they are always helpful! Apart from my current location I have also never had any trouble with their coverage, signal strength and internet alike.",2
"My wife and I have only been with O2 for 3 months, but so far everything is perfect! Good signal, good deal on the new iPhone 5 and now we have decided to use their broadband service (Instead of Virgin Media's terrible broadband). O2 seems competent, friendly and has very friendly staff. Whenever I deal with them I go to their store on 286 Chiswick High Street. It is a bit out of my way, but the staff there is fantastic and they deserve 90% of the credit for making us stick with O2!",2
I am alwaye 02 customer this is best network & customer service in uk. I think the service is outstanding.,2
i love o2. best network and best service provider in the uk,2
"Even though we pay a bit more than other home broadband users, we've had really good service and connectivity. I'd recommend O2 anyday.",2
"I've been with O2 for 8 years and use them for my phone and internet.  I think the service is outstanding.  It is rare to find a large company that still genuinely cares about its customers.  On the rare occasion I have an issue, it is resolved immediately in a very considerate way (most of the time its my mistake).Bills always correct, signal is great, prices are reasonable to low but most of all their customer service is exactly what it says it is, a 'service for customers', something many companies have lost sight of.Please keep up the good work O2.  I think you are brilliant and actually enjoy calling your customer services.Thanks!!",2
I was experiencing problems with my original carrier and as unhelpful as they were O2 are extermely helpful and I have had no problems with their service.,2
"U get great signal all over and calls are really cheap, plus they give u goodies when u top up and I can talk to other o2 customer's for free x",2
"o2 is the best, but giffgaff uses them so cant complain with them too, best service, usually best deals, best customer service",2
"I am an O2 mobile and Broadband customer and have been using them for many years having been unsatisfied with Vodafone before.  They have great customer service and prices are decent.  Broadband wise, very quick speeds and easy to set up.",2
"Took my phone to the shop in cleveleys to buy a new charger, the girl that served me told me it was their responsibility to repair it as still under guarantee, which I hadn't realised, I was served within a few minutes, I was given a loan phone while mine was being repaired, within a few days I received my phone back, was kept informed at all times by text and phone call, I cannot praise them enough for their attention to detail, and the girl that served me was excellent. Thank you so much 02.Valerie jones.",2
"I've been with O2 for years now (at least 6) and I can't say that I have ever had a problem. I've always paid a reasonable amount, got a reasonable phone, had great reception (I know this depends on where you live) and whenever I've ever called them they have been quick to answer and very good at answering my question without passing me around some call centre.Ok, I do have one gripe - There contacts seem to be getting longer and longer. I'm sure at some point they'll give me a contract for life, but all the others do to so I can't moan too much.Overall (in my opinion) the best UK mobile phone company.",2
Somehow everything about them gives me a good vibe. I will always use O2. A happy customer!,2
"Whilst the signal strength in my area isn't great, I still achieve download and upload speeds well in excess of others in the area.3MB/s and 300KB/s where others can be as low as 300KB/s and 30KB/s or even less on a bad day!Their customer helpline has always been able to fix any problems quickly and courteously.",2
"I hear people find 02 customer service hard to get hold off, I've been with them for over 10 years now and have had no problems with them.",2
As a family we have three broadband sites and five mobiles and could not be happier. Whats more they have a uk help desk brilliant you can understand what they say well nearly it is based in Scotlaand. just joking.,2
"been with O2 for seven years, when contact O2 they have been very polite to resolve any queries we ever had and o2 priority moments have been extremely rewarding! I love them and no doubts that thy know how to keep customers happy! wanna free cuppa every week join O2!",2
"GREAT SERVICE, been with them for years and never any problems",2
"I have been with O2 for a number of years and have never found fault with the company. I have in fact persuaded my entire family and many many friends to switch to O2. Although I have been asked by other companies to use their services, I will never change.",2
great company,2
Recently bought an O2 simcard on ebay that was a number I wanted but as I am with Tmob (dont get me started on them!) I had to transfer the new number. I contacted O2 customer service and the lady I spoke with was absolutely delightful!My son is an O2 customer and is always on to me to change to them...how I wish I had before taking out a new contract with Tmob.,2
Very good phone network,2
"No - they may not always be the cheapest provider on the market, but their service is worth the little extra you pay in my opinion. No bad experience to date over several years of using them.",2
I have been with o2 since owning a mobile phone (many years). I have had no problems and will no doubt be with them for many years to come.,2
I will be sticking with o2 now and won't be changing provider again after my last mistake.Signal coverage is really good,2
Very good service would not go anywhere else,2
"All very handy and clear, fast and timely manner!",2
have been with this network for donkey years now. I am just too loyal to this company and have recommended it to people in past as much as i would continue to recommend it to others.,2
obviously im going to be a little bit biased about o2 as im an o2 customer but they are still one of the better network providers,2
A breath of fresh air after dealing with Orange..and I can get a signal now,2
"We've used o2 since it started, and having seen the experiences of competitors, we would not change.  The products are exactly right for us, as are the prices.",2
"Always been with O2, love the free O2 to O2 calls and online account management",2
Haven't used that often but enjoyed when I used it. Very easy to find stuff and use services.,2
"I have been an o2 customer for 15 years, and I have never had any complaints, their billis system is clear, their network is one of the best... my phone has signal 99.5 % or the time...",2
Have been with them for years without any problems. Staff a pleasure to deal with,2
"Have my contract with O2 not the cheapest but coverage is good and would not be without my iphone now, just waiting to upgrade at the end of my contract, christmas here we come !",2
I've used O2 mobile for years so that speaks for itself as I'm a person who looks for a bargain but without losing any quality. As soon as I heard  O2 were doing home phone and broadband I switched and am highly satisfied with the service. I advise all my family and friends to change to O2 as well.,2
"I love O2 and I love the 02 arena, it's my second home!",2
Good value and first class support and assistance,2
Not bad but can be better.  Top up web can be confusing.,2
Not the strongest signal but good contract.We are like an old married couple after all these years.,2
O2 is doing great,2
O2 is best,2
Great site so imformative and easy to use,2
"Never had any problems in all the time i have been with them, first rate company. *****",2
Best network coverage... Best deals.... Best prices... what else do we want?!,2
I HAVE BEEN WITH A FEW MOBILE NETWORKS BUT THE BEST ONE FOR ME IS O2. ALL MY FAMILY ARE ON O2 SO I GET FREE CALLS TO THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER MOST TO ME IN LIFE. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH 02 AND I SHALL STAY WITH THEM.,2
been with o2 for most of my 'mobile life'. great reception and great offers. best for contract deals.,2
good all round service,2
"Use here in the Uk, I travel the world and I have never had any problems with connection, even in the remote parts of Africa, my trusted friend.",2
once I thought Vodafone is the Best.But now I know the best.O2 is the Best.No Doubts,2
good company wouldn't use any other network,2
Never had a problem,2
have been using for 15 years or more now and i love the service website is so easy to use and check everything u need to u can even swap and change anything u want to with out having to spend hours on the phone. im the only one outta all my mates on 02 and im the only one who has signal every where i go. will continue to use this service for another 15+ i love it :),2
"They are offering good broadband service and have excellent uptime. Prices are affordable, recommended.",2
I have been with O2 since te days of btcellnet and I would have to have an extremely good reason to look elsewhere.,2
"I have a Pay as you Go account. I use my mobile about twice a year. I do not have to top up unless I have used up my time. O2 have never pressured me to change my useage. I use their service sparingly, it has always worked first time, and they leave me alone to get on with it. I could not wish for more.Update on 26 09 2014 ... two and a half years later.The service is still reliable and the rules are still the same. In concrete terms, when I've bought does not disappear on the basis of arbitrary time limit. I still pay only for what I use.",2
Not the best with techno. And help is always on hand.  Give them a bell and they sort me out.,2
"I've been with o2 for i dont know how long. Haven't ever had any probs with them whatsoever.The staff in their shops are so very helpfull, polite & never try and push you to take the dearest contract or pay as you go phone.You tell them what you want and they sort you out, end of.Brill, Brill, Brill!!!",2
never without a network and some good offers,2
Would always recommend o2.,2
"Helpful staff, set up phone, helped me decide on best mobile for me",2
excellent customer service,2
Love 02 as that is who I am with & I would never go with any one els.,2
"Always connected and really good value. Im pay as you go but with monthly contract, the main thing is there have been no hidden surprises. Ill stay with O2 as long as they dont change too much.",2
ANY PROBLEMS ARE SORTED OUT WITH THE MINIMAL OF FUSS. GREAT RECEPTION,2
Not too many offers of free texts I never use!,2
excellent coverage in north east. fair price bands,2
looks after its customers,2
"O2 have served me very nicely, they answer my questions and are always polite and friendly, as is their Live Chat.The reception is great on my mobile, their Broadband is reliable and hard to beat.",2
best phone company that i know,2
I have been a happy customer with O2 for 7 years......they have a package to suit every pocket,2
"Had pay as you go and contract phones with O2 and never any problems. Even when I decided to switch to Vodafone, but switched back again cos no signal at home!I have 2 contracts running at present and the local O2 shop staff are excellent! Even ended up getting a cheaper tariff with a different phone than one I originally went in to see about!It's all about customer focus!! Or that is what it feels like and I should know being into quality management!",2
"i have now been an O2 customer for a number of years and once again was surpassed by their customer service and support when my renewal was due, they listened, looked around and once again offered me exactly what i needed at a price i wanted to pay instead of trying to sell me what i didnt need  -  well done O2",2
"I had o2 years ago, then switched to 3 then switched back about a year ago. Signal reliability has been far better and their call centre doesn't seem to be based far overseas like at 3's. Good range of phones in store at a good price. No complaints",2
like the range and deals of o2,2
I have been an o2 customer for over three years and always they have been very supportive with help and information. As my needs have changed they have proved very flexible and always try to find the best deal for me. Their network coverage is good and I always have confidence in them. I am a great believer in companies that provide good value and good service and o2 tick all the boxes!,2
easy to contact all call's to them in the Ukweb site fast and simple,2
"The price for broadband for being an O2 mobile customer is amazing. I'm a heavy user of the broadband, using lots of bandwidth with no complaints from them. Speed stays consistent, never have any problem streaming Full HD movies on the XBox.Never experienced any billing problems and customer services are always helpful and friendly.",2
"All my family use a O2 mobile chip and I`ve tried another mobiles network but for me the best one till today is O2 Network, better mobile internet and calls from anywhere, just the best in my opinion.",2
Good prices & service but when calling customer service I get different answers each time I speak to a different operator.,2
Have used O2 via my Tesco phone for some years now.  Reliable service and good signal in most places.  Very satisfied.,2
cannot fault them in any way,2
very pleased with the service never had a problem in 7 years thanks o2,2
Ive been with O2 for several years & have never had any kind of problem. Recently got a iPhone & Blackberry from O2 so was transferring numbers/sim's and they done it all for me! Honest customer service & best of all UK Call centers unlike other networks! People have had problems with O2's delivery courier YODEL and YODEL have the worst reviews for delivering but Ive never had any kind of problem with them delivering my 2 phones. 5/5 FOR O2!,2
"I have been with O2 as a mobile phone service provider for well over a decade!  I have switched between different tariffs and services with ease, taking best advantage of what is available at the time.  The service is so good that you can have it and forget about it!  Billing is clear and easy and the signal is superb!  The deals are pretty good too.",2
I ordered a new phone at 5pm and it was delivered by 12 the next day. Couldn't ask for better service than that,2
After 10 years with another company O2 have proved to be an excellent alternative. I was offered as fancy or as basic as appropriate and am very pleased so far after 2 months,2
I've been with O2 since 2005 and have never had any problems with them. The network is great and never fails. All of my family are with O2 and connecting is so easy. I also like the number of tariffs available. Excellent!,2
"Pretty much 100% uptime on their broadband and never seems to drop in bandwidth. Might be contention ratios but it's a very good service and the help line, whenever i have needed it, has friendly and competent employees (with no hard to understand accents....thankgod!)",2
"I purchased a HTC mobile Phone on Contract and i have always been pleased with the help given to me regarding the initial purchase and the customer care help team are second too none, they are knowledgeable on there products,helpful and polite at all times.I would not use any other provider.",2
Been with O2 for years and as you would expect it's not been a trouble-free period of time. But they step up to the plate and resolve issues perfectly in my opinion.,2
Just to say thank you for your amazing telephone customer service :),2
Excellent coverage tariffs and after sales service,2
"I switched to O2 just over a year ago having been (unfortunately) an Orange customer fo years. The difference in customer service simply amazed me, on my first bill they overcharged me by not removing a bolt on, the customer service immediately corrected it, apologised and put a credit on my account as a goodwill gesture. I have never had a billing problem since, and the customer services provided and cost are excellent. I will definitely stick with o2 for the forseeable future!",2
"I use simplicity and have done for about four years now, love that 02 to 02 if free - i also pay £10 per month extra for international calls - i get three numbers and can ring family members with nothing else to pay other than the £10 - brill - i also get a spanish number included in this so my family can ring me (its diverted straight to my mobile) and only pay local ratesIf you have family abroad I would highly recommend this service",2
"My work phone is on Vodafone and my personal phone is O2. My personal phone is always in signal and never drops out of range. I always struggle with Vodafone to get a signal, even when I am in London.",2
Been with O2 for the past 5 years and they havent let me down. Great service/reception and customer care. I recommend O2.,2
I have a monthly account and a pay as you go one they are both very good value for money,2
I have never had any issues regarding the O2 network. I have managed to constantly get signal wherever I go for phonecalls/texts and mobile internet.,2
"They're just great. Excellent customer service, good tariffs and nice little touches like the rewards. I'll probably never switch to anyone else.",2
"I have been an O2 customer for over 13 years and have always been satisfied with their service, contracts and deals. In a world of sharks that are the other telecommunications companies O2 is second to none.",2
"but o2 must give prepaying customers treats too, quite pricey if you dont get the right deal.",2
"I bought my first iphone, however I did the whole thing on the web, maybe I could have got a better deal over the phone as I have been with O2 over 2 years.........However I cannot fault the service and the web site to monitor my account is very good compared to their competition. Delivery of phone was very fast. I am thinking of moving my home broadband to O2 soon, also may move my wifes contract to O2.",2
This is the best signal in most areas in paignton tried the other networks but this is by far the best,2
always working real good,2
"I have been with o2 mobile for over 2 years now, so they were able to offer me by far the most reasonably priced broadband package.In the first week I had issues with the speed so I called there customer services and what a pleasant surprise!! UK based call centres every time, and so helpful, the agents were able to guide me through the settings and resolve my speed issues, I now have super-fast, super-cheap broadband! Thanks",2
"I joined BT Genie a worrying number of years ago and when it became part of 02 so did I. Since then I have had many years of good service and helpful support from this company and I have just signed up for another contract with which I had a good price on an iphone 4s.  Their website and on-line service are great and their customer service and sales team are informed and helpful. Best of all they haven't dodged billions in tax.  I would recommend 02 to anyone because of all the horror stories I have heard from friends using other phone companies - you don't get that with 02.  I have had 15 years of honest, reliable, good quality service and that must surely be almost unheard of in this sector.",2
"After having the misfortune of go over to 3. I am please to be back with O2. Their customer service Team is top Notch and welcomed me back, they did not try and sell me something that I did not want and they listened to me, I love the fact that I spoke to a local person,",2
"THIS SITE IS A WINNER ,O2 SITE IS SO EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR . 100% WINNER WITH ME .JASON",2
"I have been with most (or all) of the major mobile service providers.  O2 have a way of making me feel special, by proactively informing me of benefits I may be interested in.Example:  I received a call as an iPhone4 user in advance of the iPhone4S release to see if I wanted one on the release date.  Very considerate.  And it was a local  UK call centre and they knew a lot about my usage.Good work O2!  Now about those excessive;ly high roaming charges...",2
Ive had a contract with o2 now for about 18 months. Can fault them at all. Great copmpany,2
"very helpful, good value been with them for over 14 years mever had a problem",2
I have been with o2 now for a good few years and I have never had a problem with them. The customer advisor Ash in the Kettering store in Northamtponshire is always helpful and nothing is ever to much trouble for him. Keep up the good work o2.,2
"I have been an 02 customer for 12 years. I have always enjoyed the best customer service, some great deals and total efficiency when occasionally things have gone wrong. I just love 02!",2
"Been with vodafone and tescos, o2 are always very very helpful and responsive",2
"Excellent choice of tariffs, they could use updating though as some other porviders have even better deals for new customers however, O2 will not be beaten on deals for loyal customers! Been with them 4years not a single problem!",2
"I find my experience with O2 just amazing. They  have the best prices and the best customer service ever. I had a problem with the landline and they refunded me the difference for the phone calls i couldn't make. My bandwidth was low once and an engineer spent hours with me on the phone trying to understand where the problem was and finally he found it!! I've been a customer for years and called them many times, they are always helpful and always very kind in every single phone call i made. A rarity in these days.",2
Been with various phone companies but O2 is one of the best ive been with deals are very good and its very cheap. Would recommend.,2
Have been with the company on contract for 13 years (in various forms) and have never had a problem,2
"been using 02 for 10years now, wouldnt use another service, I hope they continue to be the best, they have affordable packages for everyone, I have continual service whereever I go, 02 for life.",2
"Always great service, no problems with bills and upgrades are always delivered on time. I have been using them for about 16 years (Was BT/Cellnet before)",2
"Recently left Sky for O2 with regards phone and broadband, the service up to now has been first class. I am already a customer of O2 with mobile contract of many years",2
JUST MOVED TO 02 FROM ORANGE MUCH BETTER SIGNAL,2
No matter where I am o2 does deliver.,2
"I am an 02 pay as you go customer and have been for years. It's great because if you top up £15 a month you get unlimited calls and text to other 02 customers and everyone I know is on 02, plus you still get to keep you £15 credit. Also every 3 months 02 give 10% of your top up back which is another bonus. Great network to be with.",2
"Treated like an adault. And not a fool, good company, good deals, and offers that are all usefull. Unlike other company's with gimicky rubish.",2
better than the rest... at least for me....,2
"Great service, Great communications No hassels",2
i love 02 because if you dont top up for a bit you will get sone money free..,2
Always have used this service. Good for your money.,2
always good service from this company. still want to get my hands on a new iphone 4 s though!,2
Never had 1 single issue.I am an o2 gold customer and love that I get upgrades early,2
Superb service always in signal and helpful customer care,2
"Great coverage, excellent handset choice, competitive costs and ~ Priority Tickets!I was so impressed as a private individual that I switched my company business to O2.",2
love Zyaem.com,2
No problem been with O2 for yrs,2
best deals no matter what always got some new scheme or deal,2
Have been with O2 for over 10 years have had loads of other companies try to take make me swap.  Not interested i have alway found the customer service to be second to none. So I will be staying put,2
"I've been a customer of o2 for quite some time, and I must say I'm impressed.To start with, I find that they have a nice reliable network. I can usually get a good signal about 90% of the time. The 10% is probably out of town, in rural areas. As for 3G, this has improved a lot in my area, which is due to more masts being installed by them. Again, 3G coverage is very patchy in rural areas.I've never had a call dropped, and have I probably only missed about 1% of any messages that I've been expecting.I guess their mobile data lets them down a little, but to be honest, I don't use it that much so I can't really rate them down for it. It would be better if it was cheaper, and had more of an allowance, but it seems to work reasonably well for me when I do ocassionally connect.Support has been great too. Whenever I've needed to contact them, It's always been a quick, and pleasant experience. They seem to know what they are doing, and get it done for you.What I love the most is the loyalty to their existing customers, along with the rewards for their new customers. They are always coming up with new and exciting schemes to reward it's members, all of which benefit me. If I left their network, I'd miss those.",2
"I have been with o2 for many years (after a brief and silly fling with another network, but we don't talk about that period).Recently I decided that I wanted to purchase a blackberry, but on Pay As You Go.I have found that o2's blackberry sim is absolutly fantastic. I top up my £15 pounds a month and then I get Blackberry Services, 500Mb AND 500 texts, all COMPLETELY FREE!!!!Then, when I had a problem setting it up, I went on to their website, and a friendly guy popped up and started chatting to me about how to fix the issues! It was quick, easy, and I didn't have to spend forever on hold whilst paying a fortune on my phone call.O2, I will NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN, and I'm still really sorry about that incident where I did for 2 months. It was a mistake. Forgive me?",2
"I am and have been an O2 customer for the last 8 years.I have Mobile Contracts, Home Phone & Broadband subscriptions with them and have yet to be disappointed.The Broadband is as advertised (my area doesn't get great speeds - but they accurately informed me of the speeds I would get - thus managing my expectations) and their Home Phone service is great value for money.Their mobile contracts are similarly good - and in many cases beat their competitors hands down.They offer a £5 per month discount on their Home Phone & Broadband contracts for O2 Mobile customers and always ensure that existing customers are offered the same great deals and new ones - whether that be 1/2 price broadband for six months or exclusive mobile contracts.A very, very happy customer! I hope O2 continue to put such an emphasis on great customer service and value for money.",2
"I'm very happy with O2. When my house was burgled, they were extremely helpful, and within 48 hours, I had a brand new phone, same number, minimum disruption. I rely a lot on my smartphone for business, so I was very happy. Since then, the service has been great, and the signal is very strong wherever I go, luckily.",2
"I wouldnt go with any other network,o2 is the best for everything, they are second to none and i would recomend them to everyone.Happy customerXx Cat xX",2
I have been with O2 for many years and find the company trustworthy fair and customer friendly,2
Very helpful company with 24/7/365 free to call UK Customer Service.Brilliant for Broadband also.  Have never had a problem with signal reception.,2
I am on Orange wife is on O2 she is happy I am very unhappy .....says it all,2
"on the ball every time with good service nothings to much trouble , i even phoned up on a sat phone to get more credit and they where very quick to deal with me when i told them how much it was costing",2
I stupidly went to orange last year after over ten years with o2. After a nightmare time with orange and their customer service (that should be lack of it) feel like i'm back home,2
"I have been with 02 for years,since they were BT CELLNET and i would never go with anyone else.Their website is first class and they are constantly updating & trying to improve it by asking their customers what they think.You can actually see the feedback they receive being implemented into the upgrades,its very good.TOP MARKS FOR 02,I WOULD NEVER CHANGE SERVICE PROVIDER.",2
This is a must for people with smart phones especially iphone users. I bought my iphone from apple and ordered an O2 Simplicty tarrif. The sim came within 2 days and was activated straight away. This is by far a superior service to any other mobile provider. Highly Recommnded,2
"Good service, good prices",2
My phone is from tesco and they share the network with o2. It's great as i get a signal everywhere and my mates who are on orange don't!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
have used them for the last 2 years and have been very happy.  My latest HTC is great,2
just what i needed,2
"Four years I have tormented O2 with my Phone contracts, each time I manage to confuse them, do they care? You bet they do they always get me back straight and the customer service is brilliant, as is their O2 Phoneshops.",2
Good response and backup from customer care,2
"Got next day delivery on my upgrade.  I always recieve a friendly, fast and efficient service.  I have been with O2 for 5 years and I wouldn't use another company.",2
...avoid the on-line gurus that take an age to respond to your questions. I actually thought it may have been a computer program as their responses were so slow. I asked to speak to their supervisor and that wasn't much better!However I have been with )2 for over 10 years and this is the only complaint I have!Still 5 stars for me!!,2
I have been with o2 for years and have nothing but good feelings towards them!i have recently had to deal with the customer service dept ( a few probs i have had with my broadband and home line) They were very helpful and sorted my problems out straight away!.I would definiately reccomend them to anyone.Especially the broadband and home phone line package (you get a £5 off each month if you have a mobile with them!),2
"i have been with 02 for years, its never let me down and they are always very helpful and polite if i have ever needed to call them. i`ve never had a problem with 02 in the past and i love the 02 surprises you get when you topup i look forward to many more happy years with them.",2
best phone company by far,2
"I have been with O2 for around 5 years now, their service is second to none, and their service team is always so helpful",2
Love o2.I top up £15 a month and get free calls and texts to other o2 users  which is great as loads of people I know are on o2.So you still have your £15 to call landlines and othe networks.,2
deffo would use this network,2
"I've been with o2 for years, it's very rare that I can't get a signal on my phone. In fact, I was once 3000ft up the Schiehallion mountain in highland Scotland, and my phone rang... the reception was as clear as a bell.I've had their broadband for 2 years, and it stopped working once. I switched the router off then on again, and away it went.I'm constsntly listening to people at work moaning about their providers, I'm glad I stuck with O2.",2
No problems great reception. Very helpful staff,2
"I am on the O2 Simplicity 300 tarif and they have never let me down. I also get unlimited data for £7/month and have never had a problem with this.The support staff are good, and have reduced the ammount i have to pay a couple of times whilst still getting the same deal on minuites and texts.I also get free O2 to O2 calls, so me and my girlfriend are very happy :-)",2
"Im on a plan that I get unlimited texts and 100 mins on a rolling monthly contract of £10but give them a ring if you are on pay as you or contract go and just talk to some one there to sort out some bolt-ons or change the contract to what you actually want this is the best way to get a good deal.good way to get the best out of ur contract is to say that another company is offering 'xxx mins and unlimited texts  for the same price as im paying now for half as many minuets and 300 texts'. use other companies deals to your advantage they will normally match them.They may offer ;Extra texts ,mins or internet1 min = 1 textmaybe extra texts or internet for loyalycheaper tariffsThey have room to negotiate just be nice :D",2
"Been an O2 customer for many many years and never been let down once. If there was a problem, it was easy to fix. Great customer support in both online and offline.",2
Always so helpful and sort out the problems straight away.,2
"As a customer for over 10 years, I must say that O2 are certainly consistent in their good customer relations.  Their deals are among the best out there too.",2
I have been with 02 for a number of years now and have never had a problem with them ever. I love the customer service as they are so helpful and always try to make sure your query is dealt with and that you as the customer is happy.I have not just a contract mobile phone with them but also their home broadband and home telephone and I can say I have never had any problems with any of them. The fact that they seem to get good network coverage is a huge bonus and the prices are excellent for the broadband and home phone line a little bit pricey for contract tariffs but with the network coverage and customer service I can't complain.Keep it up 02 an excellent job.,2
"o2 stands out from the crowd, as one of the first company to start getting things right. I have my mobile, land line & broadband with them.I am not a heavy user, so I don't make lots of calls or text messages. But I get screwed on hand set prices when ever I upgrade.",2
"i have been an o2 customer for almost 3 years now and they keep surprising me positively over and over. being nothing more than a humble pay and go customer, i am well happy with the amounts of great offers and tarifs being thrown at me almost constantly. none of the other prividers takes such good care of those who are not yet willing to go for a contract offer. and i really love the top up surprises!",2
Great for using in UK and even abroad. Has been with me many years. Love it. :),2
"Excellent service, good deals, great signal (most of the time) what more can you ask for?",2
Thank you O2 for helping with my new mobile phone purchase.Your help was greatly appreciated.,2
"I have been with O2 for years and have never experienced any problems with the provider. I would rate their customer services as good. On one occassion I had a problem with a smartphone I had purchased from somewhere else, O2 were still happy to help and did their best to resolve the issue. Although I never swear allegiance to them (I always look for the best deal even if it means switching providers, I'm with Orange at the moment!), they are better than some of the providers out there.",2
"I find in the southeast o2 is the only network that works in all areas, with no nosense. Better than any of my friends and their phones.",2
"Have been with 02 for 4 years, great reception in most areas.",2
I have used O2 Home BB for 2-3 years now and find their serice to be impeccable. Really excellent service and well recommended.,2
O2's services is superb I recently upgraded my wife and son to Blackberrys the transition could not have been better. Thank you O2.,2
I travell all over the world and have never had a problem with this network. Have been with them for years.,2
"Always have been with o2 and find their customer service, rewards and incentives great. Love that advisors make sure your pay and go tarrifs suit the customer not their income. Will always recommend them to friends and family and customers that I deal with on a day to day basis as a sales advisor. Good job to the company and the staff, rare thing to come by these days.",2
"02 the network that always has a good signal, and if you do get a problem their customer service is second to none",2
"Been with them for 8 years and have never had a problem with them. Upgrades good, customer service brilliant. Polite and professional.",2
fast and service is really good,2
"what's not to like, you get a free email account & 200 free webtexts a month, it's really good value for money",2
I've been a O2 customer for over 8 years now and I've never had a problem. Would recommend to anyone.,2
great funky company that does the sale thing but with decorum!,2
"The most generous mobile network with all sorts of extras for free - Treats, Surprises, Rewards.  You also get all sorts of allowances as well as retaining your top-up credit and can choose from a  huge range of Bolt-Ons.  I've been with O2 for about 8 years and will never change!",2
Ive been on o2 for as long as i can remember and it has just got better and better providing me with personalised rewards and chances to win things.,2
Been with them for years.We use Orange and Vodafone at work and sometimes struggle with reception.I never do with O2.,2
NO PROBLEMS VERY HELPFUL,2
Never had a problem with that company!!!,2
"My first ever mobile phone was on O2 and I'm still with them now £$%& years later!  With the rewards system, the bolt on options and the generally excellent signal coverage I've never felt the need to go anywhere else.  Not often you can say that in this day and age, but I am and always have been happy with my mobile phone provider.",2
"Been using O2 for business mobile for 5 years. Excellent coverage, easy to use website, reasonable prices, good service and nice upgrade options.",2
Excellent customer service! I swear by O2.,2
"smashing network, love the rewards wouldnt swop for any other network well satisfied.",2
"always look to find the best deal to suit your needs, never oversold a product",2

I have been on O2 for 5 years and I have always found them to give excellent service.,2
i have  got o2 since i came here in the UK.My cousins got other networks and when i compare prices and network coverage its good man,2
Love o2 always have and will never change my network,2
"Simple... I like loyalty and reward it in life. So, when my phone went on the blink last year and I was two months from the end of my contract (usually spending £200 a month!) I hoped T-mobile would do the usual and offer an early upgrade. Amazingly, they took a hard line and sad a flat NO! Even though I have held my account with them since it was one2one in 1996!So, once my contract, my mobile broadband, my personal mobile phone, my wifes phone and car phone were up for renewal I moved the lot to O2. Better customer service, cheaper, better signal at work and home and I have been offered early upgrades - for being a LOYAL customer. Well done O2!",2
Initially I went through Carphone Warehouse & never had substantial connection issues & the price plan was reasonable.  They also supplied my a very reliable handset.  I have been very pleased.  I have just recently changed my contract/price plan to match my current employment.  I am dealing with O2 direct & so far I have found them very easy & convenient to deal with.  I have been a customer for about 4 yrs.,2
GENERALLY GOOD SERVICE,2
I have been with O2 for quite a while now. My wife also has a phone with them. We have had excellent service and will continue to use them for the foreseeable future. Their tariffs are fair and the optional bolt-ons are a brilliant idea.,2
All the family are on contract with 02.  There customer service is excellent and they are always very helpful and efficient.,2
The best network by a mile was with 3 mobile never ever go with them maybe cheap but you will never get a signal.,2
I get great signal and text messages allowing me to book tickets early at events happening at the o2. Need i say more?,2
"I had my phone stolen recently and as soon as it was reported to O2 they acted right away, and couriered a replacement handset to me the very next morning. By comparison with my normal contents insurance - it took me weeks to sort out a replacement laptop.",2
never any problems but if there was they soon sort it,2
had no problems with this sevice provider whatsoever.,2
"I never get any problems with O2. Always manage to get a signal, no delays sending messages, no problems with billing.Always get excellent service with polite and knowledgeable staff at call centre.",2
excellent network give you lots of free things back unlike any other network,2
"Good value package, great coverage,",2
I am at the moment enjoying my 4th year with O2 iphone contract as well as 2 year ISP contract.  great job O2 keep it up.,2
I have three phones all with o2....all three smartphones of different types. One purchased over the counter..and two online.Online account with the ability to 'join' all of the accounts and manage the phones is excellent and easy to use.Real level of expertise in the shop (Worcester).Never had any problems with connection or the phones supplied.I've upgraded two of the phones online at the end of contracts with no problems at all and fast delivery on the new handsets.No hesitation in recommending.,2
Never had any problems first class service,2
"I've tried Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile and left them all due to poor service, both customer and phone reception. I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, I have my mobile, landline and broadband with them. Their customer service is second to none, they don't charge an extortionate amount for contacting them either should you need to (which in my case is rarely). I cannot recommend O2 highly enough and no I don't work for them, just one incredibly satisfied customer.....rare in this day and age I know.",2
i've been with o2 for over 10 years and never had any problems customer service is always 10/10,2
Good service they offer and great customer service too,2
Good reception n very good customer service.May be the price is slightly higher then other networks but standard is too good.,2
I'd recommend anyday,2
"Always great signal wherever I go, no point having a mobile if yr running around trying to get connected",2
after a terrible year with the three network in ireland i changed back to o2 got a free phone and double top ups for a year great customer support far better than 3's miserable attempt from some call center india where i couldnt understand anyone and got no where,2
We use O2 for our mobiles and home broadband. We have contacted their customer service via phone for both mobile and broadband queries and each time they have answered our questions succinctly and clearly. They have been friendly and polite. Similarly when we visit their stores the service provided has been great. We usually visit the store at Fulham Broadway. All the staff are friendly and helpful and we leave satisfied. Sometimes the process of changing plans can take a little while however it does not worry us as the staff are friendly and have a chat with us so the time goes really quickly. We are seated and offered a glass of water so we are made to feel comfortable. It is not like our experiences with some other organisations where you can't wait to leave the store. Thanks O2.,2
"have myself, my husband, and my daughter on o2 network!",2
excellent customer support,2
Always with the best coverage and good deals,2

"Who else gives you free incoming calls abroad? when you spend as much time in Europe as I do, its a no brainer being with 02",2

"They were very helpfull when I wanted to reduce my contract, As due to an accident I no longer used my phone for work any more and was paying £35 a month. And was not useing the minutes I now pay £10 per month which is much better",2
Been with O2 since they started and have always had good service from them and their network.,2
"No hassle straight friendly service which deserves loyalty. I am treated as a person, not a customer. After serveral new phones, contract renewals and general enquiries, each time I have left the O2 shop (Ipswich) feeling happy with the service I have received. Well done, keep it up.",2
ive been with 02 some years and always found thier customer care second to none and also have great service and they constantly looking for ways to keep ur tariff to suit u and save u money.,2

They offer a fast and reliable Broadband service which there competitors have failed to provide ton me.",2
This is the only company i have been with and i am happy to stay with them as I have no complaints with the service they give.,2

A special mention for their Customer Service team.....Any time I had problems, customer services would walk me through it, not in a hurry to get off the phone like other companies!!! It felt like they WANTED to help me and sort me out.Also very good prices!!",2
i have been with o2 for many years now and have never had a problem once,2
"Since being a member of O2 3 years ago, i have never had an issue with their service. This being mobile network service and also the customer service teams. They are always super friendly and more than willing to help. It actually reminds me of the Apple customer service which is renowned as being excellant.Another great thing i have to take my hat off to O2 for is when the iPhone 4 was launched. I waited in the massive que to get my much anticipated iphone 4. They made sure i got one without a hitch. To add to the excitement they were handing out free cakes and newspapers to people queuing which i thought was a great touch.Happy to be an O2 customer and reccomend to anyone.",2

Proffesional company with their customers always in mind.,2
Always found O2 to have a network and coverage better than the competitors. Would not use any other now,2
"Fantastic.  I have been with them since I owned my first Mobile phone, would not change.",2
"I've been with O2 for about 5 years now, having previously been with Orange and Vodafone. I find O2 offer great customer service (on the few times I've had to call)I use the PAYG sim in an iphone, so for £15pm I get unlitimed text, unlimited internet and a good few minutes. I also get the 'Surprises' which are not amazing but certainly add a bit of fun to things.No plans to change anytime in the near future",2
"i have had a few pay as you go mobiles from o2 and have had brilliant service and coverage each time. i have also had a pay as you go mobile from orange and a contract from three, niether of those were any good compared to o2. tesco mobile is good but then it uses o2 so it would be. i have now got a contract with o2 and i have had no problems at all ive always got a signal, the phone is a samsung wave but is cheap as i have free minutes and texts and 500mb of free downloads. there customer service is the best ive ever dealt with too!",2
from start to finish about six days.very pleased with this company,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years... they have always given me a great service. Very helpful advice in relation to my bill, contract and upgrades. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",2
"I've been a customer and user of O2 for nearly a decade now and wouldn't ever think of changing to another company. Really can't fault them. Why people even bother to go to their competitors is beyond me - especially with O2's advantage over Orange in that they aren't founded on Evil, or the malice and corruption of Vodaphone and T Mobile.Plus, since they took over the old Cellnet transmitters it means that O2 have consistently the best coverage of anyone.",2
"Have been with o2 for almost 7 years and never had any bother with service, Any queries and or questions dealt with quickly and professionally. Easy to use web site with easy to read and simple to follow instructions.",2
"I've been with 02 for many years and have switched providers on many occasions if i've bought a new phone with a different providers sim card. I find that 02 have the best tariffs for me, i text and use the internet a lot but don't really make calls, i had the 500 texts and 500mb of net for £15 a month but that wasn't enough texts for me so i changed to unlimited texts to 02 as everyone i know is on 02 and when i top up £15 i get the benefit of free calls to 02 although i don't use them, i have bought a bolt on so i get 500mb of net a month for £7.50 so for my £15 a month i get internet and unlimited texts.I love how on 02s website they have the option to live chat with an advisor, that way you don't need to make expensive phone calls or wait days on a reply to an email that might not answer your question fully.I have one complaint and that was i ordered a mobile phone and it never came on the allocated day, i got in touch and i was lied to, i asked to cancel when it never arrived and i was told there was no way i could cancel even though i have full rights to cancel. It finally came 1 month after ordering, was peeved off that they lied to me on more than one occasion about the delivery instead of being straight forward.",2
"Great deals, particularly for pay as you go customers.Hardly any network problems. Friendly staff.",2
i have always been on o2 until recently and seriously regret coming off because out off all the networks o2 defiantly has the great coverage the only problem is it is the most pricey of them all.,2
"ive tried most networks but o2 is by far the best good network great freebies , also very helpfull customer service",2
"With O2 i have never had a problem i ordered my pay monthly phone ages ago, i prefer contract savnig having to keep a eye on your credit all the time, and i never get sneaky bills added on, you get great offers from o2 like o2 arena stuff, i rare lose signal compare to orange and voda who mates of mine lose it quite alot. Be a customer of them for 5 years now, cant go wrong really :D",2
"helpful, thoughful and considerate anwers to elphone inquiries",2
i can recommend this company to friends.,2
"Having transferred from another company I find O2 to be a better company throughout. They were speedy with delivery, accurate with the bills and are very friendly to deal with.",2
"O2 represents, in my eye, the best value for money, coverage, customer service and perks/rewards of any of the big network providers. I have had some very bad experiences with other providers and I am pleased to say that ,as a current customer of both O2 mobile and broadband, I have not a single complaint to make about the superior service",2
The customer service at O2 Stroud was brilliant.  Thanks to Donna for her efficient and friendly manner. Would recommend her and O2 Stroud to anyone,2
"Easy to deal with, never a problem with connection and loads of different offers and SURPRISES.",2
"I've been with O2 god knows how many years, it's the best for service and in my opinion always has been, my friends are always moaning about Orange or T mobile (now one of the same), as for any others its the same story.They just do not compare to O2.",2
always had great service from o2,2
"I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 3 recently and spoke to the Business team (I'm a business customer).The service person i spoke to was very helpful, explained all the tariffs and helped me decide which would be most suitable for my needs.I ordered the iPhone 4 16GB and it was with me the next day, followed by a new sim card and letters explaining the contracts, tariffs etc.Really easy to talk to and they explained everything.Will definitely be upgrading with O2 again",2
Haven't encountered any problems with O2 and I've been with them for many years now.,2
Fantastic customer service.  Ordered a new phone at 3pm and arrived the next morning at 9am.,2
"Had o2 18 month contract, no problems but did find insurance expensive & waste of time to be honest. (£7.50 pm for samsung Tocco Ultra) When phone did break I was told although it was 17 months old it would be covered for repair so didn't have to go through insurance. Other than that, always had good signal & no other complaints",2
After 4 different mobiles and three insurance claims which were dealt with within twenty four hours I can think of nothing but praise for O2.,2
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING,2
"i used 02 for years, find them brilliant",2
"all ways top service,",2

the offers that 02 prvide are amazing.,2
any contact with o2 has always resulted in satisfaction. The staff are always helpful and friendly.,2
Iv'e been with o2 for a number of years now and I have always found them extremely pleasant and courteous to deal with.,2
o2 is the beast.,2

Staff in shop and online always there to help,2
Been with the company for over 10 years now and I havent had a single problem with O2. Whenever I have had a problem with my phone or tariff they have sorted it out straight away and even compensated me,2
.../////////////,2
Sometimes takes a little while to get what you want but generally the service is good,2
this is the best mobile network provider which has reception almost everywhere in northern ireland fantastic,2
I have been with o2 for 8 years and have always had excellent service for my  money.  I get a strong signal almost everywhere in the country and especially in Derbyshire my home county.  I use their broadband and home phone service as well as mobile.  I have used several others for broadband and o2 give the fastest uninterrupted service.  I would recommend an o2 contract to anyone.,2
Simply excellent Service. & good support when there are problems,2
"I changed from T-Mobile to O2 because of the poor reception I received from T-Mobile living on the coast, this despite their assurances coverage would be good. To add insult to injury, providing a poor service still cost me hundreds of pounds to get out of my contract. It's about time the law was changed to protect the customer and not the phone company. O2, no problems with coverage and service.",2
"Out of all mobile suppliers, O2 signal is the best",2
"Never had any problems getting a reception whereever I am excellent service and good pricing, Love it",2
I have used O2 for a few years and find them very good to deal with and do what they say they are going to do.  No problems so far!,2
"I use PAYG and am delighted with the service and network coverage. My wife has a contract with O2 and we recently renewed. The staff in the O2 shop in Livingston, Scotland were well trained and super helpful.",2

I have used O2 for a about 10 years now and have always received excellent service and will continue to use them for the forseeable future.,2
"I always get someone decent on the end of the phone when I call 02; knowledgable, helpful and courteous. More than you can say about most phone operators these days.",2
WhenI have had problems with the network they have been sorted out promptly.,2
"consistantly good reception in all areas ,the best of all the providers.",2
Been with 02 since 1989 when it was known as cellnet. Never had a problem with the service.,2
"great communication, my bills never have any unexpected charges !! all in all great service !!",2
Always get good signal everywhere and if I have had problems with my phone they have always been delt with promptly. Recently sent Phone to be repaired was back within 1 week. People at O2 who I've spoken to over the phone have always been helpful.,2
I've got a couple of accounts with O2 but with Blackberry handsets.Offered the best deals I could find and service has been first rate.  Dealt with their customer services a few time when looking to upgrade handsets/review accounts and service was first rate.,2
enough said above.,2
"always have signal, look after existing customers, brill bonus's and extras plus you get priority tickets for gigs!",2
"Best all round network, no hassle good coverage at a whole",2
very helpful customer service,2
Was treated as a valued customer not a money making opportunity.,2
"I have been an O2 customer for many years and have always found the service and coverage the best.  With the Smart phones I have experienced some problems but these have always been resolved with one phone call, including 24 hour replacement on two occasions.  When talking to Tech Support they have always striven to solve the problem straight away after showing patience and understanding.  Could not ask for anything more.  Support within O2 shops have been first rate also.",2
i have had work phones on other networks that have lost signal and i check my personnal phone only to find i have signal and had had to use my phone to contact my employer. Will never change from o2 its the best,2
"Find O2 has a good signal in general. Have only had to rarely access support services, but always very helpful",2
"never had a problem with either, highly recommended.",2
"been with O2 for many years now, always been satisfied with service, and offers",2
MOBILE ARRIVED BY PREMIUM CARRIER VERY QUICK LOADS OF TARRIFS TO CHOOSE FROM AND LOTS OF EXTRA TREATS LOVE THE TEXTS FROM O2 MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL I CAN GET  A CONTRACT  TARRIF ON PAY AS YOU GO WOULD LOVE THIS WITH REPEAT PAYMENT ON CARD BUT NOT CONTRACT,2
I am a novice on mobile phones and needed help and 02 were extremely helpful sorting out and directing me to where I needed to go on their site. Thank you. V. Wells,2
ive had all network over the years and o2 seem to be the best in this area for me,2

"I have been with O2 for many years now, the coverage is exceptional, works wherever I am in the country, they always find the best deal for me, simply have no complaints!",2
"I have been with 02 for years and cannot get a better deal anywhere else.  Any problems I have had have been dealt with by customer services in a professional manner and I have a few products with them.  They most certainly reward loyalty and I love the whole service, package etc I have with them.",2
"have been on o2 since 2003 and would not change for the world, best deals for me, perfect phones and the customer service from o2 is brillient and helpfull.",2
Excellent Service,2
"I have moved my mobile phone and mobile internet to 02 as they are a better company in my opinion. I have tried other networks and i am fed up of them phoning me up at home and on my mobile, they just wont leave me alone. 02 has let me choose what i want to do, what i want to pay, and if i want any help they are there for me on line or in the shops.So thank you 02 for keeping me sane.",2
They have online help guides as well as people online to talk to you about your problems. Have had nothing but good experiences with O2,2
"I have been a customer of o2 for about 6 years and in that time have had no issues with getting service or trying to sort out any questions / problems I have had. Their call centres have always been easy to get through to, and the people at the other end always seem to be helpful.I had a problem with a phone I took when I upgraded back in february, the people in the store were quick to swap the faulty phone, and made sure the new unit was working properly for me.The only thing I would think to mention is that in some cases it is difficult to find the information you need on their website, but as I don't need to access it regularly its not something that I find to be too much of a problem.Overall my experience of o2 has been great, and I would recommend the network to anyone looking for a new provider.",2
Great offers and service.,2
I haven't had a problem with them. I like the fact that I can manage my account and email them rather than having to call a call center. They usually phone me back when I email too!,2
"Excellent customer services, plans and even better reception",2
GOOD RECEPTION ON MY IPHONE4,2

I just love this network.  So easy to use and excellent customer services.,2
"I have been with several different networks in the past but I have found O2 to be the best. Signal coverage is fantastic, great deals, and some great ""perks"" as a customer including access to priority tickets for sports events, gigs, and comedy shows. I recently took out a new contract for an iPhone 4 with O2 and the customer service I received whilst purchasing my phone in store was fantastic it was quick, reliable and very helpful.I can definitely say I won't be changing to any other network after being a customer with O2.",2
I've had an O2 Mobile for a number of years now and until recently I have had a 100% service.I have now switched to t-mobile but if I dont get the service I desire then Im switching back.,2
"I've been with O2 for a couple of years now, and always been happy with the mobile phone side of the business.  When renewing my contract recently, not only did I get a great tariff with the Blackberry that I wanted, but they also offered me a home phone and internet package that was a third of the price of my BT package - and with far superior customer service!",2
never have a problem and when i do they are always there and willin to help :),2

Genuinely helpful and honest customer service. Clear billing and control over my account,2
Been a customer for years great all round service,2

"Good customer service, calls answered promptly. I live in a rural area and the provide the best reception in my area.",2
i only use o2,2
"great free stuff on pay as you go, i get free calls and texts to other o2 numbers as long as i top up £10 & surprises gifts to play to",2
"My work phone was on O2 and personal phone on Orange.  In comparison the reception on Orange is awful, lots of dead spots.",2
its all just so easy talking to staff and the free gifts i have no problems with this service,2
i find O2 to have excellent customer service which is important to me as a consumer.  i have never had any problems trying to connect or not being able to get  signal from wherever i am. their pay as you go plans are easy to follow and value for money but their simplicity card is excellent value. i would definately recomend them,2
"i have had a contract with o2 for nearly 3 years. i get great signal anywhere i go, including spots that may other phone networks struggle with.if i have ever had a problem the customer services have always been friendly, helpull, and easy to get hold off on the free call numberthe arent the cheapest network out there but i think for the service they give the couple extra pounds is definately worth it",2
I would highly recommend,2
"I have been a customer of  o2 since July 2009 and have found them to be, helpful, informative (especially online help and e-mail feedback) and in general good value for money. Service wise I have only recently had one problem with my 3G availability with my iphone4  and it was dealt with promptly and efficiently.  I was also offered a £5 credit to my account for the loss of service. To be honest this was far better than my previous suppliers!",2
"They offer simply the best deals for my needs and will also grant you freebies and suprises when you top up, depending on the amount you top-up.not a bad word towards o2 they are awesome! :)note: (been with vodafone, orange, 3 and o2. and o2 is by far the best as i have been with them for 6 years now)",2
Never had any complaints and would reccomend to anyone,2
Cust service is top,2

o2 always does what it says it will. I've never had any problems and would like to think I'll have a pay monthly contract with the company for the foreseeable future.,2
"excellent service from o2.. never had an issue with them, best for serivice and deals..",2
"02 are the best Mobile Network I have ever dealt with, I never had to contact them in the 5 years I was with them & only moved company because I got a better deal.Moving to Vodafone was a big mistake, they are pretty useless, never answer the phone, & rude & always seem to magically over charge me every month.I'll be going back to 02 once my contract is renewed. I'm sorry 02!",2
after contracted to the company for years I still happy with the service,2
I can't really comment too much on o2's customer service because I have never had a problem with the service I receive from the company!! The coverage is great.,2
"IVE BEEN WITH O2 FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS NOW. I WOULDNT LEAVE THEM FOR ANYTHING. DEFINATELY THE BEST NETWORK AROUND... FREE TEXTS, FREE CALLS, SUPRISES... WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR...O2 IS GOD",2
"I've been using o2 for about 10 years on and off, i changed networks in between to try but always came back to O2, good customer services, good offers, good reception.",2

"Great tech service, no hassle, good customer service staff, very helpful",2

beenn with 02 for 12yrs or so and never had a single problem i am getting an iphone4 this week lets hope i have no problems changing to a micro sim meny thanks 02,2
"Friendly and effective customer service makes all the difference when you hit problems or need help.  You really notice it when you move to an operator like 3 who seem to practise customer abuse from their offshore call centre - never again, I'm back with O2 and much the happier for it.  Simplicity contracts are great value too, and network coverage is good. What's not to like?",2
Excellent staff. Good customer service,2
"With O2 i havenever had a call cut off unexpectedly and have never been out of range, I will continue to use them as there service is second to none.",2
Great signal in my area and the broadband service is £10 p/m for unlimited upto 20MB broadband.,2
I like em for their good value service,2
"I have tried the other networks and O2 just delivers the business.  Always answer the phone quickly when I have a query, my local store are always very helpful.  I even took broadband from them!",2
"Alwasy had a great experience, from problems to rewards, thank you.",2
Best mobile phone company around,2

"O2 , Thank you for providing my mobile service perfectly .O2 , Thank you for providing my faultless Broadband !O2 , Thank you for proving unrivalled customer services !Keep up the good work",2
"I get unlimited texts and internet on pay as you go every time i top up with £10, these last a month and then i just use my £10 credit- couldn't ask for anything better. It's AMAZING!",2
Two friends have changed to O2 for service and coverage. Transfer made easy and package perfect.,2
Always been very helpful and good value for money.,2
Excellent signal coverage !Superb 3g services !,2
Customer service = GoodValue for money = goodTech support = goodWhat more can you ask!!,2
I do find network coverage is much the same for all mobile operators (except 3 which was v unreliable) but the O2 telephone and online support is first rate. I recently transferred my home and mobile broadband to O2 as well and that was a pain-free experience with great service too.,2
"The best customer service I have experienced for years, you get to speak to a human being located in UK that actually is polite and knows what they are talking about. Very helpful...would never go anywhere else.",2
"Excellent customer service, excellent all over!!!",2
o2 for me are the best mobile company as ive never really been with another apart from orange but i changed from orange to o2 a while back because of the deals they done for example if i was to top up £15 pound a month i would get free text message untill the end of the month also to other o2 callers its cheaper. You also get to put in a code with certain amounts of money you top up the better prizes you would be able to win.,2
"i have 2 contracts and an 02 money card with 02..i have found them to be the best coverage in my area, have the best phones and are always helpful when i need them to bei am seriously considering changing my broadband from BT to 02 also because i like them so much and im kinda loyal like that",2
"I have been with 02 now for 6 years and have never ever hadaq problem with reception, i have a pay as you go phone and they give you rewards for topping up for as little as £10 a month also rewards every 3 months for topping up at all great customer sevice and i will never change.",2
I have always been on O2 for all my life. That says it all really.,2
"Fantastic Customer Service, helpful and polite which is really rare these days, couldnt be more accomodating, i was thinking of leaving as they are not the cheapest but to be honest, i have had no problems so why spoil a good relationship",2
O2 Are simply THE BEST! - Great offers and at low prices!,2
i have now been on o2 for about 4 years and cannot fault them if i have ever had a problem there customer services was always polite helpful and straight to the point there network coverage is second to none and there tariffs are the best out there in my opinion why anyone would select a different service provider is beyond me as o2 provides quality care competative prices and exellent network coverage10/10,2
I have been with most of the other mobile phone service providers and have never had this level of service. When you talk to anyone from o2 on the phone be it a change of priceplan to just general information they are always pleasent and willing to help in anyway.,2
"no complaints at all, bill never excessive and have never had any problems with connections.",2
Fantastic service from O2 staff in quickly locating an iPhone 4 for me. Excellent follow up by the sales person and excellent service from the update service as to availability and locality. O2 are the best for customer service bar none.,2
I recently upgraded to iPhone 4 with O2 and it was the easiest thing I have done. I Love the phone and cannot wait to see the great service O2 will provide me :-),2
I have been with O2 for many a year & have heard some very bad reviews about there customer service. I have just recently upgraded my handset & could not have been treated better. The CS rep was very understanding & knowledgable about the options I had & within 24hrs my new handset was with me.,2
the best going.,2
"Whenever i've had a problem i've phoned o2 and it's been sorted out straight away, they are very friendly and helpful. I've been with o2 for about 4 years and wouldn't use any other network.",2
"Have been with this company since my first mobile (back in the days when they were almost as big as bricks) never had any problems either dealing with customer service or with reception on phones, all this and still on pay as you go.",2
"Staff are trained to a very high standard and understand your needs fully, neevr had an issue and always exceeds my expectations time after time, would not hesitate to recomend across all boards, internet, shops, online and via their call centres! 100%",2
"I am very pleased with this network. They allowed me an early upgrade to the new iPhone 4 and gave me an amazing deal along with it.If I ever need to contact them there is always a polite, happy, helpful employee on the other end of the phone willing to help with any problem.Also their network coverage is excellent, I am able to get signal just about anywhere. I always recommend 02 to all of my friends.",2
very helpful all the time! good prices to,2
better than 3.,2
I am with O2 for last 3 years. I get great reception in any corner of the house where rest of the mobiles give up. Keep up the coverage O2 and get some competitive pricing.,2
"They just cancelled my (unnecessary) phone insurance, at 4pm on a Sunday, within 15 minutes! And refunded me the rest of the month's cost.I've been with them for years for their great service and reception, and they just get cheaper and cheaper",2
Over the years I have left O2 to try other networks (why leave if it's so good? like most people - you think it's a better deal) I always ended up going back to O2 before my contract had even finished.O2 online does some good deals. Recently I moved from Simplicity to a regular 18 month contract and as I was impatient I went into the store to get the phone. O2 then noticed I was normally an O2 online customer and automatically put me back from offline to online.I appreciated that as you get more for your money that way.Only thing I query is why the deals in store can't be the same! But as it doesn't really effect me I won't knock them down!Will never leave O2 for another network ever again - I've learnt that lesson!,2
