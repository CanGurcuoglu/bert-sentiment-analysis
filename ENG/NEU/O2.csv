Been with 02 since 2012.Signal was great same with 5g roll out  very rarely have zero signal. Data tracking is very easy on the o2 app. Overall as a company not bad unless you need to speak to customer service. Long time loyalty not rewarded. A friend who's been with 3 5 years gets deals for loyalty a friend on Vodafone gets great loyalty deals for renewing too.  O2 have pushed prices up and up and with annual contract price rises over their new 4 year contracts the showed for black Friday deals was far more than the 36 month currently Overall factoring total price of phone etc. It's almost like o2 currently are actively trying to get customers to leave. Prices are more than other providers and longer. 12 months to go then will be free of 02. The customer service team in the last 18 months have been appalling at best. Contacted them to pay off a contract when was made redundant and got told I don't owe anything again affirmed why and what I wanted to do to be told same again. Was unsuccessful. Sure that's borderline illegal to refuse to allow someone to pay off a contract in full when they have been made redundant and want to pay full balance.,1
"The O2 hosted Ginuwine and Tyrese yesterday, and they were absolutely incredible. They truly owned the stage with their energy and fresh presence. Their performances were polished, and their voices sounded just as amazing as they did in the ’90s—professional, nostalgic, and unforgettable.SWV also delivered a great set, and their talent shone through. That said, a small note to the O2: £15 for chicken and chips was a bit steep for the portion size!Tyrese is still as handsome as ever, and Ginuwine remains the epitome of charm and sexiness. Thank you for such an amazing performance. Honestly, they should’ve headlined the show—it was packed, and the crowd clearly loved them.However, it’s clear that so many people came to see Jodeci. If Ginuwine and Tyrese had performed alongside Jodeci, it would’ve been an unforgettable comeback event. Jodeci, please bring your talent back to England—we’re all waiting for you! KC and JoJo, we’re ready to celebrate, drinks in hand, before the show. Make it happen!",1
"Overall good service getting my new phone, network etc. Though the netwrok and connection is much better than Three so I'm not mad.I did nearly get scammed and hacked with a couple of weeks of moving to them, so very scary.And the case that I bought with it (iPhone 16 Pro Iceland Ultra D3O MagSafe Kick Phone Case) which has a ring/stand that just fell off in my hands after having it for about a month and a bit scared me. When I tried to complain about it I was told it wasn't covered and there wan't anything they could do. Don't buy that phone case and good luck!",1
"I recently had an issue with a new phone I had ordered. I don’t believe it was o2 responsible delivery issues, more so DPD. That being said the customer care wasn’t the best. It was hard to communicate the issue and I had to rehash it every time I called.That was until I spoke to an advisor call Kamarl. He was fantastic I would give him  5*, he spoke sense, followed up and was incredibly helpful. Unfortunately not all the call handlers were as helpful as him.",1
You need to sort out your inflation.I'm having to leave and rejoin just so I can get a better deal.Other networks fix their rate no increases.After 3 years you eventually end up paying 20% more than market rates for being a loyal customer.,1
I was wished a wishmas magic by text. Are you a bunch of witches druids and warlocks now 02?  Sort it out it's Christ's mass Jesus Christ.  Happy Christmas on the birth of Jesus our saviour. 🙏🏼,1
Plz again try to improve internet it bad try to maybe use vodafone network but tbh I love virgin,1
Instead of giving away free data to people why not reduce our contributions when all said and done your not giving anything your paying customers are.,1
"Advisors at 02 are very helpful, its only their tools with servicing calls and taking payments which let them down here.With text message, a receipt to confirm or summarize  the event which has happened through service may aid the customer with better experience.Also IVR needs to give customer time to select an option. Its a constant shambles for company that has good care with their customers.In waiting room, advise, caller what their position is and to offer a call-back.Also use emails to summarize call handling.GDPR Regulations followed with everyone.",1
"Ordering online is a nightmare from start to finish doing a Switch Up online.  Set the contact number on my order to the wrong number, and set the order up wrong with DPD, no one can help me get the PIN I need for delivery.  Not sure what I'm meant to do as I only get 14 days to return my old phone. No one will help on live chat or Phone keep blaming DPD when it is a known problem documented regularly on the 02 forum.However buying different item from in store the experience was totally different they couldn’t have been anymore helpful and kind.Don’t buy online go to a shop.",1
New customer here.So I ordered online the phone and airtime I wanted.Samsung s24 meh it'll do.Told delivery in 5 days. 5 days later still without a phone and no update.I ended up having a 1 hour phone call to see if I can get a different phone nope.I cancelled my entire order instead. No email stating out of stock. Could of saved me a lot of time.Operators tried to charge me £20 despite having £7 a month airtime on the previous order.Nope not happy.Giving 3 stars as the last person I spoke too was really nice.,1
I usually don't have any problems but I was a little concerned when I realised I couldn't activate my call waiting. I called O2 and they said prepaid customers don't get call waiting. Since when?! I'm pretty disappointed about this as call waiting shouldn't be an upgraded service and available to all. I will be looking to a new provider. There are some good deal out there at the moment,1
"over 2 weeks for customer service to get back to me .want an upgrade to a new phone , and want to stay with 02 , but 02 want £54 pound , another company can give me the phone i want with an 02 contract for £43 plus a £150 cash back .02 will not match , they are the same company .So thank you o2 for wanting to overcharge existing customers .i do have to say Laura at 02 customer service , wow great service , thank you , so now 3 stars instead of one , but if they helped in the first place we wouldnt of had to write a review",1
"I am, as I start to write, hanging on to the 02 customer service, having spent hours going around in circles through the menus on their website trying to cancel a Disney+ add-on that I've never been able to access and am now being charged for.However, eventually Rohit restored my faith by sorting the cancellation and giving me a better phone deal.I give 1 star to the frustrating website but 5 stars to Rohit.",1
"I was switched from Virgin Media to 02 some years ago on a monthly plan paid by Direct Debit. My experience has been fine but, today, out of the blue, I took a call from 02. The man apparently wanted to know if I had any complaints. My only complaint was that I did not want such uninvited calls at inconvenient moments. I did not understand why he was calling so I looked at Trustpilot. I am shocked at all the recent complaints. I have had no reason to call 02 but these complaints do make me concerned about the company and the difficulty sorting out an issue were it to arise.",1
"Calling 202 for assistance is pretty awful. Long waiting times that normally result in you just being cut off and having to start again. At one point I had been on the phone to an agent for 10 mins and was actually making progress, just to be hung up on unexpectedly with no call back. I later learned that Carlo the agent had not actioned anything we were discussing.The online chat service is considerably better, wait times are not as long as calling and the agents seem more willing and able to help. Thanks Rupali!",1
"The wait to be answered was over 16 minutes and the whole time I was waiting I was assaulted with hideous music, that actually hurt! Their were very high pitched notes that drilled into my brain, alongside loud static, which caused me to wince.Before the horrendous noise I had to explain myself multiple times to the automated system which kept interrupting me.Once I got through, the operator was helpful and able to help me with half of my problem. The other half will have to wait for my call back tomorrow by a different team. At least there won't be any so called music!",1
"It's been ok.When I was transferred to O2 from my previous mobile phone provider both the O2 website and app were down, this was really annoying.The high number of messages and emails about my billing is annoying, also the app keeps asking me for an additional pin whenever I open it.On the plus side, the network has proved fairly reliable and fast, and the price is good.",1
"My contract with O2 has just come to an end. They have been my provider for many years, even decades. My monthly payment has just increased approximately £2.00 to about £13.00 a month for 4GB of data so I will be moving provider very soon. If I renew my contract with O2 it is a minimum of 24 months for the same deal except you get an extra 2GB a month for approximately £11.00 per month. So an understanding why customers change providers.",1
"Thanks to the O2 customer service team and special thanks to Mr. Shadley who has resolved my device Samsung A 52 S . It was suddenly an unknown cause of a dark screen problem, and he gave the solution with an alternative backup, I had an old iPhone 6 plus. He has connected the O2 services to it. I have been trying to contact last two days, approximately 7 hours of trying, I became very upset with the O2 customer service team, however Once Mr Shadley gave person-centered care cordially and resolved the issues, I appreciated his help. My name is Mohammad Shahjahan My O2 contact is 07941366457. I was really impressed by his help.",1
"I can't say I am completely unhappy about this company, as going to Europe without having to worry about data is a good plus. Network coverage isn't bad too. However:1-Once you sign a 12 or 18 contract with them, be prepared to pay more for what they offer to new customers if you compare the rates2-They constantly increase the rates, more than other companies3-Customer service average chat: after the bot shuts your chat in your face several times ""because we are very busy"", if you manage to talk to someone be prepared for 20 minutes of security questions, agents handling maybe 20 cases at the same time, ignoring the request,  and giving you random answers - totally useless",1
"i responded to their ""amazing unrepeatable once in a lifetime"" offer. It includes a tradin, and u get £100 off on deal, but when you ACTUALLY push the buttons it's £14.40 on the telly, I did it twice before giving up and chatting to the helpful lady in South Ifrica who alleged that it's £100 from 02 added to my account, and £14 from the recycling shower. But they can't actually show that anywhere on their webshite. Nowhere do you get a screen showing the Whole Deal, BEFORE you actually place the order.But all software is same - written by spotty kids in dark rooms, never tested on real people in the real world.",1
To cut this saga short my number was 'transferred' from my previous mobile airtime supplier.only not all of the relevant files were transferred to O2.After my number was 'transferred' I found that I could only ring out to anyone but initially no one could call me.Eventually we established that only a person using an O2 sim could call me but  no one else.No one at O2 was able to help resolve the problem.I have updated this review as I received a call from O2 explaining what had happened.My old number is now working with my new telephone company.,1
"I have been with O2 for over 15 years. Never had a major issue.However, this network unfortunately took a very sentimental thing from me. In Dec 2021 my Grandad died and had left me a voicemail a few days prior. I know I did not delete this. Even though the message was SAVED, I have never been able to retrieve it - it was deleted. They have since changed their VM service to need a confirmation to cancel VMs. I had also noticed various other of my personal VMs deleted around the same time. I know this is subjective to me, but that VM is something I will never be able to get back. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",1
"I have been an O2 customer (through affiliates such as Carphone Warehouse or direct) since June 2004. There were two good things about this network provider, for my personal experiences: Customer Service and Signal Quality. Even though the CS hasn’t waned for me yet, the Signal Quality has been shocking compared to their recent speeds. In 2014, I first got 4G in my area @ 68Mbps. Now it’s 2023 and I’m averaging around 4Mbps if I’m lucky. Naturally, the jargon spewed will be about number of users in the area but that’s nonsense as the city centre has speeds of around 160Mbps for 4G. In a pandemic and post-pandemic era, this is absolutely below par for modern mobile network expectations and delivery. Please sort it out.",1
"Been with O2 for over 15 years, had good and bad, only grip is signal coverage, it’s rubbish drop out quite often and Data going from a rare 5G to 4G that just about works",1
I've been with o2 for many years and never had a single problem.On the other hand I've ordered a phone this morning for same day click and collect and still haven't got a single email that the collection is available.Might seem like a small gripe but you shouldn't have that on the website if the same day collection is not processed by the end of the day.If I didn't mind waiting I would've ordered the next day delivery.,1
"Tried to call O2 to expedite PAC code processing for number transfer to new O2 SIM to unlock Virgin Media + 02 Volt benefits. First few attempts to call 202 just failed or disconnected following a number of rings. Eventually got into a queue with a warning of 45 minute wait. Spent a long time listening to super low bitrate hold music.When I eventually spoke to someone, they confirmed the schedule for number migration + were able to associate my Virgin Media account with my O2 account to secure Volt benefits (double minutes + US roaming).",1
"OK, but not great. Query about changing pin code for sim card resulted in ‘please go to o2 shop’. Quite difficult (language problems) to have a meaningful conversation with o2 agent.",1
Service is normally decent but the overall performance of the network has declined so badly over the years. They do allow 25GB of roaming in EU so that helps. Prices aren’t as competitive as they used to be.,1
I joined o2 in June 2022 on a 12 month contract. In April 2023 the price of my contracted increased 17.25% from £8 to £9.38. A whopping £16.56 per annum.I called customer retentions on Fri 9th Jun and had to wait in a queue for about 14 mins.The analyst took my details but didn't sound enthusiastic about his job. The analyst placed me on hold for to look for a deal. After 12 minutes they hung up.I called back with similar wait times. The analyst initially only offered uncompetitive rates at a higher cost. I said I wanted the rate given to new customers. On directing him to the moneysavingexpert website he agreed to match the 30GB SIM for £8.Now upgraded my review from 1 to 3 stars.,1
After a stressful change with 02 from EEOver 10 calls to customer service and a visit to Wilmslow store Kersty Jones managed to sort out my husbands phone.  In my opinion this girl needs a pay rise or get her to train all your staff.  Thank you Kersty for helping us ♥️,1
I am waiting on them to fix something. Not too bad in general where I live but they are telling me a mast broken meaning I do not receive/ cannot make calls is not their problem. This may well become a 1 star review if they do not pull their socks up,1
"Wish I had read the reviews before starting a contract. Was very happy with GiffGaff for 10 years but they don’t offer Apple Watch mobile service so I switched. A disaster from the start, they set me up with two separate numbers for some reason and two months later still am unable to activate my watch after more than a dozen calls. The customer support is disheartening — they know next to nothing about the issue, tried to get me off the phone by saying they will call back and if they do, they hang up right away. Worst company I have ever encountered.EDIT: After several more attempts I was eventually contacted by Robert who gave a solution — I needed to update my phone number in iPhone settings (it won’t happen automatically with a SIM only plan) and do a SIM swap to try again. It worked. He also offered to follow up. The issue is a lack of knowledge across call centres but I eventually did get the help I needed and am updating my score to reflect that.",1
"Mixed experience where one customer advisor was either inexperienced or trying to dishonourable keep me in contract despite explaining as on refresh wanted to cancel the monthly rolling contract for one of my numbers with phoned returned in period. He said I can.choose to believe him or not but I knew he was wrong so ended call and rang back to get a really helpful adviser who came across as helpful, knowledgeable and listening to what I was wanting. I put it down to questionable training and development if two advisors could be poles apart. Just wish at end of call it asked you to rate your experience on keypad as one would get 0 out of 5 and the next 5 out of 5.",1
"Spoke to a wonderful women Laneez. She was extremely poilet, going above and beyond to help with my issue!! I’ve had an ongoing data issue which is why I’m rating low, however my experience with Laneez was great, she was very helpful and reassuring. Completely taking ownership of the problem.",1
Good deal when moving to O2 from Vodafone but signal cuts out quiet abit & very often sounds like we’re talking under water.I’ll see how it goes for the remainder of the contract,1
Disappointing data speeds (4G or 5G) and sometimes really poor signals when compared to my VF or EE numbers. I'm only keeping this contract as O2's roaming offer outside EU is better than the others and the offers in Priority app are usually decent.,1
"Good intentions and really friendly staff, but it just takes an absolute age to do anything.2 x 40 minute phone calls to change a small detail regarding my direct debit.Should be faster",1
Hannah from payments team was super helpful and went through a lot of solutions for my issue with me. 5 stars for Hannah but 1 star for o2 the money hungry company that actively makes it difficult to open complaints on purpose,1
"I have been moved over from Virgin to O2 on a sim only contract. Great coverage and a good price too but I am fed up of the constant messages from O2 about my usage, bills due to be paid, bills paid, DD requested etc. I get more messages from them than my best friend.",1
"I have mine and my husband's contacts on O2 with them getting £85 a month from us. I've always paid early and sometimes overpaid.I'm trying to cancel my husband's contract that has ended. He has a new phone and new network as there is no incentive to stay with O2 - less perks, most perks located in London, and it was more expensive to upgrade with O2 after being a loyal customer for many years than get a new contact elsewhere.I can't request a PAC code through SMS, I can't request one through My O2 account and I can't cancel the contract through My O2 either. I was waiting to talk to a chat agent for over 30 mins to then having to wait another 15 mins after my first message to then be sent to wait for another chat agent for no apparent reason. They told me to go through My O2 account then disconnected. I've heard about all the people being on hold for hours after calling 202, so I have no clue how I'm supposed to cancel our contracts!Edit - I can say there is at least one decent person at O2. My last resort was to send a message through Facebook and I was finally able to get my issue sorted. All the stars just for them!",1
"Appeared to have been overcharged, a lost mobile being replaced in an O2 shop and probably incorrectly set up by staff in the shop, to access an unneeded ""wifi"" signal ?.  O2 proved difficult to contact, both online & by mobile, but on contact, the operator was very helpful, arranging a probable refund and polite throughout.  Line was exceptionally poor, I presume due to the location I'd had to take the phone call in.  Apologies to operator for any annoyance on my part",1
"I have had good service and been a long time with O2 for years, even the few years I was with Giff gaff (also O2 network). I like the priority offers although I don't use them as much as I used to. Since they have had a mast down near Chester, the coverage has become atrocious. I'm not able to have proper voice calls in my flat. I have had to resort to my landline which thankfully I still have but costs me to use.",1
"O2 is just okay-ish. I have been with them, SIM Only customer, for 2 years but I decided to port away to another network after getting tired of not being able to properly use mobile data when I'm out and about.It's okay for general web-browsing but anything more data-heavy in most locations and it will struggle a lot compared to the other networks. 5G on O2 is often slower than 4G, or even 3G, elsewhere.Coverage is its strength and is on par with the leader EE and in some places will beat it. The service options available, like VoLTE, VoWifi, eSim, etc. are quite similar to the competition but the implementation can sometimes seem a bit shaky.O2 Priority is probably the best reward system alongside Vodafone Very Me but it's hardly a thing I can't live without.Offers good value for money, if comparison or cashback sites are used, and it's the only main network that has EU roaming included on all plans and with a generous 25GB limit. The Volt benefits, double data and free roaming in extra locations is a nice extra.My experience with Customer Service has been sporadic but has been between okay and good, apart from one time when I couldn't correctly contact them for a whole weekend about a billing issue.If you are looking for a network for calls, texts and basic data it can be a good choice. If you need something more on the data-side then look elsewhere.",1
"I had a highly disappointing experience with O2 as my network provider. They consistently overcharged me, billing me more than my selected tariff, even after I canceled my O2 account and informed them about it. Their customer service was abysmal, with excruciatingly long wait times on the phone. Overall, I found their billing system and customer service to be a nightmare. My experience with O2 left me thoroughly frustrated and disappointed.",1
After trying for 2 days I eventually got a real person to talk to and managed to sort my contract. Absolutely impossible to do on the app as kept saying my password was incorrect which it wasn't.,1
"I bought a Samsung Z Fold 5 on 7 Aug 2023 through O2 and they had an offer to buy ear buds worth £219 for £1. I have contacted 02 customer service to claim this offer and was told I should receive a code after 30days from date of purchase. I was told to contact them after 5th September if code had not been  received. I called on 6th September and was told a form had been completed and was to expect the code within 48hours.I still didn't get the code and after a few days I called again. This time I was referred to Samsung but Samsung advised that this was an O2 offer and the code was meant to come from O2. I called 02 again and was promised that the code would be send.Today it's 10th October, I still haven't heard from O2.",1
"I`m on pay and go. They used to be good but now, their coverage is shockingly bad. Hardly any signal, and poor mobile data connection and speed",1
"No problem with service, however at end of my contract when I'd paid for my phone they thought they could still charge me for it. They are now my ex provider",1
The stars are for Ashley at O2 in Solihull who finally sorted our problem below!He was very professional while other colleagues in the shop kept being exasperated while saying customer services are rubbish and then saying we have a new system no one knows how to use and left it at that.Customer services on the phone were absolutely awful - has taken so many months to activate the virgin media O2 deal because our data was inputted incorrectly and created duplicate accounts! Customer service either had no clue virgin media was pairing with O2 or kept transferring you to people all equally as unhelpful.Ashley finally sorted it for us!,1
"Credit where credit is due 02 are actually doing something about the issues with the handset and all is getting sorted thanks you 02And yet another 5 hours and 20 minutes over two days of time to 02 customer service with no help. My problem is I have missed my bill this month but 02 cannot do anything about it ok it's my fault for missing the payment all I asked for was a extension of time in which I got refused.........I have been suffering with 02 no service for just over 6 months due to masts being down as they informed me there is nothing that they can do because it's in my small print in a contract I signed.It basically started that if 02 are down it's my problem because they don't actually have to provide a service lol but I pay for a service, that I'm not actually receiving. I asked for a extension of time (as I have bared with them) to make the payment but no they are unable to help.Anyone who is reading this please do research and go with a better network provider if you fall in the same category as me they won't help you with a service or help with payment.",1
"I have had the same mobile number since 1994, I have been an O2 customer since it was BT Cellnet (Yes, I am that old). They really need to do better at customer relations, they are abysmal, and now, 5G, what a joke that is, I have had to restrict my phone to 4G to ensure a signal, on 5G is is like using dial up modems again. I was once an engineer working on the O2 cell towers, they used to have a decent power output - they don't now, of all the cell providers in the UK, their towers have the lowest output of the lot - and that is purely to save money on electricity costs, certianly not provide an adequate service for customers - and I use the adjective Adequate advisadly...I cannot, in all conscience recommend them, and when my contract is up I will finally transfer to a new provider - I haven't until now through laziness on my part, but enough is enough.",1
"My phone was stolen on Monday and O2 immediately blocked my number which was amazing. Thank you O2 for working so quickly.I went into store to get a new sim but since I’m on my Dad’s plan for multi sim discount, I wasn’t allowed to do ANYTHING, despite my name being attached to my number and since my dad is in a different city, I travelled there to go into a store to get my sim. Unfortunately they didn’t check whether my number had been blocked in store and it turns out my number had been double barred (whatever that means) which meant I will not have had a connection to the O2 network for nearly 48 hours instead of the usual 24 hours. The customer service assistant did apologise for this, which I appreciate but it would have been so much easier if O2 would allow authorised contacts instead of only talking to the account holder because I would have been able to solve it much, much earlier and also get my sim earlier.Please O2, allow authorised contacts so that this doesn’t inconvenience people in the future.",1
"The performance of O2 SIM's card varies - some days it works well, while other days it doesn't work as well.",1
"O2 the guys in your shops are fantastic but sadly I can’t get onto the shop when I’m working so sadly have to call customer services. Please please please O2 start employing some English speaking staff, the last three times I have had to call you guys I have had to repeat myself over and over again it’s sooooo frustrating and must be hard for the call centre guys too, I also don’t have time to spend half an hour on the phone for something that should be done in 5 minutes without the language barrier… honestly really thinking of getting rid of O2",1
"O2 can either be very good or very poor. For example they sent me a phone case I didn't order and charged me for it.It really depends on the advisor, some are very knowledgeable and helpful. While some are not.",1
Im not happy with the ssrvice 02 provides i never have any signal it doesnt matter where i am i have never got beyond a joke as my job consists of traveling alot and i live in a city!,1
"I upgraded to the z fold 3 don't get me wrong it came after being delivered to a different address. Quite disappointed that it didn't come with a plug since the charger isn't a USB end, no screen protectors, no headphones when you buy cheaper phones you get the lot so why not the same with the newer phones. It definitely should come with at least a plug for the charger.",1
"The prices are cheap, but the quality and speed are terrible. You get what you pay for..",1
"I’ve been saddled with O2 by Virgin. Out of the 3 mobile numbers registered on Virgin Family plan 1 number was transferred to O2 and is visible on MyO2 app and the other 2 numbers were transferred to O2 but are parked somewhere on the system. I have no access to them via O2 app and so can’t manage spend, allowances etc. but O2 are still dutifully charging me for them. After about 6 months of on-off chasing O2 unsuccessfully to merge 3 numbers on my account I got fed up and told them to stuff it. The customer service was 50/50, some tried to help but had no idea how, others were incompetent and rude. Then I discovered that Virgin tied me into O2 via their Volt package and if I ditch O2 then my Virgin broadband doubles in price. After another few hours of my life on the phone to Virgin and O2 that I’ll never get back Virgin told me they managed to remove O2 ‘benefit’ from my Volt package and keep my discount and I can now cancel O2. Virgin phoned O2 themselves and then transferred me through to get PAC codes for the 3 numbers I wanted to move out of O2. This time I finally got through to somebody with brains in the UK call center. They explained how to set up alternative account for my other 2 numbers and couldn’t have been more helpful and knowledgeable and managed to persuade me to stay with O2 for another 12 months by taking a third off my bill.  Maybe Virgin have access to better level of O2 customer service because whenever I phoned O2 directly I ended up speaking to somebody in overseas call centers with poor English and wrong attitude.Anyway, my overall rating is 3 stars: I did get what I wanted (access to other 2 numbers and reduced contract cost) but customer service is very poor and transfer from Virgin to O2 was crap.",1
"My overall experience with O2 has been mixed. There is no other way to describe it.Let's start off with the positives.I have what I would call an unbeatable deal from O2 thanks to the Virgin Mobile migration. My phone bill is £6.79/mo for completely unlimited data (on VM, it was for 2GB, plan price was originally 2GB for a 12 month contract in 08/2018), which no other network would ever be able to beat. I currently use around 40GB in a month, which is a stark contrast to never using over 4GB in a month for 5 years. Granted my usage habits have changed now that I'm free to burn my data.Through the Virgin Mobile migration, I also gained the ability to use 4G calling and WiFi calling (yes Virgin did have the ability for both, but it just would have been a pain to set up) from the moment I migrated. Unfortunately, these features did disappear for a long time (from about July to mid-December) which sucks. I don't make calls often but both options make calls crystal clear and reliable.A bit after mid-November, I decided to get a SIM swap with O2, since I was still using my old Virgin SIM (which was originally programmed to connect to the EE network, still have remnants of that even with my new O2 SIM with the T-Mobile MNC seemingly reporting ""Virgin Mobile"" when manually searching for networks). The SIM swap processed extremely quickly with being delivered within just 2 days (one day after my order confirmation), which was a stark contrast from the experience that I had with moving someone from Plusnet to EE (SIM took 4 days to deliver and EE didn't even send confirmation details).Priority is a cool plus to have and getting Volt features is nice too.Now the negatives.With the migration, I was promised the visual voicemail feature on my Android phone, but it has yet to work for me. I've had a tab for it appear once, but that's it.On Virgin, RCS always worked perfectly fine. Meanwhile on O2, I've had a few problems (particularly by the migration from O2's RCS to Jibe RCS) and it's left me unable to use RCS.I'd like to finally end this off with a concern I have for the future as an O2 customer. Due to the way that O2 migrated Virgin customers, my tariff price is £13.29 with a £6.50 discount bolt-on. I am concerned that the annual price increases will cost more on O2 than it would of on Virgin due to the way that the migration was handled.",1
Too expensive but stuck with them since they took over from Virgin mobile,1
Decent network been with them years. Never had any major issues,1
Moved from Vodafone hoping for better network.Absolutely rubbish! Do better O2,1
"I don't really have any issues with O2, have been a customer for many years, I do however think they can improve by using another delivery company instead of DHL Parcels UK, I was offered next day delivery by O2 for my upgrade. Still no sign, should of been delivered 31/10/22. Seems I'm not the only one having problems. O2 needs to get a reliable delivery company not fraudsters.",1
"As of the time of writing this review, one of our contracts has been canceled, and we're hoping it stays that way. Prior to this, my family had three contracts: one for myself, one for my dad, and one for my little brother. My dad and I had a generally positive experience with our contracts, with only occasional internet signal issues, which were infrequent and didn't significantly affect our overall satisfaction.Now, let's delve into the canceled contract concerning my little brother. Approximately two months ago, he temporarily lost his phone, but he managed to retrieve it the following day. On the day the phone was lost, we promptly contacted the service provider to report it and have the number barred. We were informed that we'd need to wait for 24 hours for the bar to be lifted, which we accepted. However, for the following three days, my brother couldn't make calls or use data. We reached out to customer support, only to be advised that switching SIM cards would be quicker. We visited the first store in Wembley, but my brother failed to answer the security questions and lacked the required identification, which, understandably, the store couldn't overlook.We then tried another store in Edgware while I was taking care of my car. We brought two forms of ID and proof of billing, and requested a new SIM card. However, we faced the same issue with security questions and ID verification. The system seemed to have a glitch in specifying which security question to answer. We contacted the service provider, and it turned out that my brother had two security questions and answers, and the system wasn't clear on which one to use. Despite answering correctly, the issue persisted.After trying to resolve the problem for several days, including obtaining multiple SIM cards and switching to different phones, we realized the problem wasn't with the SIM but likely linked to my brother's account. The service provider promised to investigate, but after a week, they requested another week to continue their inquiry. Keep in mind that we made repeated calls during this process, and sometimes the support team didn't have the necessary information, forcing us to provide it repeatedly.After waiting for over a month and a half with no resolution in sight, we decided to cancel the contract. Fortunately, we were given credit, so we didn't have to pay, but it became apparent that having a contract was pointless if we couldn't use the SIM. Interestingly, we switched to Giffgaff, which operates on the same network as our previous provider (O2), using the PAC code for our number, and everything worked perfectly. As such, I don't expect a cancellation bill, as I left the contract due to the absence of service, which should be evident in their records. It appears that my account was disabled at the time of writing this review.",1
Transferred over from virgin to o2 definitely an improvement over virgin mobile network has a smoother experience coverage is great at my home very poor at my work but this service is very cheap compared to the competitors seems to be better than my experience with o2 two years ago,1
O2used to be good until thay merged with virgin media,1
"I have changed the provider for 02, not quit what I expected ...",1
Good service all round. But I think advisors need to explain certain terms of deals such as O2 Switch Up. The problem is it’s being advertised as upgrade your phone whenever you want from the day you to take the contract. But actually it’s after 14 days of purchase. Falsely advertised.,1
"Customer for 5+ years and the experience goes down every time I roll off a contract. Coverage and features of the service, generally very good. Customer service and the transparency of billing and switching, terrible. Really struggle to get the best deal, and billing transparency is next to nothing when there's a change - email updates do tell you what it's going to be, but not why (or even if) there's a change.",1
Mobile phone providers are all pants lets face it however O2 have impressed me by now auto moving you to SIM only once handset is paid off not like the rest who just take the extra profit until you realise or pushing upgrade onto you - reception could be better!,1
The service in the cinema for popcorn and drinks is abysmal. 10 mins per customer. Never seen anything like it,1
"I have been a loyal 02 custome for over ten years. Yesterday I wanted an additional contract for my 14yrs old son. I spoke to a gentleman called Tom. He was very helpful and professional. As we were about to complete the deal the system went down and he could not proceed. He apologised and kindly asked me to call back today. I called back this morning. I was holding on for over 30 minutes just to speak to someone who was inpatient, not will to help and would not give consideration to the conversation I had with her colleague the previous day. So I had to choice but to contact another provider for a new contract for my son. I'm really disappointed and would not be renewing my contract with 02 when it expires",1
Download speed is mostly ok but upload speed is useless max I have seen is between a shocking 0.1mbps to Max of 10mbps sure this service is cheaper than Vodafone and EE but have to remember that you get what you pay for customer service not good either you will be waiting over 30 minutes to speak with someone and there is no function like Vodafone to receive your call back in turn I have just moved to this network it is cheaper but service is so so,1
"Website is awful. PAYG top up won't allow you to paste a credit card number in, then moans you have typed the number in wrong. Wouldn't be an issue if you would allow the number to be pasted in!Then there is no way of contacting them to provide feedback on this, even the complaints service is hidden behind some live chat thing, just want an email address at least. Not hard really.The irony of this review is the notification box at the bottom is the only place I have spotted an email address for O2!",1
"Been with O2 for about 10 years and honestly they're average as far as phone networks go, like I've never actually had much issue with the network itself but I will say if you go anywhere out of London your signal will defo suffer as oppose to being inside of London. I'm planning on leaving O2 soon not for the network coverage but the price of paying off a phone, my family have always been with O2 and me and my dad have always gotten our phones from O2 but as I've gotten older I've realised how much you overpay, and it stems mostly from paying your for your phone over a long period, I currently have an IPhone 12 and got it from O2 and honestly really regret it. The problem with paying off Phones is the fact that they go down in value from year to year, so I've now given O2 around 600+ pounds for a phone in present day it's worth about 200, used which is insane, obviously tech does do go down in value as it gets older but wow a 400 pound loss is very bad especially cause eventually I am planning on selling it and buying a newer phone, there's also the sim costs which are completely overpriced and stupid O2 seems to have a minimum that they want you to pay cause in some cases 8gb of mobile data will be the same as 4gb in price and will go down very little in value which isn't good if your attempting to save money by cutting off data that's not in use, there's also no incentive anymore for me to stay on the same network as my family or people I talk to as lowered pricing for texting and calling for people on the same network really don't exist anymore as most people are on unlimited contracts as it's literally cheaper. I'm mostly likely going to be switching to a lesser known network which picky backs off of the Three network like Smarty or Honest Mobile due to their less expensive and non contract nature and saying goodbye to O2 cause it's wayyy to expensive to justify using. Thanks.",1
I had £10 PAYG bundle and I think o2 a very good reliable network but have they still got that really silly voice message at the start of every call you make that says 'BUNDLE CALL' nobody's going to want to hear that when using phone. This has gone on for years and no other network payg make you go through this annoying garbage. Grow up o2. Unless they do it to force you to get sim only contract. Will be going vodafone with no silly messages before voice call.,1
Been with these guys for a third of my life and they have been top notch for years. I have had issues with them every so often but never like this one recently which has made them loose two stars. I had issues with my signal as a mast went down near by and it took them over a month to sort it out. My work was heavily affected by this and I never got any compensation from them. As a loyal customer I expected better service...,1
"I rarely feel motivated to review a company that is neither wonderful or dreadful, so my reviews tend to be all or nothing.  Here's is a company I really have no strong feelings about.  It's reasonably cheap, the calls work fine, and there are rarely outages, but the website is a pain in the behind.  I can't honestly recommend them, but nor can I be bothered to leave them.",1
"I suffered  a delay for the transfer of my previous phone number to the O2 SIM.   The online support was not at all useful but when I was eventually able to talk to an O2 human, she was polite, efficient and helpful.O2 owners and managers should not believe that their IT systems will ever be as good for their customers as  a human agent.   Only the simple queries can be properly dealt with via their support line.",1
"4G signal is terrible considering that they have low bands, 3G signal is great but when you're getting 1.4Mbps down and 0.6Mbps up its pretty useless and even when 4G signal is good the best I get is 5.7Mbps down and 0.1Mbps up. Avoid. I left Three for these and shouldn't have bothered.Now down to one star, numerous reports about the network issues, many texts saying work is happening in the area only to find no improvements what so ever.Offered a reduced package which I am happy with (less data), since now I've taken out broadband. Customer service on this occasion was actually spectacular!",1
"Overall Average, their contracts are sometimes a little expensive for what you get, live chat experts half the time can’t answer your question which slows things down, Connectivity is average not the fastest speeds slow at times. Just a very basic and average experience overall. Not sure if I’d recommend O2.",1
"I got lucky on 2nd attempt and the lady was very very professional. But the first person was an animal. As a NHS worker feeling the strain I understand why, but that doesn't make it acceptable. I have spent several years in NHS and also in the Financial sector prior to that and treat people as I wanted to be treated. So o2 either you working your staff to hard and need to sort your capacity or you need to give some vial people the boot",1
"My husband needed a new phone, so went to Worthing O2 shop. Service couldn’t have been better (5 stars for them!!) , in that they were really busy, so very nice guy in there took phone number and said that he would ring when an advisor was free, to save hanging around in the shop. We were then dealt with by Victoria, who could not have been nicer or more helpful. HOWEVER - I then tried to contact O2 Customer Services to compliment the Worthing shop. Ended up completely defeated by impenetrable system (NO stars for them!!) - maybe I won’t change my phone to O2 after all…..",1
"I've been a SIM-only customer for a year, which I got at a fairly good price (20GB for £21). It's a good price (considering it's O2), but the coverage is not what I remember of O2 to have before. It's been pretty disappointing, especially when commuting, and making me consider switching to other providers when my contract is up.",1
"Called up to cancel an airtime plan which I no longer had a use for. Initially I was advised that I could not pass security and therefore could not cancel this, I then spoke with someone else, went through security fine (my answers had not changed) and have managed to get the matter resolved. I really do wonder what nincompoops get employed here at times!",1
I’ve always been a bit of a fan of the O2 but when they tried to Renew my car insurance with a card which was obviously out of date and then charge me £20 to renew it I think this is less than business like they have charged me now the £20 saying it was my fault that I didn’t give them an update on the card,1
I have recently left O2 having been with them for a good few years.It has been noticeable that whilst away from the home the service has been poor with O2 having no connection whilst my family who use other providers have had a signal.Although the coverage was poor I have to say that customer service was excellent every time I contacted them.,1
"Moved from EE and had nothing but hassle from day one, luckily still within 14 day cancellation period and it's headed that way. Feels like they want to blame customers for issues and once signed up are no longer interested in you.i have given 2 stars as expecting a call today to get resolution but it should be one or less,doubt it will happen and if not I will be returning their phone and cancelling my contract...O2 came back and resolved the issue, was just a bad store experience.",1
Ordered a Samsung Gear VR from the o2 shop. The check out was very painful and i had to key details multiple times before it eventually went through. If another supplier had of had stock i would gone elsewhere. Pre sale experience 1 Star.Item however arrived next day with a fully tracked service and the after purchase experience was 5 star so overall 3 stars from me.,1
"I""ve found that  when I contact O2   via the phone usually good service, but go to a branch and you""re lucky to find someone who knows what they""re talking about.Had a terrible experience at Brentwood where the assistant suddenly ran off with my debit card and made a copy of it--I managed to get photocopy destroyed. All she kept asking me was I happy with the ""service""!!! she gave.  NO I WASN""T.",1
"Ok customer service used to be soo much better. Certainly better than the other competitors. I have had a contract with these guys for over 15 years now. They used to be so good in retaining customers, however lately I don't think they care anymore. They are definitely the most expensive network out there. I would recommend go via carphone warehouse if you want an O2 upgrade or contract. The same tariff at carphone for O2 will be cheaper than actually going direct with O2. I know you'd think it would be the opposite.",1
"I've been with O2 10+ years and have an iPhone with them, so far so good in most respects. Apart from one, and it's so bizarre I find it almost unforgiveable for a mobile company. They text you your bill and in the text is a web address to manage your account. Click on that link though, and you go through to a site optimised for desktop users only. Not mobile users. Um what does this company do again:)?",1
Been with O2 (and previously BT Cellnet) for over 10 years now. Signal is always very good but recently the cost of being with this network vs other is terrible. I have NEVER been rewarded for contract renewals and by renewing an iPhone contract with them as opposed to moving network I am actually WORSE off.When phoning problems I get transferred from here to there and spend hours holding. Disappointing.,1
"Even after the cost of the 'free phones' was covered, they kept taking those rentals for year after year, without ever once informing me that, maybe, just maybe, I was not getting a fair bill for the one or two calls that I made per month. Just kept on taking the money.That is, until I wised up. And I would probably slill be  paying, except that they got greedy!!!!!!",1
"Variable service, not the phones but the company.  Sme issues sorted out really quickly, some things can take months.  I have a £10/month contract with mins, free texts and a good phone, which is well cheap.  Broadband and webmail problems have taken a very long time to sort out in the past though.  In short a good value product as well as you dont get faults.",1
"It seems o2 are very good at training their staff to turn every inquiry or question into a sales opportunity. Instead of providing a real sense of concern about a question they pitch you. This has happened more than once, but not always. When it does happen and I hear the pitch about this or that I get quite cross. I can say I have found their prices competitive and would not be inclined to switch ...unless I loose it next time they start blabbing at me.",1
"Hit and miss. Staff in franchise stores are clearly less regulated than the company itselfs employees, having contacted O2 with many issues, their complaints team have handled them remarkably. I would love to see a little more loyalty to customers like me on upgrades, and also a few less issues in the first place.",1
I have stuck with o2 since it was btcellnet and my current contract is my last. I don't like them increasing my bill every year no matter how little they say it is and I don't like a £3 late payment charge. O2 used to be about me but now it's all about the money. Shame on you O2 you could be so much more!,1
"Fair contract prices, but website as a bit confusing(used u switch to review packages and prices for SIM only contracts) on line order was fairly easy, although my number port authorisation ws slightly delayed and only way to contact was live webchat, which wasn't easy with overseas workers and some parts of the communication were lost in translation, although they did try their best and got things back on track. Using the O2 app for billing, info etc.  All in all, I'm finding O2 okay as it stands and nothing particularly poor to report-long may this continue.",1
"This is a difficult one to write because I spent a couple of days not getting anywhere and was really annoyed , I read the bad reviews and that made me angrier and I felt they were giving me the runaround . I eventually managed to speak to a person ( 3 in all) and they were so helpful it made my bad robot experience fade and my problem is now sorted . Why do large companies insist on these awful press 1 - 6 choices and then after hours of trying not getting anyone . ..... Thankyou humans for being so helpful but decision makers get rid of the robot answer machines .",1
"I switched to o2 from Virgin Mobile after I noticed a new o2 mast on Lytton Way in Stevenage about 400 yards from me in autumn 2020.  Using only 4G at the moment I regularly get 150 meg down but only get 4 meg up and pings over 35 ms which is not ideal as my internet radio cuts out regularly but streaming HD video is fine.In June 2021 I noticed that 5G was available from Three in my area so I tried iD Mobile.  Wow, what a difference, 275 down, a whopping 60 up and pings of 16 ms.  Internet radio has never been better and streaming 4K video is faultless.  Sorry o2, I'm gone for good.",1
"I have been with o2 for nearly 8 years now and I am always on simplicity tariff as I cant have any good deals from o2 .Thinking many times to leave this provider .. I called the customer service centre to see if they have good deal for loyal customers .I found nothing worth buying new contract from them as they are more expensive than other providers,disappointed totally  .I hope they review their prices  policy especially  towards their loyal customers .Thank you",1
I haven’t had internet on my phone since getting my new sim. I called 3 weeks prior spoke two 2 people that hadn’t a clue and one that was very rude. Got told I she would call back that day she didn’t so I had to ring back up and was on hold for half an hour. I then was meant to have 24 hr call back 3 weeks later I get a pop up saying my 4g no longer working on my account and still no internet. I rang up this morning and spoke to a lady called Cheryl where she was 3 weeks ago I don’t Know the Only person to actually solve my problem and was so lovely. 5 star service to Cheryl for helping me.,1
HelloBeen with O2 in total 8 years and never had a problem untill 3g came into use its really bad and once again local masts are over crowded with too many ppl using there data ....Only reason i stayed was because of there customer services always have tried to help but untill there 3g network dont improve goodbye O2..Plus the rpi every year they raise ur monthly bill which is total nonsenseIf ur making money please also improve ur network....Thanks O2 for all them years but im off...,1
"I've had a bit of a bad experience with o2 recently. I use my text messages a lot and some of them have taken quite a long time to arrive.O2 said that, once you send a text, it can take up to 72h to arrive. I was surprised at that as most of the time, the text messages get there right away. Sorry o2 but only 3stars.",1
"I can't say I had good service from O2 but over 2 years I never had a problem and didn't spend hours on hold. IFar better than Vodafone who made mistakes every time I renewed.I've also trailed Three, Lyca and Talk Mobile for 1 month each just to try before I by and each one was really really bad.",1
"I was with O2 a little over a month, the service was fine day to day, but I live near a football pitch and every time a match was on the network would fall over.I had to call customer service a couple of times as there was a delay in porting my number over, every time I called they were really friendly and helpful and sorted me out.In the end, I'm a heavy user and I like streaming music/videos etc. and the network wasn't strong enough to handle this, so I've left. But for anyone else it would be a great network.",1
"Some good and bad things. This was the first network I used, and I used them for years. The price was definitely on the high end (bad) on the other hand, the signal reach was very strong and I rarely ran into deadzones in London. Ended up switching networks due to costs.",1
I ordered home mobile broadband with the 30day rolling contract but the process was far from smooth. It took multiple phone calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package. I had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim card which would save me some money - but I had to repeat that I did not want this and wanted the mobile broadband only. The actual service has been good so far but getting there was a pain to say the least.,1
"I have never had a moment's problem with my O2 phone!  Mine is a simple one as I only want it for making and receiving phone calls and texts.  Being an only child, and having lived on my own at certain times of my life, I appreciate having knowing that I can now be connected easily to everyone else.  At the same time, I don't get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call.  Then there are the frequent competitions, which are fun, the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome.",1
Manchester Arndale store service is utterly awful. Too many bodies for very little work. The staff have a can't be bothered attitude. Majority of the staff are looking at their own phones.Online service was excellent. Omar was very helpful and managed to find us a good deal.,1
"I've had quite a few dealings with o2 in the last 12 months.  There have been some good experiences and some absolutely disgraceful ones. I find that if you get through to the overseas agents then you are in trouble, they don't seem to have had much training at all and it shows. It's something when I know my rights more than they do. Its really bad but I just usually keep trying until I get the UK based call centre. I find the live chat is the best option but even then you can be there a while if your query is out of the ordinary.",1
"I have been an o2 customer for 6 years now. Every year it gets worse...I wanted to upgrade my phone recently and it would appear that new customers get the deal I wanted @ £25 a month whilst an upgrade customers (myself) must pay £31! How unfair is this!Also, ringing their Customer Service is a nightmare! You keep waiting for about 40 minutes before someone actually decides to pick up the phone!I have been quite happy with call charges, data charges etc, just a pitty that I do not feel valued as a long term customer.",1
Been with O2 for a quite a few years now (mobile phone & broadband). Have had really good experience with broadband support when needed but recently have found their prices increasing making them the most expensive of the popular providers rather than the value provider they used to be.,1
"Been with o2 from 2016 and that time the service it was great but now the internet is very slow, (3 star only for the past experience)PS my partner has a budget provider which has better signal and internet at a lower cost.",1
"They changed my contract, said I can leave without penalties. I left. Then I have received a bill for 300£, called them they apologized said they gonna fix it. Today 300£ left my bank account.Update:Refunded.",1
"Been with o2 for years always got good customer  service, however  today I really got the impression  the person I spoke to hated his job.",1
"I've been with o2 since I was a child, I'm now 25. I had never had any problems with o2 until I recently tried to upgrade my phone.Without going into too much detail, they basically fudged up the upgrade and made me return the handset and said I had to go through the whole upgrade process again. All because of their own misleading sales team.I was left without a phone for almost 2 weeks as things were delayed etc. Made a complaint and they did actually resolve it well and to my satisfaction.Will continue to use o2... for now anyway...! :)",1
I have been with o2 for 12 years and originally had brilliant broadband with them too until they sold it to sky. The main thing that kept me with o2 was the original fantastic customer service. Unfortunately this has dwindled over the years…and especially since Telefonica.I have recently had two enquiries. One rep was abrupt abs made me feel stupid for not knowing the answer to my question already and closed the conversation by hanging up. The second was more helpful.I also looked for sim only upgrade options but none came near the one available on U switch- the fact they would they not offer loyal customers their best deals says it all about how the company has gone really.,1
"Lets get one thing straight.... I loved O2, the staff were fantastic but I was forced to change internet suppliers once my first year contract ran out and they had no unlimited internet package even tho I had been on one for 12 months - The old new customers only nonsense.",1
I recently upgraded my phone online and was happy that I got a good deal for the handset I wanted but it didn't arrive on the day it was expected and I had to really push for compensation for the wasted day.I also had to explain the problem to 3 different people on their 'chat' facility because you can't always get the same person and the 202  phone number on their website didn't work!The support felt very faceless to me and I didn't really feel like they cared about my custom given that I've been with them for over 10 years!,1
"I have been with O2 for sometime and the service is average for the amount I pay each month. They are not interested in helping when there is a problem and slow to fix any problems, even when it is there fault. The signal is very weak in many areas.",1
I have recently purchased a prepay phone from O2 however I had a difficult time finding their track your order button. I wish they could have listed in on their footer for easier access rather than digging deeper to how many pages I have been redirected,1
I always had a good service with O2 for 7 years on contract. However when it came to renewal this year I left as they no longer had customer loyalty discounts. So I immediately switched network (t-mobile) and it's just as good yet reasonably priced!,1
I've been with O2 since they were BT Cellnet and have always been happy with the service until recently.   O2 now default to 36 month contracts which are the same (or dearer) than other major network's 24 month contract.  At my last renewal I took out an O2 24 month contract on a P30 Pro with triple data (45GB) on a third party provider for £20 per month cheaper than I could get it from O2 themselves.  How does that work?? I even got a free Sonos speaker!!My wife has switched to Vodafone unlimited max for less than she was paying for 12gb with O2Sadly from O2 having 5 contracts in our house they will find themselves with none,1
"I switched to O2 when my old contract with Vodafone wasn't renewed as they couldn't provide a decent signal at home.The cost of the data O2 charge is crazy compared to some but the refresh contracts are a great idea! Being able to pay my handset off in smaller amounts and knowing I can 'buy out' of my contract is a great way to stay in control. However, their 4G service does need work as it can be really, really slow which isn't great when considering their data charges.Otherwise, not had a problem with their customer service team who are normally pretty good at providing advice in my experiences anyway!",1
"I have generally been happy with O2 service, no major issues, they have replaced faulty handsets without issue, but they are let down by their email/web support, which is outsourced to india and as usual they do not read your emails properly or do not understand  and you end up having to repeat yourself several times only to be told they cannot help you and you need to call support.You really need to call them from the start to avoid this issue as their phone support is email based.They are however better in every way than Orange or Vodafone.--sadly things went downhill since I posted this, so I have since posted a new one.",1
"The network can let you down sometimes - recently I had bought the O2 mobile broadband service but it never worked as well as I would have expected it to. Also, it promised free access to BT Openzone but that would never work.",1
"I  really don’t like o2, but first, credit where credit’s due:Good coverage,Good insurance,Good web UI,Good fraud reporting system.- BUT- very overpriced compared to eg Giffgaff (which is also owned by the same Spanish Telefónica company who own o2, and MoviStar- but you don’t get that in the UK)- totally inflexible plans - costs £10 for 1 extra gig if you run out!- Poor customer service; they’ve got very long waiting times. If you call ‘threatening’ to quit, they won’t sweet talk you, just try and get rid of you.- leaving ASAP for some flexible & affordable data.- Phones are pricey through them too.Addendum: you have to wonder what data leak on their end causes all the scammers to have o2 numbers. Probably using some archaic unprotected database",1
Cheap for what you get. Coverage is patchy at best in the countryside. Not for you if you live in the UK countryside or plan on travelling inside the UK. Great value for London + abroad.,1
"My phone works reasonably well with little problems. I think the value is average with little appreciation of its loyal customers, When renewal of contract is due. Its like they dont care which is to often the case.",1
"I have been loyal to o2 since owning a mobile phone. I love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where I live (in the sticks) however, the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly frustrating. They couldn't understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn't helped the problem at all. Next time, I think I will send it to HTC directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when I explained it to them. Apart from that, o2 are still a good company, but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors.",1
"It took them ages to activate my SIM card... Very annoying. Now everything is ok, but I wouldn't buy a new SIM from them again. And the online customer service team wasn't very helpful...",1
Had no issues for 12 - 14 months... started to experience network issues in my place of residence...at 1st very helpful but then the online gurus started to become increasingly uninterested ... for want of better words... I have  3 x O2 contract mobiles in my home ... when sitting them side by side ... 2 x have 3 to 4 bar reception whilst mine has 1 or none and when answering a call the phone dies.... I hasten to add that no call problems previously.... Was told not their problem you receive a signal out with your property so they have fulfilled their part of the contract... not acceptable I'm afraid .... have been loyal customer for 20+ years with O2 and BT mobile before that... another custo er lost as soon as contract up in July...,1
I just got a sim only contract with o2 under the assumption that I would be able to use volt with virgin media to double my data (as advertised).Unfortunately they do not tell you that if you receive any other perk from virgin media this means that you cannot use this volt feature without disabling the other.This makes zero sense considering it’s a different company.They really should make this known.As it is they actually say not to try and activate this feature until 14 days which seemed very suspicious to me (hence why I rang the moment I got the contract).The 3 stars is for the actual service which is very stable and is actually faster to respond and load media than my three sim but lacks 5g anywhere in my city or surrounding areas so I can’t give it full stars.Unfortunately I will be cancelling within my 14 day window due to these issues.,1
"I have been with 02 now for 2 weeks and my phone still isn't working !Every time I try and log on it just says ""there seems to be a problem try again in a couple of minutes.",1
"I was concerned about the lengthy and somewhat overbearing security my husband and myself experienced at Jeff Lynne's ELO  gig on 20.10.18.  I of course, understand the need for heightened security in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack..  However, my husband was submitted to a fairly intimate body check and my small bag was given an extensive search rather than the  quick glance I am used to.  There seemed to be no apparent cause for this other than perhaps our outward appearance.  We are both  obviously aged over 55 and have disabilities). Our only reason for attending this gig was for a fun nostalgic evening, for which we paid a good deal of money.  Your ""customer safety"" people rather spoilt the tone of the evening to start with.",1
Previous customer. On the plus side great coverage in the areas i live and work. Down side missing the mark on pricing. Saving at least 30% by switching,1
"Went abroad and added the O2 travel bolt on to my account in order to use minutes, texts and data. Returned home from abroad to find they have charged me for roaming charges (Data) although I had the O2 travel bolt on. Spoke to customer service and explained why I shouldn't have these charges which they agreed and rightly removed the roaming charges. The dishonest part is them telling me I used my phone for Data roaming before I activated my O2 travel bolt on even though I didn't switch my mobile data on until i received email confirmation the bolt on was active. When I made the point to customer service, that it didn't make sense they didn't seem to have an answer. Obvious they were trying to make out it was my mistake when in actual fact it was a mistake on their part in order to avoid me asking them to compensate for their mistake. Will definitely be looking to move from the network once my contract expires if this is how they treat their loyal customers.",1
I got an iphone 6 delivered and on a decent rate contract. However mid contract o2 decided to increase the price and I have no get out so just have to pay this. Not happy with this.,1
Very ignorant. Eventually had my issue resolved,1
"Why is it long standing customers get the same deal as new customers,when they are due for a upgrade?This does not encourage loyalty when other companies offer better deals.",1
"So I have a two year contract with O2 and I specifically told them I wanted my service capped. Since then they have invented all sorts of reasons to charge more. They have the technology to adhere to this contract but shows no interest in it as they feel they must grow their income at customers expense. The long and short of it from a £27 monthly contract my bill has been raised to £41 on account of phoning a number which cost  no more on a land line than normal rate. Spoke to an agent and paid the $33 difference who decide to revoke the fee and resume my service only to find two days later the service cut off and a demand for the £8 pounds. Been a customer for nearly two years , contract due for renewal Jan, needless to say , I will not be renewing. Thats not the best way to treat people after paying up to date.",1
"I don't have many problems with O2. Yes their coverage is not as good as some networks and so is patchy at times, but they're generally okay",1
Experience has been alright. I have good reception but prices are crazy.,1
Everything seems to be challenging with o2 from upgrading phones for our business to getting support from their business team. Needs a real shake up!,1
"Came time to renew and phoned up to ask for the contract to be terminated. Fair enough, they asked why and went through some options.  Gave me what seemed a good deal to stay with the network and . . . the confirmation they sent through quickly did not mention cost, nor did ANY contact with them.  I didn't get a confirmation by email either about what I had signed up to.I was rather naive I admit taking their word for it.  Came time for the bills and they didn't give me what I asked for - in fact instead of it being £24 per month it was £37.  And of course, despite the 'your call could be recorded' routine, they couldn't find a record of the conversation anywhere.  Morale. Reasonable coverage and service - just CHECK and ask for confirmation in writing of anything they say. They can't be trusted in that way",1
"Just joined O2 from three as I have poor signal. I have already been sent a bill despite not even having my sim card yet whish is, I think, a bit rich",1
"i emailed the customer service team, they said it would take 2 days to come back to me but i was more like 5, when they did come back they resolved my issue though.",1
"This is an appeal to everyone who may have experienced the same problem!!!A recruitment agent managed to leave a message on my mobile without letting me take the telephone call. I was in the city centre where I had maximum signal. I was holding my O2 mobile phone in my hand because I was expecting a recruitment agent to give me a call.Suddenly my mobile phone vibrated once. I was getting ready to answer the call but the call never came. In a few second I received a message from O2 to say that I had a voice message. It puzzled me because my phone had no missed call, and the signal was at maximum, so there was no problem for me to take the call. I went to O2 boutique, a technician said that it may be a problem with my SIM card. When I asked whether O2 was selling a service that would allow agencies to leave messages at will, the guy refused to answer!!! Does anyone know anything like this?",1
"I had been with O2 for a number of years, and generally their service was above average.However, I moved house, and that was the beginning of a very sorry saga.  In a period of 15 months I had 6 routers.  Each one had a different problem, ranging from getting so hot, I did not need heating, random drop outs, disconnections, and the list goes on.Finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided, I contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act together.  In fairness the customer service were every helpful, waiving the early termination fees.  But, it is only since I have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has become increasingly apparent.  Since I have changed, I am not able to get a wireless signal anywhere in the house.  Not just sat on top of the router.This review is now a little redundant as Sky is buying out O2s' customer base.",1
"Seem to treat different customers in a different manner. Called Sir when I'm a business customer, Alan if I have a problem with my personal phone.",1
The phone service is always helpful but every time I have spoken to live chat they end up getting it wrong. This time sent us the incorrect sim cards.,1
Must say the event was perfect but leading up it was awful trying to get through to customer services please please fix this!,1
good coverage not bad pricing only gripe is 24 month contracts but been with them since it was cellnet 17 years so they must be doing something right,1
"Used O2 on a pay monthly contract for 3 years. They would always offer very good discounts when my contract was up for renewal, and the customer service is helpful and easy to get a hold of. However this year they couldn't offer a good enough discount so I changed provider. When I phoned to get the PAC code, I was told by the operator I could terminate my contract anytime 30 days before the contract termination date, as there was a 30 day notice anyway. However now I have received my last bill and they have charged me for a contract termination fee equivalent to 2 months of contract. When I phoned the customer service they were apologetic that the operator I talked to didn't make me aware of this at the time but I personally feel I have been tricked into paying these fees.All in all, O2 is just as good as any other provider and offer competitive rates, but make sure you thoroughly ask them about fees before you terminate your contract with them!",1
Why is your VAT ridiculous now and why do you KEEP on raising my bill. I'm going to be paying £45 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone,1
My grip is the broadband I have with them the service could be better I've been with O2 a few years and you don't get anything for loyalty,1
Have moved from Vodafone after ten years (ouch!) as O2 offered a good deal and Vodafone couldnt match it. Have so far been pleasantly surprised.,1
"We have a couple of iPhones and Blackberries with O2. The service is usually problem free, but we find that 3G coverage is really hit and miss.",1
Very limited 4g coverage in central london and surrounding areas.  Vodafone was much better.O2 priority makes it just about worthwhile.,1
"The website was a nightmare to use for me after mix up with my details left me with 2 different online 'identities' attached to one phone number, causing problems every time I tried to log in.  This left me no option but to call the customer service line, who were unable to help me on the numerous occasions when I called to discuss the problem.  I am not so unreasonable as I don't understand that problems occur, however I found o2's response (or lack thereof) very disappointing, especially because I had previously been very happy with my o2 tariff.  However a good tariff isn't everything, the customer support needs to be good too. I have now moved my custom to Vodafone, who have been much easier to deal with (so far) - As an (almost comical) post-script to the entire business, o2 then erroneously deducted a further, dd payment after my last bill date; they have since apologised and refunded but it certainly didn't improve my opinion of them.",1
"At first I gave it 1 star, though it is what it is. Which is a simple app. Nothing great and nothing awful.",1
"PAYG mobile ... cannot log in and they cannot find my number even though I use it regularly, 3 weeks ago I needed a separate mobile broadband sim while changing broadband suppliers, set up account and log in a week later to check my usage not a problem, 3 weeks later tried to log in again and they cannot find my broadband number so I cannot access my account and they cannot find my e mail address yet they are sending me e mails quoting last 4 digits of my broadband number, absolute mess and pointless trying to phone as no one answering, should have stuck with EEOriginal review was 1 star however having failed get in touch with anyone on the phone I filled in a complaint form and the matter was sorted within 24 hours so fair is fair and I have upgraded the review to 3 stars as the matter was sorted, I haven’t made it 5 stars as the problem should never have happened in the first place and there was no explanation or apology for the problems caused. Perhaps they should also open up an e mail help line for non urgent matters and save people hanging on an unanswered phone line. Just a thought.",1
"I'm not sure there's much to choose between mobile phone businesses. For every bad experience, there's a good 'un, snuck away somewhere...or maybe people only moan these days. My phone deal was up and not gonna' lie, I hate when that happens. A morass of offers and sheer confusion, lies ahead. Got a phone deal from BuyMobiles (they were easy to deal with and the phone arrived next day). However, I needed to tidy up the old O2 deal and retain the number. Step up Kirsty Fairbrother! A voice on the phone, from sunny St Helens. Super efficient, super friendly and nothing a problem. Explained, sorted...bish, bash and most certainly, bosh. 5 stars for Kirsty. So why 3 stars overall? That's just for O2. Crap upgrade offer. Live chat only, as outside our 'normal hours', I'd be dealing with someone (nice as they are) in Manila, or some such and a website that seems to be unreachable, on more occasions than should be the case, for a tech business. Well, I have my phone, I have a great deal and I had a Kirsty on my side...everyone should have a Kirsty on their side...",1
"Signal is awful, monthly contract prices are criminal but they're the best of a bad bunch.",1
I often loose signals on O2. I previously used Vodafone and never experienced any problems. Its not that bad but not that good either.,1
"I was with O2 for almost five years, and I was very reluctant to leave. I wanted to upgrade my phone to the HTC Sensation at the end of my contract, but the offer online was much more expensive than offers I had found elsewhere so I gave them a ring.The lady who I spoke to was really unhelpful, and told me that they wouldn't be selling the sensation for long as it was an old model (which is rubbish), and offered me an even older model stating that this would match the price of the offers I had found!Eventually after speaking to about 4 different people, all of whom give me various rubbish answers and not one of them tried to keep me as a customer, I decided to leave. It then took me another 3 phone calls to get my MAC code....!Shame about the above because prior to that I'd always sung their praises! I'd also like to think that it was a one off, but my Mum left them about 3 weeks later and had exactly the same problems!!Get your act together o2 - repeat customers are the way forward!",1
Good service but I ordered an Adroid Ace and it said on the O2 website I could get BBC iPlayer which was actually incorrect.,1
"My review is neutral as there are some good and bad points.I find my O2 signal decent compared with other contracts with THREE and Vodafone. I usually get to chat to someone quite quickly (prior to this Covid19 emergency) and they can mainly solve my issue.I recently upgraded and noticed that a free amazon prime/Disney+ etc was available for free. I upgraded and didn't receive any correspondence. I contacted them to be told that the freebie wasn't available on the tariff I have purchased. As I have other contracts with other providers, I opted for the lowest tariff of unlimited calls and 1gb of data. The phones cost was broken down over the monthly duration then £19 is added for this 1gb tariff. I didn't think too much about it until a month later then have a big advertising campaign promoting SIM only with 50gb of data for £20.O2 claim you only pay the actual handset price but the tariffs are extortionate compared to a plan without a phone. To me, a plan should cost the same regardless of the phone element then the phone is added at the true cost O2 want to charge instead of hiding it behind inflated tarrifs.",1
Good customer service just never take out O2 insurance hard to find there number and impossible to make a claim,1
"Update: 17/08/23, they put my line back in service during the pandemic when I had no phone line. It wasn't kind. They offer a good service, which seems to have improved gradually. 03/01/2021 Poor service; they cut my line during the lockdown, and I had no phone left in case of a life emergency",1
Helpful advice from O2 shop in seeking mobile phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history.,1
"O2 refresh good, allowed to upgraded 13 months early for free however very poor speeds in my area",1
The contracts are decent and signal is good. The customer service is not reachable though!,1
The signal in my area isn't brilliant although my bill isn't too bad.,1
"Far too quick to get you as a customer, very little service afterwards...",1
Can't wait for my mobile contract to end so I can change supplier,1
not getting the coverage i would like in some areas of hampshire,1
"Why can't it be set up that I get informed/warned if I am about to use a service that I will incur extra charges on my bill?I have just come back from Orlando and have been charged every day I was there. I knew I would be charged for some of the days as we were away from the hotel but I used the internet at the hotel on the days we were there. I had the UBER app so we could arrange for taxis wherever we were, but these have worked out more expensive than the I-RIDE now because of my charges from O2. If I had been paying for my 12 year old daughters phone I would have incurred the charges for this too and that wouldn't have been her fault.My children know when in the UK that if they say there will be a charge for something (I.E.Game or tune download) then they are not to continue. Surely if they can warn you of this then they can warn you if you are subject to be charched if you continue with a certain service abroad. Luckily my 18 year old son has juat put his phone in his own name as I had paid for it for the last 3 years.If any of my children were on my contract and had incurred these charges without being warned I would have refused to pay them and taken it to court. This needs to be addressed so that we can make the choice to continue with or avoid the charges...??I have been with O2 for approx 6 years or more and have always found them good but this recent experience will have me checking out their competitors on my next renewal unless they change it.Originally would have got 4 stars possibly even 5 until this recent rip off scam.!!",1
"Coverages OK, but customer service center could be better.",1
Good network but poor signal in the Birmingham area,1
"This has to be the most frustrating, confusing, overcomplicated and inefficient website I have ever experienced. Every month it's a fight to actually view the bill. When you 'sign in' it constantly kicks you to generic pages about what they do or what you can buy or changing your details, it's a labyrinthine pot luck to view what 'your o2' is actually doing. Eg, viewing a bill or attempting to top up or even attempting to buy anything you've seen on the page before?..... I'm just going to say GOOD LUCK!! The very few times I have ever managed it is by clicking the link on the billing email the very first time I've opened it and that has still usually taken several attempts. Trying to contact them is pointless, I have done so via their 'contact us' link on several occasions and had generic 'click view my bill' etc instructions (like that's not what I'd done in the first place!???) for the first couple of times then absolutely NOTHING! And, before you wonder, I have never been rude or abusive I've just said I've tried that but it's not working can you help further? The people in the shop are lovely but they seem to struggle getting the site to do anything as well! Ironically, the poor site must confuse itself because if I see another 'sorry, we are dead busy, please try later' message I will scream. Luckily I'm ultimately not that fussed as long as I can text, call and receive calls. If I was a serious mobile phone user I would be straight onto switch sites! God knows who they employed to design their website but I would ask for my money back if it was me!!! Blimey!!!!!!......6th April 2023: they have obviously had a massive overhaul. My experience of direct customer service in 2019 was excellent and their access to bills etc is now not a problem so credit where credit is due! Hence 3 stars now instead of one",1
"New phone from O2 using old mobile number.There are are 3 phases to my last experience with O21) The sales transaction went through very smoothly and I received the phone on time as stated. One minor issue with not sending me the new format Micro Sim card, but sent me a free Pay-As-You-Go sim card.2) Upon receipt, called O2 and reported the missing sim card, and that I need my old number managed by O2 to work with the new phone etc. At the time I was still using my 4 year old mobile phone. The assistant took my details, phone details, details of the Pay-as you go sim card and even details of my old phone's sim card.The O2 assistant then went ahead and logged the details and made some changes. Note that my old number is purely used for business support and the account with O2 is also a business account.The following day by sheer coincidence one of the walked in customer informed me that my phone number seems to be cut off!!!!  Only then I realised what the O2's operator had done to my 23 year old business phone number. She changed my old number with the Pay-as-you-go number so my old phone now only works with the PAYG number!!!3) Furiously called O2, a very calm operator took the details investigated what was done and apologetically managed to undo what was done, it did take about an hour before I get my old phone number back and also he arranged for a new sim card to be sent, so the new phone with the new sim card and the old number eventually worked together.In terms of marking:1) Phase-1:       4*       would have been 5 if I had received the Sim card.2) Phase-2:       0*       I am being too generous here3) Phase-3        5*       For fixing the problem so promptly.",1
"Have bought new phone from 02 for my 02 service only contract. What a farce. Had to buy it via taking out other contract and then paying it off. Lad in shop was very precise about what I needed to do and even gave me script. I followed it to the letter luckily and noted down time, name of operative and transaction number. A month later they charged me £600 for not using the contract. I phoned twice to try and get them to repay the amount and eventually had to get my bank to take the money back. Then they took it out again the next month because nobody it seems had made a note of the repayment. I've just had a third call. No manager in the office to speak to. They acknowledge I don't owe them the money but just don't seem to be able to get it together to stop taking it. Have been with them years because their coverage is good but this side of the business is totally chaotic, very badly organised and frankly leaves you feeling they couldn't give a damn.Update: On my bill for December it appears this problem is finally sorted. It took four telephone calls, an email and a visit back to the O2 shop where I bought the phone. One of the problems seems to be their billing service is automated and carries on sending out bills even when they adjust the amount in the account. A second problem is the telephone operatives are not authorised to adjust bills above a certain amount so they have to contact another department to authorise that and a third problem is that the supervisors are not numerous enough to deal with the volume of complaints so are not available to deal with you at the point of contact. To be fair, the humans I came in contact with were uniformly courteous. It appears to be the systems which require a radical rethink.",1
The best service provider but the prices very high.,1
"New contract with slow 4G and 3G speeds.I took out a new contract with the OnePlus 5T handset and had come from the EE network. The O2 network was very slow for 4G and 3G speeds. After I had contacted their customer services, they were unable to tell me why I was receiving slow speeds (2-10mbps) on 4G. I couldn't even load the Google Homepage, I might as well have had an old Nokia as the only thing my handset could do was make and receive phone calls.They allowed me to do one of the following;Send the handset back to them and pay for one months' airtime, ending my contractorPay the handset value off, which then can be unlocked for free and used on another network.I opted for the latter, paid £438, and they unlocked my handset and ended my contract without penalty. I have switched back to EE, and back to the normal 50-60mbps 4G speeds.Their customer service team, particularly the technical support team aren't very good they told me that their phone masts were working correctly and that the network might be ""busy"" and when I complained regarding the slow speeds they made no effort to retain me as a customer and the retentions team processed my cancelation within minutes. Maybe they are aware of the slow speeds?To me, 4G speeds should be at a minimum of 30mbps, and just like home broadband packages now they should be regulated with a minimum guaranteed speed at your home address. I was lucky in this instance that O2 allow you to pay off your device and leave, but if it was over the 14 day cooling off period and I was with another provider then I would have been stuck in a 24 month contract with slow speeds. Hats off to O2 for resolving my issue and allowing me to leave my contract, I would return as a customer if they sort out the speed of their 4G services.",1
"I don't know where to start. We've seen the worst possible customer service with over 8 hours on the phone to O2 in more than 30 calls. Please read this is you ever have problems reactivating your phone after reporting lost temporarily to O2.  They couldn't reverse the blocks they put on our phones.  It ended well in the end with 2 new phones provided free of charge - which is why the 3 star rating.- Loss of phone for a few hours result in device blacklisted.- Phone found shortly after. After 8 days and 8 hours of calls O2 still couldn't reverse what they had done to the phone even after removing the blacklist. As a result no signal, calls, imessage etc... the phone could only be used on WIFI.- To make worse O2 asked the sim to be put in someone else's phone to see if it worked. Doing this blacklisted their phone too and again when O2 reversed the process their Iphone was left unusable except via WIFI. Their phone was not on O2.- After much wrangling and refusals, O2 replaced the O2 contract handset with a new one via next day delivery but denied any responsibility for the £1,100 + non O2 Iphone 12 Pro they had made unusable. Attempts were made to blame Apple and the carrier the phone was actually on.- We logged all calls (time, date, content etc..) ready to go to small claims court or ombudsman. The formal complaint process was initiated via email. An email was sent to the CEO (and a response from his team received within 24 hours), social media used and info sent a newspaper consumer champion.- Finally on the evening of 31st Jan we received a call from someone senior, professional and clued-up who wanted to help. After sending screen shots directly whilst on the call via email to them, a new un-locked Iphone 12 Pro at zero cost was promised via next day delivery.  The old phone will be returned in due course as part of the process.This non-O2 new replacement phone has just arrived as promised and with my old sim card I finally have a signal and working phone back. Thank you to who eventually sorted it out.",1
"I decided to move from SIM-ONLY to o2 Refresh, because o2 was doing a buy 30GB for the price of 10GB deal.Speaking to the agent was great. She was very helpful, polite and sorted out my package quickly.Rather than have it sent via post, I decided to collect from my local store in WEMBLEY CENTRAL.After carefully reading the instructions on the email, I went to the shop with Order number and the Debit card used to make the transaction.Once I got there, I showed my Order number, then was asked for my Debit card. I was asked a few security questions, then I was asked to supply photo ID.At this point I informed them that the email from o2 said NOTHING about photo ID. I brought what I was asked to bring in the EMAIL. The AGENT who sold me the phone also told me to bring these things and nothing else.I was then told there was nothing they could do and I would have to go get photo ID.I had a friendly back and forth with them, informing them that their shop and o2 need to get on the same page. o2 is telling me one thing...... You guys are telling me something else.I also informed the GUY that I was dealing with there, that I also have experience dealing in Customer Service, and this isnt the correct way to handle this situation.HIS response was, ""Well if you have experience in Customer Service, YOU should know better""......... LOL ........At this moment, I fully understood why O2 has such Low ratings.I went home, got my ID and brought up my email on the phone. Showed it to the staff and asked them to read it out to me. They quickly realised they were wrong and apologised....... BUT... damage was already done.They explained that their store is a Franchise etc etc etc, thats why they are more strict with security...... not sure why a customer needs to know thisIn the end, I dont fault them to much. O2 need to train their staff.But they also need to recognise that these kids represent their company and brand",1
PASYG cheap but coverage only fair,1
"A mixed customer experience made at last satisfactory.A few years back, I took out a dongle mobile broadband account with O2 which I used infrequently to use during outside broadcasts for a Gospel Radio Station.Last November 2017, I asked O2 to discontinue this as I was personally paying for as a gift to the charity and use had dwindled down to 0 use.I was assured by helpful phone staff that this would go through in the next few days and to ignore any bills.  The account was to have been put on a PAYG basis.  A bill came in December then January.  I followed this up.  The helpful staff assured me there had been an issue and applied credit to cover the bill. Good...Then a bill for £.00 came in February.  My THought - What are O2 doing wasting money of course the account is cleared and PAYG.A bill of disconnection came in March for £19.08.  What?  How can you have £0.00 one month then £19.08 the next?  What are O2 playing at? A call to the friendly apologetic Samantha reulted in no answers as she could not get into the system with the info I had given.  She suggested I try an 02 store with the device.I did so today but the staff there were unable to directly help short of giving me a phone to call. The helpful Jen offered to sit with me while I called and she did until I was able to speak to someone.   38min and 6 seconds later - I think a result.Most of the time was spent waiting while David and his colleague did their best to clarify the situation then arrange to apply a credit to cover the full cost of charges up to 10 March.It is a mark of a very good company to admit when they are wrong.  This David and his colleagues have done and have tried to make good.  Hats off to the individuals in O2 who try to make good. They should be appauded.It is a mark of a very poor company when the accounting system lets its employees down and does not apply the changes customers ask for and are promised and sends wasteful, spurious bills.  If I am annoyed and inconvenienced think of the effect on those less able to pay their bills and those vulnerable.If O2 truly have made good and short of the final statement, I do not receive another bill, all well and good.  If not, watch this space.  I won't hold my breath.",1
Solid but evil on pricing,1
Ripped me off,1
never used,1
Been with O2 for 7-8 years and I can say they have fallen from grace there signal quality is very poor cant get reception in my own home now when once they where the only company that could and the prices of contracts compared to what you get is terrible my girlfriend changed hers when she got an iPhone and they told her she want this contract then cos her old one was to much she then run up a £60 just a scam to get her of her old decent contract.,1
"I walked out of my local O2 shop when they said quote ""yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like (4S)""....so I went to Vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones..so went back to 02. No joy, no price match not even for a long term customer with 4 phones in the family...so went back to Vodaphone. They suggested I called O2 retention !!!!!! I did - they did a great deal...BUT. When the new 4S stops working the customer service refer you to an O2 shop - who will have nothing to do with you. As neither will Apple. Buying from 'retention' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with O2 retail shops.  Poor service, wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone. Only saving grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 3 hrs and 5 calls waiting on piped music landlines.",1
"Edit: Dropped to three stars as I dropped O2 when their signal in my town went through the floor after some 'consolidation' of masts.O2 aren't perfect, no telecoms provider is, but after dealing with all of the 'big 4' top tier mobile telecoms companies at one time or another O2 comes out on top by a long chalk in terms of the coverage they provide (both 2G and 3G), the value of their products and contracts, and the customer service they provide when needed.They could certainly improve in all three areas, and particularly in customer service, but I would rate them as 'acceptable' or higher in all three areas, something I couldn't say for Vodafone, Orange / T-Mobile, or 3 and certainly wouldn't say for ANY of the 'virtual' providers such as Virgin / Tesco etc.",1
"have been an o2 customer for the last 4 years before that I was T-Mobile, changed whe I was assured that the reception would be much better than with T-Mobile, when?",1
"02 seem to faver the pay as u go customers over the contract customers,  (ie) free this free that but if your on contract zilch.",1
"Good, but i'm jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment",1
Caravanning round the UK I was looking for a network that supported iPhone & gave good service. O2 has done this though I am surprised with the various 'blackspots' in coverage in Scotland & middle England compared to my wife who's phone is Orange. Quality/depth of service is certainly better than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than I,1
"always good service from customer service department, website really hard to use when trying to add/remove contact details on family bolt on - so would say website needs looking at by IT department. only let down is when someone at customer services say they'll call you back then don't",1
"I have been an O2 client since the first iPhone was released in the UK. The staff have always been particularly helpful (both in stores and on the phone) but a few things are lacking and haven't been improved during the time I have been a client with them:1. Mobile coverage is very poor in the outskirts of city centres, especially in the North.2. Very little offers for long-term customers, nothing exciting from keeping me on changing provider (in fact I will do so by the end of July).3. Some shops do not display real handsets! Is this a joke? How do I know if I like a particular phone when the only thing you see is a cheap plastic replica? **unfortunately this is a problem with other providers as well.",1
"Currently have personal 02 phone, which drops the 3g signal and makes it difficult to surf on the move. Work location has poor reception so personal mobile is pointless during most of the working week",1
I've never had a problem with the customer service side of o2 but find the reception to be very hit or miss.  Seems to be worse now I have an iphone.,1
all the companies need to start valuing their customers and not overcharging wherever they can,1
"Due to some market strategy, O2 have decided to push the new HTC HD7. At my last upgrade I had wanted an HTC Desire HD but, as usual, in their wisdom they decided not to stock it. Unfortunately I'm at the mercy of poor signal coverage so I'm stuck with them. Hopefully the other providers will have my area coverage sorted by the time my next upgrade is due because I'm definitely jumping ship. I've already got a rather expensive plan but for some reason I have never actually paid that amount on my bill. It is, without exception, always more expensive even though my phone usage is quite low!",1
many hidden charges and always charges over my monthly bill,1
see above as this summarises everything,1
keeps it simple,1
"Good signal coverage, calls rarely dropout. Tariffs are competitive too.Like many services, all is well until you need to actually speak to someone. The ""hold"" time for customer services is generally 5-10 mins and the individual at the other end of the phone can be hit or miss.I queued for 1hr 22mins last month to get through to the complaints dept only to be greeted immediately with ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"" - not ""Hello"", not ""Sorry to the delay"".When i asked if there was no way i could have been informed (i.e. recorded message or similar) without having to hold for almost an hour and a half she merely repeated ""were having IT problems, please call back tomorrow"". Possibly the rudest anyone has ever been to me over the phone.I am still with o2 - only because I cant be bothered to ring back to cancel my contract.",1
I was a O2 customer for years but have just changed to Vodaphone. O2 do have excellent customer service and a easy to use website but the iphone coverage is very poor.I was also disappointed with the deals on offer compared to rivals.,1
I do not know what it is that you are gold or silver customer but they think they can con and trick on that talk. Want to upgrade now and they will have to do it if they have some system issues.Apart from that I am satisfied customer.,1
"your CS is good, insurance is diabolical,",1
Most Networks are saturate in the London area-but O2 still works very strong.But 3G on O2 is extremly slow while moving in a train or driving,1
"I was with o2 for some years, but the network seems to have become really unreliable for me. The 3G coverage is patchy and inconsistent, and dropped calls became the norm. A pity because if they could just sort the infrastructure I would still be with them today. I get the feeling they didn't invest in the backbone of the network quite as much as they ought. Customer services are excellent though and couldn't be more helpful. Maybe I'll return in the future when the network issues have been addressed.",1
Also a reasonable help line,1
"biggest problem loyal customers who want to stay, but get priced out you only get a deal when you cancel or are a new customer??",1
I find that o2 has the best mobile signal around the country. their customer service and tarriffs are not the best though,1
"...a bit sketchy in Woodingdean, Brighton though.",1
A good network however the coverage isnt always great. But all the tariffs are good on pay and go simplicity and unlimited,1
An average service. Had a major complaint when they made a mistake with a contract renewal date but it was handled well and the compensation given was fair.Customer service is average.,1
had to wait ages for a refund,1
"Good choice of business phones, though tends to be pricey.  Initial marketing suggested that I would be contacted if service was an over-provision: no such contact occurred.  When my phone needed repair, it was astonishingly expensive, and my queries about why were ignored.I won't be going back to O2 at the end of my contract.",1
"MY ORDER WAS PLACED ON THE 15TH OF DEC AND I PAID 5,88 FOR POSTAGE AND NOT RECIVED MY PRODUCT JUST HOPE ITS HERE FOR XMAS",1
"o2 fine, i'm not happy that i cant sign up for 12 months,it seem's to be the same with most server's these day's which i thing is wrong,we should have more choice with these contracts,R C",1
Generally good coverage which is what really matters to me.  However this seems to have deteriorated since I first started on this network a few years back,1
I generally get good coverage from 02 and have no complaints although the calls when overseas still seem excessive.,1
Unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers...,1
"the only problem ive had with o2 , isnt really an issue with service , my problem was the choice of so called upgrade after i renewed my contract , i gave up my N958gb which was a fantastic phone , and upgraded? to the nokia 5800 xpressmusic which isnt a great phone but was the only remotely decent phone that i could get for free, i did take 18month contract at £30 a month and im really disapointed because i could have got a much better phone for that level of tarrif from any of the other network providors ,so as much as i like the service provided , i will be lookin at the other providers first then maybe try nokia",1
"Everytime I upgrade I seems to get a lower value deal, it would be nice if o2 concidered the value of loyalty as much as it does new new business.",1
Ok overall but the tarrif for iphones seem a bit high.,1
"They always manage to replace damaged phones quickly. Would get 5 stars if they could change my tariff without screwing up every time.Update - dropped my rating by 1 star to 3 stars. They've always allowed me to upgrade cheaply 1 year into a 2 year contract provided I agreed to another 2 years. Option gone now - £100+ per phone. Guess I'll sit out the next 12 months, then look at my options elsewhere.Edit - June 2012Another 2 stars dropped - their 3G service is just too poor. I've bought a PAYG dongle from Three - 5 bars at home of 3G, even worked while on holiday in Orkney. My contract is up later this year, so I'll be switching to Three.Update October 2013 - OK, I'll put them back up to 3 stars! We're on O2 Business,  and the customer service is excellent. Just wish the network coverage was as good!After upgrading our email server, we've had problems with the Blackberry server. No problem for them to change the tariff. New phone (Nokia 520)  for just £59+VAT.Assuming they finally get TUGO working on Business tariffs, we might even stay with them when the contract expires!",1
I can't complain about the coverage but the customer service at o2 especially for business customers is appalling,1
Improvements could  be made when responding to complaints via email -,1
I only use the phone for work. if i use the phone more than once a week i'am on a good thing.I can't see why you have to top up by £10.00 all the time. Nothing worse than lossing a phone with lots of money on it.,1
Like coverage,1
hard to get VAT    invoices,1
"Love my Iphone.  But dont love that although I aready pay for a data pack, they are charging me for an Iphone data pack as well!",1
"fairly good reception, I don't know how to log on to check bill they don't make it very clear.",1
"I have never experienced any problems as a  low user wih O2.Perhaps I am lucky,but I always get a good signal with good sound quality.",1
"Good reliable phone service, however the longer you've been with them the less perks you get until there's no difference between them and others...",1
"I have been with o2 for a number of years, around about 10 I would say. I am on a very low monthly tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone. They offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets. When, and usually before the contract expires, a free upgrade is offered. Both the o2 store and o2 online have very good deals with extremely competitive prices.Their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price, with the cheapest line installation around. However, one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing customers, they no longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no longer benefiting their existing customers, who may now decide to leave.",1
"i have used o2 all my life and only recently experienced problems, i plan on changing to vodafone soon",1
"Overpriced but good customer service, if you need it.",1
"I thought the way that o2 handled the whole upgrade for this latest iPhone was pathetic. They kept me waiting for over 3 1/2 hrs in the rain with no updates about stock etc. It then turned out there was none left and no one in any of the shops in Glasgow, in particular theo r I q at the fort were the worst. They treated the customers like a piece of sh&t, treating them with utter contempt. The amount of custom o2 lost out to that day should be noted, around 40 plus people walked away disgusted. It's the first and the last time l ever q for a phone. Current iphone customers who have fed o2's profits for 18mths at over £50 a month should have had the priority of first refusal on the new phone, that would have been the decent thing to do. Everyone who was an o2 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon, now that they want an iphone. It was just a cheap marketing ploy to feed o2's pathetic ego, keeping ppl hanging about with false hopes.",1
"Overall the o2 experience is good, billing and customer helpwise I have no complaints, the 3G network needs improvement and further enhancement.In addition I think the 3G Network growth has come to a standstill as o2 applied for planning permission to upgrade their transmitter not 100 yards from my house over 12 months ago and they were granted permission but still have to do the upgrade, let just hope they do it within the life of the planning permission.",1
Good Service. But not satisfied with the billing system. Sometimes comes more sometimes less??????,1
"I was and am extremely happy at the extra care o2 put into customer services. However its disappointing that the good customer service is funded by my roaming charges. 4 days in Majorca, £230 phone bill? I even switched data off when i wasn't checking my 2kb emails. Not sure where I went wrong. What upset me more was the fact that the network i was using was 'Movistar'.. a Telefonica company (o2's owners). Disappointing o2!",1
"Dropped calls, rubbish 3G coverage.",1
The handsets avaliable to those that have had contracts with O2 are not that good you have better deals if you leave your contract and then get a new one.... No incentitive to stay with o2,1
"I have been with O2 since they were Cellnet. I recently wanted to downgrade my tarrif as I was paying far too much for for the minutes and texts that I actually use. They stated that I could not reduce my taffif until my contract was up. They did however say that I could increse my tarrif... They are quite happy to get more money, but won't give any back. I think it's time for a fresh network come December!",1
brilliant service. The staff always happy to help. The customer contact center is better than the instore service ant day. The service in the Blackpool store is not as good as Preston - St georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped.,1
