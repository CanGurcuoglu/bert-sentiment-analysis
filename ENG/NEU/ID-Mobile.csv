"Service in the UK is OK. But roaming abroad is a nightmare. Bought a data upgrade plan for use while travelling in the US but never worked once while I was there. Followed all the instructions for setting up your phone properly, including going through all the id mobile help forums and adjusting esoteric settings. But other users report exactly same problem with roaming outside the EU. Will be going back to a big provider at end of contract.",1
My number didn't seem to transfer over properly even though I used the switching service. The new number was displayed when I sent text messages instead of my old one. I didn't get missed call notification when people tried to ring me. I had problems for the first month which hopefully have  now been sorted out. It would have been really good to have been able to take my phone to someone to help me instead of things been done online.,1
The billing is not easy to understand My plan is supposedly £8 month but typically higher as I do use add ins but they are not explained,1
"What I like: buying from ID was easy and effortless, good communication too. Everything looks good, but! Probably it's the Three network, but rather often I have no internet access even when the phone shows 4G and 3 bars out of 4. It just doesn't work... Annoying, far worse than EE what I had before.",1
"The operator, while polite and friendly my issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. My subsequent billing was not very well explained and promises made by the sales team were not kept.",1
"The monthly contract fee is decent, unfortunately the internet connection/coverage is very poor. With the previous provider I had 5G very often, but here I haven't encountered it yet.",1
"Generally Ok but they will change your monthly costs in the middle of your contract.. what seemed like a good offer initially is merely Okay.What goods a contract if they can just change it at will?Everyone's living costs have increased, how about I renegotiate with you a little less? Is that fair too?Additionally they will continue to charge you full price for your handset even after it's paid off (24months)",1
I'm generally happy with ID service but there is one annoying issue which is very frustriting. Basically being recently in Central London and Manchester my mobile internet just did not work at all despite having full 5G signal recepton. I am guessing this is because of the fact my ID sim's bandwidth is reduced to near zero in very congested areas. I want to highlight this is purely network issue as my wife and daughter (also on ID network) experience was exactly the same. This is an area you need to improve big time.,1
Very poor internet. Although you get 5G sign on the phone but internet speed is rubbish on so many areas in London,1
"ID as a company I have nothing but praise for, cheap, great app, great online backup.I've been with them for years.Sadly though it's the now pretty appalling ""3"" network they run their services on. And it is so awful now I've had to leave ID.I live in a decent sized town and there's is now zero signal pretty much everywhere within it, and I can't get any signal in my house at all. It's got slowly worse and worse over the last couple of years. Yet despite repeated complaints, ID can't seem to get 3 to do anything, and 3 dont even bother respond when approached directly.So it's a thumbs up to ID, but do check 3's dubious network before you commit!",1
"Sometimes,signal is suddenly out of order, even the phone call, and it happened so many times. I have to restart again and wait for few minutes.",1
"I disliked the fact that iD list 50 countries that are covered in their roaming packages, only to find out after getting on board, that Italy is not one of the countries covered…… Potentially, I will now have to pay more on top of my monthly tariff ! Also, I notice that there appears to be no facility to add funds to use premium numbers, like “61054” which is a Greatest Hits Radio Premium SMS number. Any chance either of the above will change soon ?",1
Great service in terms of delivery. Good app and prompt delivery of new handset plus returns envelope for old handset. Unfortunately I’m still yet to receive the payment for my old handset. 2 emails but no reply!,1
Price of plans are very good however signal coverage lacks in a lot of areas especially for data even checking the coverage before ordering,1
"Never got 5g connectivity in the same device which I was using, while I was with three UK. Even 4g speed is not that great. Thinking of changing ID soon. Even in central London internet speed is too slow, than think outside London area. Also no call centre where you can get any help, everything online or a chat bot. Using ID SIM from last 45 days and not so impressed.",1
Very hard to get a costumer addvicer at them end of my contract I will change to a different net work,1
"Generally happy with the cost and reliability while I am out and about, but unfortunately I am unable to get a signal while I am at home. I did check before switching to you to ensure I should be able to get a signal at home but there is clearly a problem. My post code is HR9 5UF",1
I am unable to access my accout updates on my phone,1
"Great price but patchy network.I know they use Three’s network, so it’s not specifically their fault, but I regularly go through black spots and places where you only get 3G coverage - which is prettt useless these days.Thought it was a result of living in north Nottinghamshire, but had the same issues on the M1 near Daventry today.Good access along the country’s main motorways should be a given.",1
The service were I live is rubbish even though on the checker it said it was okI use the wifi calling when at home as the phone signal is rubbishEven in London it's a bit hit and missI made a mistake moving to this I'd and I'm stuck with it for the next 23 months,1
"I feel the price of contracts are reasonable but I tried to open 3 contracts for me , my wife and my child and they wouldn't let me due to some crazy policy and I was only aloud to open 2 which was one of the points I was swapping providers",1
Signal is patchy in some built up areas. Other networks have better signal in south Banbury,1
"Decent enough network, but not outstanding.Technical issue from 2022 still hasn't been resolved two years later: namely, can't receive SMS while roaming from non-UK numbers. Works on Three but not on iD Mobile.Cancelling your contract is laborious and talking to robots and chat agents to achieve, which is ridiculous in 2024.",1
Whilst the phone package I currently use is competitive - my ability to connect to family etc over the last 3-4 weeks has been disgraceful. At time I have been able to contact people inc husband who was sitting next to me …I believe ID use the 3 network..Will be looking for a new supplier after Xmas…,1
I am disappointed with the network signal coverage it  is very poor in alot of areas  with signal coming and going regularConstantly  1-2 bars 3 on a good day never seen the  full signal filled.,1
Affordable plansTrouble to signing in my iD Mobile accountResolved now!,1
Good service I just wish that the signal was better noticed it's quite low in most areas that I live.,1
"I’m with ID mobile for more than year, and happy enough. Signal is very average even in city centre of Belfast and text message sometimes last long until is received, long mean a day which happened yesterday and that is obviously not great.",1
"I am elderly and would like to have a customer service that I can speak to….to guide me through where I want to go.  I suppose a chat bit might do ,but not very user friendly.",1
Great deal with phone and sim but very bad reception. Can use phone indoors very often with data switched on have to use WiFi. And very often calls don't go through.,1
I live in a poor reception area and have considered finding better cover. There is nothing more annoying than when your call drops out.Your Web site shows that you cover my area. Sadly only poorly.,1
The lack of being able to contact someone at ID Mobile from the website is not good. There is information available on the website but it's a pain having to find it especially if the subject is not covered by any of the FAQ's and most of the stuff written by the 'ID' community does not interest me. It would be so much easier if you could email someone even with a short character limited message,1
At home I have WIFI so no problem but when I am in my caravan in the Malverns the 4g signal is not connecting to my phone my partner on her phone no problem she is with Tesco.,1
sometimes the signal could be better but overall ID offer good value for money and service.  some sort of app feature to identify and feedback poor signal areas would help identify areas for network improvement's to address the poor signal / no signal areas and also improve the coverage map to more closely show actual performance rather than predicted coverage.,1
Was trying to switch both of my EE expired contracts to id but there was issues activating simThen when deleted e sim had issues getting replacement as one was sent for wring nr and other not sent at all so had to pick up from currys .Overall contacted them on many occasions customer service very robotic and not good .Going to another provider now as first impression wasnt good as well as the signal.,1
I dislike the fact a new customer can get a better deal than existing customers  there was an I phone se 3rd generation for £19.99 a month which i took out and couldn’t keep my number if I got upgraded it was £22.99 for same phone with less data,1
I can never get an assistant at my local Currys when I go in. Your staff in the past have been very helpful but it's really hard to get a member of staff now.  As a pensioner I am not technically on the ball so find it very frustrating.,1
"Changed to ID as existing supplier was increasing cost for less , kept same number and the change over was faultless. Joined ID as received email saying 5 g available in my area and coverage map showed it was , problem is its not , on 1 bar on 4 G and download speed of 1. 5 MBS at most , the roll over data is pointless as not fast enough service to use the monthly allowance never mind roll over . It however seems that miss information regarding service availability is not grounds to cancel contact so stuck in a 12 months con which is all but useless . Customer se work from a script so totally un pre to deal with most cases. As seems to be the norm , any company that has communication as its core also seems to have Communication missing from its customer service.",1
Having notified you in August of my change of address I was disappointed to receive (eventually) your letter dated December—I have sent you a paper reply and instructionsYou were not the only people to ignore my change of address!!Juliet R,1
"I needed to change my plan to suit a new phone, but it just won't let me change. It is tolerable with the plan I already had, but I'm seriously considering going elsewhere. The process of selecting a new plan is absurdly complex. Given idmobile's reply about lengths of contract (why is it always something the customer has done wrong) I should have pointed out that I have been five years with idmobile, a contract has ended, and what I was trying to do was set up a new plan. I just kept going round in circles getting nowhere, their help bot didn't cover my issue, and their help line was hopelessly hard to reach, and the one time I got through they gave me advice irrelevant to my problem.",1
Poor signal at times in areas where I always had full signal,1
"Data coverage is terrible—it's nowhere near as good as O2, but you get what you pay for, I suppose. The deal's price bundled with other stuff I got was good, but the 5G signal is shocking. I have to wait until I can buy out the remainder of my contract to move back now, which is very disappointing.",1
Increasing bad coverage even in large urban areas such as London. Downloads on 4G painfully slow. Even when connected to 5G speed is very poor at times,1
"The signal I receive is very mixed at times. Even in a city like Southampton, I received close to no signal at all whilst my partner on another network had full service.",1
"Signal drops out, call fails to complete, people complain that they can't hear us quoting poor sound bad line. I was under there impression we were supposed to be getting 5G before the end of this year and 2 & 3G were closing down, well the last I heard from someone at ID was we have three antennas around us 2 were 2g 1 was 3g when do we get 5g on all our antennas giving us a very good signal not poor to average, in THE DN8 4SZ AREA of Doncaster",1
"I dislike that in busy locations I'm often unable to access the internet via my ID Mobile contract on my iPhone whereas other people not on ID Mobile are happily streaming videos and making Facetime calls. Likewise (and this might be just a quirk of geography) I'm unable to get online at all during about 60% of my commute home, whereas plenty of other passengers on the train can. I occasionally ask what network they're on; it's never ID Mobile. But, ID Mobile is cheap and when it works it's ok, hence 3 stars not lower.",1
Generally happy - good plan and price.However I was sent a notification with someone else’s number on it and could not contact you to notify. Eventually just deleted it. Would prefer a better means of contact to resolve such issues.,1
I find it difficult  sometimes to make calls when I'm out and about coverage is inconsistent or sometimes it will just drop Even at   get either 1 or two bars when other people with me get better reception,1
"I find the coverage is patchy when it comes to Internet connection. I often find I can not connect to the web when out and about in Glasgow, never mind more remote places. Accessing my online account is not always possible either so it's a good thing they allow you to cap your spend as I rarely know how much data I have left.",1
"Good the price and Europe roaming.Bad: a lots of locations no reception, impossible to speak to a person from ID at the time of need. It is not possible to use in North America under any plan.",1
"I have been a customer for the last 8years, last 2 on a sim only deal. Was going to change provider due to bad reception. Applied for pac number, but received a call from your sales, who persuaded me to upgrade to a samsung A16. Phone to big and to heavy, like a brick!!. Trying to return it has been a trial. My local Currys {Telford] would not accept it.Talked to a helpful person via chatbot [Preston].would much rather be speaking to a live person, would have been much quicker and easier.",1
"I changed my package last year from pay monthly to sim only. The option I needed was not available on the web site & couldn't be done by phone because there wasn't a human to talk to. I had to go into a Curry's shop & because they are cutting their staff numbers & the training of those staff to the bone I had problems. I had to go back 3 times before somebody who was plainly overworked, underpaid & therefore didn't enjoy their job helped me out. He was brilliant, I have to say. The phone coverage is a bit spasmodic but funnily enough better away from home than in it!!!!!!",1
Price was good but set up painful. I wanted to transfer 4 family numbers from my Vodafone account but 2 is the maximum ID will allow at a time?!?! My credit rating is good and this was less than £30pm total sim only - what’s the risk?!!  Neither of the two numbers worked on the change over date so both times I had to have a lengthy conversation with the helpline desk. Now that I’m on things are ok though often the phone shows 2 or 3 bars of signal but can’t make calls or receive data.,1
"Firstly, you don’t seem to have an email address.  I recently had a query on my account for 07964907016.  I rang your company and spoke to a lady who was not all that helpful, she kept asking me if I wanted to make a complaint.  I don’t want to make a complaint, but I do have a query on my most recent bill.  I don’t remember making the call on 27 Nov which has cost me about £13.  The lady suggested I look at my “recents”.  I did that and the only call I made was through WhatsApp.  I have a screenshot of that, but without an email address how can I get it to you?",1
"They shouldn't cancel orders with message ""you failed credit check criteria"" for 8 pounds / month - is silly. Maybe is valid in India.They should say: you can create maximum 2 plans under the same account, as a general policy of ID m.",1
"I chose iD Mobile because of the price, which is why I'm giving 3 stars.But the network availability is pretty awful where I live in the west of Northern Ireland. This is despite the iD Mobile website telling me availability should be good / excellent.",1
Don't appear to offer existing customers deals that are as good as those offered to new customers,1
"Coverage always good no matter where I am. Plans are wee bit expensive but not bad. Very difficult to switch plan though and the app is beyond uselss- tou can look but if you want to actually ""do anything"" there is ALWAYS - ""Oops something went wrong please try again in a few seconds""",1
"Early days yet, so far finding id suitable but time will tell.",1
"My husband and myself have both found  the signal very ‘variable’ these days unfortunately-We’ve been with ID for years and up to about a year ago was very happy with it.The ID app is straightforward , and the price is good- but sadly we’ve been thinking of changing provider and will have to pay more but hopefully have a better signal",1
"When using 4G data’s in my area, the reception is poor. Friends on other networks have a better reception than myself. It will probably be the difference next time, when renewal time comes.",1
Can't speak to anyone,1
For the last 6 months I’ve had a problem with my direct debit payment of £6 per month. Every month there has been a problem and I’ve had to pay manually. Even the agent tried to set it up and it failed. It’s frustrating that it’s so hard to speak to someone and that the simple matter of a direct debit seems to be un achievable. Another fail and I’ll find another provider,1
Lack of reception inside shopping malls and intermittent signals at bus stops when checking travel apps.,1
Booked a mistletoe  and martini break at thoresby hall very disappointed no celebration at all no decorations for Xmas.  Evening entertainment poor all we got was as singers every night no comedians or alternative entertainment at all.,1
the signal coverage is awful. I live in the city yet at home and elsewhere locally I sometimes cannot get a signal at all,1
"Bought this sim to travel around Europe with and it was a decent price with good data limits and coverage. If this is where it ended I would probably give id at least a 4 star rating. However, if you ever have a problem with your plan (which I have had many) then dealing with the customer service is a pain. You have to fight to chat to a real person in the online form, and when you get to a real person they are clearly just working from a simple script meaning they are not much better than the robot.To top it off, once I got back from travelling I immediately cancelled my sim using the id mobile app, however a month on and I have received an email saying I have outstanding balance. They have attempted to charge me an extra month after I have cancelled my plan and now I am stuck on customer service again sorting it out.Will not be recommending id to anyone.",1
"The signal coverage is not good, I’d use 3 network, I was with 3 and the coverage was better when with them.There isn’t a customer service team available",1
"Couldn't use my phone because I had allegedly gone over my limits, found this hard to believe when i took out a higher rate of payment a few months ago",1
The mobile connection normally in the mornings is hopeless. For instance when I try to make a phone call it takes several attempts to be connected.,1
"For someone who is not familiar with all the terms  used in mobile tech., websites and bills are not easy to understand.",1
"The price is great and I have a good amount of data.  However, the coverage in my area when it is cloudy means that I am unable to make a phone call.  As I don't have a landline this has sometimes been a problem.  This does mean that I might have to get another provider.",1
Reasonably priced. Coverage seems to be similar to other providers. Renewing or changing your contract is not easy online. They got my billing wrong when I changed and took a n age to get it sorted.,1
I got in touch with id mobile via my chat because I upgraded my id mobile sim to 5g but I wanted to keep my present id mobile number but instead of me keeping my number with id they put me a payg so how do I keep my present number with id mobile?.,1
Signal in my area is low. Intermittent connection unless stay out in the open space. Package is good at the time of taking on but now there are plenty of better deals around.It’s good but not the best.,1
"Trying to set up roaming abroad especially for Ireland impossible. Also when needing to contact you, it is again impossible, why can't we have a real person to talk to that will explain and hopefully resolve your problem",1
"I moved from O2 due to their poor network coverage,  and on the recommendation of my wife who is with you. The price and the move were fine but, despite several attempts, we were not given the £30 ""introduction offer"" promised. Poor effort I'd mobile.",1
I am not able to see on my phone how many minutes I have used on telephone calls. Until the app was changed this information appeared without any problem but it.now is unavailable.,1
Improve  the quality  of your network  i have network  but it keeps cutting in and out,1
Extremely difficult to get on website. Not sure how to sign in as it never recognises my email address,1
Took a long time for my phone to cross over to the  network from my previous provider ended up pay two monthly bills,1
Signal is very poor on this networkSome issues setting it up! I for some reason now have two phone numbers and the support page has not helped (not been able to speak to a real person just yet)Not sure if I regret moving from EE,1
"Chat looks like the only official way of asking and sorting problems.The reply between chat replies takes too much time and I can't stay not stop waiting for an answer from the id operator.What I do is to move out of the web page, with an ear set and listen to the click sound when they reply back. Unfortunately without this trick is almost impossible to reach a solution in the chat.Is a pity, I moved to Id m. due to the service quality. They should fix this quickly.",1
Cheap tariff but coverage is poor at times. We have several phones in the house all using iD sims. Some phones get coverage while others don’t even sitting in the same room of the house.,1
"Signal can go down whilst using phone and internet at the same time,experiencing areas with poor signal on a daily basis",1
"No help line using telephone not very good for older customers, so had to go to find a Curry's store to get help with my account ( very helpful )",1
when I was in Japan I could not use the mobile and when I came back it was still blocked. WHY? I can pay- just deduct it- In UK I have no complaints but if I go abroad I want a proper service!!!,1
Competitive pricing. I guess its what you get when everything is digital these days. Not the greatest customer service when things go wrong because they are almost impossible to contact.,1
There are some hidden costs to my tariff that if I had known would have chosen a different tariff/provider. I am charged for group text messages and the use of emojis in text messages.,1
It is competitively priced.My wife often gets much beter reception accross the uk on EECant freeze account when im notvusing it for months if i travel out of europeCant speak to a customer supportThe free roaming in Europe is great,1
"The ID company is good,it is easy to change contract online and they send the new phone to your address no hassle. The only issue I have is the network is not working very well the signal is not good enough. The phones are great and the price is good but the network lets them down so I won't be renewing my contract next year.",1
"Disappointing over all. Contract price - excellent, handset price - excellent, coverage moderate to poor almost everywhere unless you are roaming in a European country!It is difficult to get a decent mobile signal  most of the time. Typically only one bar and when mobile data is indicated as 4G on the handset the internet simply does not work. When 5G is indicated on the handset (almost nowhere) the internet is like ""lightening"" and internet calling is available, so, the phone actually works like a phone.Cheaper than Vodafone by a country mile, however, I wish I had toughed it out and stuck with Vodafone, no problems with mobile data/phone signal with them. I should have known that anything virtual and piggy-backed off 3 mobile would be a disaster no mater what they say about how good it is!Hopefully, the merger between Vodafone and 3 Mobile will go ahead and things will massively improve - fingers crossed. In the mean time, I would avoid ID mobile unless you only want to use your phone in continental Europe.Once again, disappointing!",1
Your fare EU travel usage if you’re in the Europe for longer than some weeks is unfair. The uk is no longer in the EU why would you need to introduce this policy.,1
"Cheap enough but coverage could be better, have to rely on WiFi calling at home even though I don’t live out in the sticks",1
My only problem with my ID phone provider is not being able to get any network connection when out and about. Everything else is brilliant.,1
"I have been with this company now for three years, Price is definitely good. The only disadvantage is signal is not the best in certain areas",1
"could not receive any phone calls, used web chat to get help the operator was useless and took 50 minutes establishing I was a customer, she could read what I had typed or chose to ignore it and keep asking her standard question, when i finally did get to explain my problem she said its too hard and would refer it to the technical team, they never go back to me. The support at ID is very very poor.",1
"Good value for money and the ID mobile app is user friendly.The mobile signal is not the greatest, 2 bars at best at most times of the day in various locations within Sussex.",1
"Good service until you go to upgrade. New phone, new plan 32.99 as an upgrade. 22.99 as a new customer. No reward for loyalty. Been with them for 6 years but am leaving once my final bill is 1 months rental. There are better deals out there!",1
The overall contract is good value - the mobile roaming among the best in the market.The upgrade process I have been through is ridiculous as there was only one possible SIM-only contract available without going through the palaver of porting off to another carrier and then coming back on a lower price lower Data limit.,1
Very patchy coverage. BT19 where I work is very poor. Friends on other networks always seem to have better signal than I do.No issues with ID other than poor signal.,1
Just visited USA and couldn’t get my phone to work while over there. I don’t like that there isn’t a contact number to speak to a human and everything is online. I don’t find it easy to find answers,1
Signal is bad in many areas,1
"Cheap but coverage not great, customer service is poor as you can't speak to anyone, best deals around for contract phones though.",1
Signal strength changes depending on location. Especially poor in city centre (London) where I spend most of my day working in the office.,1
Customer very good but 4g coverage in my area is poor,1
A good price but the internet is unreliable and at times unable to maintain a video call or even completely unavailable.,1
Signal not great in parts of London or east anglia. No roaming in Switzerland but does allow roaming in the Isle of Man which why I stick with them!,1
Coverage not so good in my area. No apparent upgrade early choice even though I have been sent emails offering upgrades,1
Can not understand why the price has to increase every year in line with inflation?The cost should rise for the consumables part of the contract but not the phone which was sold at a set priceNext PPI claims?,1
The reception for phone calls in the Denny area where I Iive is very poor causing the calls to keep breaking up.,1
"Phone fine, but had problems with account and password some new site adopted",1
Originally set up from catching warehouse in store but can no longer find a face to face shop to assist,1
Often no connection in busy places even though full signal,1
I feel that the iD(Three network) is getting worse in some parts of London.  E.g can’t get signal in London Waterloo station.,1
I got my daughters contract last year and the process and even porting her number was seamless. So I thought I would order myself a sim only contract when my contract ended. The website was a disaster! I couldn’t check out for ages so asked on live chat if I had been accepted because I did not receive an email to confirm! They put me through eventually to a call back! The woman on the call back could not find my Information so went through a new application with me! When the email arrived it was the wrong term 24 months instead of 30 days rolling contract so I did not sign it this happened twice!  3 days later I decided to try again and this time I could check out but still no confirmation. 48 hours later I contacted the live chat to check status (I took a screenshot of order number but it meant nothing to them) as I was going through live chat I finally had an email confirming delivery with my new number so ported my new number using live chat! Which she did and it worked fine! They offered me £5 credit which I took but 2 weeks later and it has not appeared on my account! It’s a good job they are good value but I bet the company is losing money because it’s inconsistent website and the fact that it took me almost a week to buy a SIM card! The value is very good however the point of sales really needs looking at as does the website!,1
"Dislike not being able to do MMS on the contract for the price it’s not very good, would expect it on a simm only cotract",1
Reception not as good as I had. OK but not as good as my last provider.,1
Iv only ever got 1 or 2 signal bars making phone conversations hard to understand,1
"Very bad network in London, it's not possible to use the data in London, sometimes even the phone call don't work",1
Signal is very hit or miss. I ride a motorbike and have to use offline maps most times. Never had this with Vodafone.,1
"Been a customer for a few years, so far experience good, signal not the best in some areas",1
Had a period when I couldn't log in after you switched off the 3g.,1
It’s okay but my coverage is poor compared to Vodafone. Price is half so you get what you pay for.,1
"ID are good at Customer Service, costs and offers however the mobile signal is often weak or non existent  in country areas - which is disappointing .",1
"Good app, easy to use, problem is they use 3 and the signal is bad and that's the most important part.",1
Extremely disappointed that you are still not covering USA and EU especially France and Germany (need it during my business trips)I Get additional costs on my subscription without real explanations.,1
"Service seems to go to non existent during rush hours , rest of the time it seems to work fine",1
What can you say. It’s cheap compared to others but coverage hasn’t been great for me. I’m in Essex so this may be area based.,1
I hate the fact that it is impossible to speak to anyone there in person...the website is often not the solution to issues I've had.,1
My phone reception hasn’t been great since I changed from Three.,1
I’ve choose this score because I didn’t realise you have to pay to send photos with this plan,1
Poor signal in several places including sometimes in my house,1
Good value but multi-device accounts would be good esp. for families or small businesses.,1
"Couldn’t get my billing right when I got an additional phone for my partner,",1
Good value but reception has become unreliable and there is no 2FA for account.,1
The coverage of ID at times can be frustrating,1
I like the ID network. Good value for money and the mobile data roll over is great. However tI have found the new ID app impossible to use. It used to be great. I'd  log in and then it would crash. This happened over and over again so I have stopped using it.,1
Cheap package but areas with poor reception and impossible to update account details,1
I get a very poor signal 1 bar even less in bad weather when staying in our caravan in Wales.,1
I don't always have good signals but other people in my household using different network to me have better signals. The network signals fluctuate.,1
"Cheap - but for a reason, network coverage is pretty poor outside of large towns",1
"iDMobile is good value for money - I think I have a very good deal.  But I have given it three stars because:1. The only way to contact anyone seems to be by chat.  When I had a problem with a direct debit (see below) I wasn't able to talk to anyone: the only telephone number I could find on you web site is for complaints.  So I had to use chat and my experience is that operators mostly seem to answer the question before the last one I asked, or answer a question I never asked.2. I changed the account from which the direct debit is taken.  I entered the details correctly and your web site accepted them.  The first I knew of a problem was when I received a text message telling me that immediate payment was required and that my account had been suspended.  To find out what had happened I had to first pay the monthly amount.  That was challenging because I logged into your website using my laptop, tried to pay and got the very uninformative error message of ""Oops, something went wrong"".  I ended up paying by phone.  I could then ring my bank and found out that iDMobile hadn't set up the direct debit properly - the money had been taken from my account but because the bank hadn't received the necessary notification about the direct debit, it was immediately returned to my account.  I opened a chat window to talk about it with you and for some reason failed the ID checks - I think my PIN didn't validate (and yes, I'm certain I typed it correctly; and I verified it was set to what I thought it was after the chat) so ended up having to submit a photocopy of my passport and utility bill to get your operator to communicate with me. The only saving grace was that this had happened when I was at home so was able to use my computer (which is not reliant on iDMobile) to research and sort things out.  It could have been very awkward had I been abroad.At the very least, given how long I've been a customer (nearly six years), you could have given me a few days warning before suspending the account. And yes, after all that, I did make use of the single telephone number on your site to make a complaint.",1
"Better signalVery rarely get 5G!!4G at best, but very poor signalUsually make wifi callsWill probably drop ID due to this",1
"The 5g works very well. But only the 5g. In areas where there is only 4g showing, the internet either stops working or works at snails pace. This is not the case with 4g in other providors",1
All good except my data appears to be turned off or limited in some way. I can very rarely rely on it when I am,1
"Signal is poor where I work and is a bit of an issue, would change to another supplier but can’t find another that isn’t more expensive so am sticking with it at the moment.",1
"I have two sides with ID mobile. I’ll try to break them both down here as to why this is currently 3 starsPrices - 5* I got ID with carphone warehouse. It is the cheapest deal around. 5G, 500GB per month WITH ROLL OVER? And a brand new iPhone and I’m paying under £35 a month? Prices are very goodCustomer service - no idea. Not tried it. Can’t comment. Would be unfair to do soSignal coverage - 1* - this is seriously the worst mobile coverage I have ever had in my life. I drop calls constantly, I have “5g” and yet I’m waiting on website slower than I would be using 4g sometimes, I can’t connect half the time in half the locations I’m in. Southish of England an hour or so out of London, signal is abysmal. I’ve had a mobile phone since 2003 so been using mobile contracts for 21 years, I’ve travel through Cambodia and Thailand and various other places. ID mobile where I am is THE worst signal I’ve ever experienced. Bar none. It’s crazy. I thought we were all on the same cel masts too?! So I don’t know why it’s SO bad but I went from EE to ID and my signal took a wild hit.So in summary, it works but I’m often getting a much lower quality product in terms of my service BUT I’m paying a very low price for it so I don’t know maybe you get what you pay for?If this improves I’ll update it",1
"Coverage very mixed.  Reasonable cost, but extra for things like multimedia texts",1
Roaming never work abroad,1
"IDF..YOUR PRICES ARE VERY GOOD, ONLY ONE COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU CANT RING FOR ADVICE ON A FREE NUMBER.",1
"Bought refurbished phone which was faulty, replacement phone was sent within 3 days, this one is also faulty but cannot be bothered with the hassle of returning another phone and having to transfer all data, apps etc,Would not recommend this service.",1
Is very hard to get hold of customer service within normal expecting time for a call center,1
Weak signal in comparison to others specially when in towns like London.,1
"Access to internet is patchy. Even at home when others are fine, mine cuts out.",1
"Very good mobile rates, reception sometimes poor.Good app.",1
"Reception can b slow , the signal is often not very good",1
The signal is quite poor in certain areas,1
Pleased with phone.      Needed to see and inspect before purchase.,1
Could do more to inform me of other tariffs.,1
On occasion I can’t get service and 5G or 6G doesn’t help either,1
The signal can be a bit patchy at times but the value for money is great.,1
no reception at waterloo station,1
Mobile phone service around my home and work are not great.,1
"Overall very good, but upgrades for existing customers much more expensive than deals for new customers",1
"Good price, but often get no signal, so can't make a call.",1
I don't always get a good signal when using the phone,1
Its average not great,1
Still waiting for your response for my request,1
Quite often I cant get a signal to make a call,1
"Poor Signal in Croydon and 5g is very rare,",1
"Cheap, but with that very poor signal coverage.",1
Not being able to speak to anyone when you have a problem.,1
No service most time in Bodmin,1
Everything is difficult to do or find out,1
Prices are very competitive but coverage is not brilliant,1
Many places cannot get reception,1
"Need a person to contact, chat bots are not for me.",1
Your connection to the internet is crap.,1
"I love the phone, but the signal is quite bad when out of WiFi",1
Signal is poor.,1
Poor signal,1
Having problem with network signal,1
I have found ID most times OK.,1
Occasionally difficult to use internationally,1
Good value for money,1
non very well,1
"Really good price and app works well. However, if you get into difficulty it’s all a bit of a support nightmare. If I have an issue I don’t want to go through bots and user groups I just want to talk to someone and at ID this in nearly impossible. So, would have been 5 stars but reduced to 3 because of this.",1
"After many years of having a mobile phone, they seems to do so many things, most not needed. The one thing that all mobile phones lack in is good coverage. It’s so frustrating when you are trying to have a conversation with someone and you loose signal! My dearest wish is that companies would concentrate on getting the infrastructure set in place. Then DAB radio would work and mobile phones as well",1
"Customer service and actually getting to speak to someone is very bad when you have a problem, otherwise when all working it's good.",1
Don't like that picture messages are not included in monthly allowance,1
Very good value for money although the coverage isnt great sometimes even in centers of cities or towns,1
"No issues with the service, only complaint is with the bills. If your bill is over your contract amount it does not explain what the cost is for, this should be listed separately",1
"The phone service has been good, but the app hasn't worked for months now, so it's hard to keep track of data usage and charges. This has been very frustrating.",1
The signal is not cover some part of the country.No 5G available.Good value for money. Good for using abroad.,1
"Service I average I can never log on to check usage.Networks is average, plenty of areas where there is no signal",1
Great prices and service. Just a real shame they don’t offer Apple Watch support. That is the only reason I left.,1
"It's a great network, excellent value for money including EU roaming. BUT! Try to get on the internet in central London and you will be bitterly disappointed! ZERO download speed. Even sending a WhatsApp message is a challengeCome on guys! You can do better than that.",1
"5G coverage is very sporadic.  Apparently unlimited roaming, but small print states limit of 30GB.  No means of identifying how much roaming data used on the app",1
"Customer services is fully automated, there is nobody to talk to. It's very poor is that.If you don't have a signal you can not contact your provider over the phone.I haven't spoke to anyone in the year I had this contract other than 15 mins on a text thing then I got cut off. I will not use ID mobile again.",1
"It's ok, not the best service but alright, nothing special.",1
"Don't know if it's my phone or ur coverage but my 4g is very slow. It can take an hour to receive a picture through messenger/whatsapp or to see a webpage, e.g. bbc weather. Person next to me in office receives far better signal. On the up side, I love the free roaming as I have 4-5 holidays abroad each year.",1
"Your signal is sometimes crap, you can't send mojos with a message I get charged my phone keeps loosing WiFi signal and difficult to pick WiFi up",1
"Easy to transfer, Although my monthly rate did go up slightly shortly after I had joined. Reception is ok, Not as good as my previous phone company and I also now have ""dead"" spots around where I live which I never use to have.",1
Roaming charges overseas very expensive WiFi in public places 😱,1
Roaming charges very expensive charged for WiFi overseas in public places 😱,1
The coverage is notva good as i would like,1
"Signal coverage could be better, particularly when I'm at home (DL17 postcode)",1
"Plan price and phone (Google pixel 7A) very good, Mobile coverage very sketchy.",1
I think ID mobile should include free picture messaging in their contracts.,1
Really poor service. Really poor product and really poor coverage.,1
Signal in north west England is crap couldn't use internet.,1
Tryed to updated to my pay monthly non contract and was told I couldn’t as no had my id for a year but as I said I don’t have a contract?? But have to wait a year to changeBut could leave and come back and update to what I wantedWas offered money back on account but never received that,1
No real criticism I just don't give platitudes,1
"More innovation as to roaming, packages and do not rely on consumers to stick with ID if there are no incentives/offers",1
"I want clear information when I go to a roaming country. I have sometimes received a message to say charges will be added, even when in one of the 50 countries where roaming is allowed.Why isn’t Switzerland included?",1
Internet coverage isn't great quite often I struggle to get a signal,1
The signal can be very poor where I am living,1
"Most of the time I am experiencing reception issues, example, if I am in wembley, willesden, hampstead gardens and some more places, some time it's make me  frustrated. I am thinking to change another better provider.",1
If your phone is stolen the online only help is quite laborious to navigate - ok in the end but a bit of a car sick journey in the first 36 hours - hint if you haven't got your phone you can't do 2 factor authentication,1
Signal is poor and drops out anywhere in U(,1
The coverage is not the best,1
My only real gripe is that when I’m travelling around the country I have to rely on free Wi-Fi my data never seems to work,1
"Works okay at home but abroad the roaming sometimes just doesn't work, there's no manned helpdesk and so no help. Also, it doesn't work on the tube, which is absolutely crazy.",1
Definitely good value but the data coverage isn't always great.,1
"When there is a good signal and 5G coverage, all is well. As soon as my phone says 4G I know I'm in trouble and can forget trying to do anything internet dependent. Problem is, the coverage around the coasts of North Devon is very variable. and even in populated areas you can find yourself with poor or no connectivity. When I was with EE this was much more infrequently an issue.",1
"I seem to get this transfer money message several times a week.I don’t have any debts? Or need anything that I could not pay for now. If I needed any extra money, I would apply to yourselves as first stop.",1
Coverage isn’t as good as advertised. Quite a few dead areas. Which lets the network down. Everything else works perfectly,1
"Under same account (aka email address) I ordered 3 plans, with 3 phone numbers.When I receive email there is no unique ID to identify each plan (diff. phone no.). There is no information to know for what phone number they write back.It is so much confusing.",1
"I like rates and the coverage in the UK,  however abroad it is so expensive to use even in a European member state such as Montenegro or",1
Trying to upgrade but can’t because 2 accounts are in my name me and my wife and use same email so can’t look what I have used.,1
"I have found id mobile great for my needs, OK coverage where I live and sensible pricing.  Downside is roaming in France/Spain.  It is advertised as included but the coverage/ signal strength is awful and rarely works.",1
Signal. Is terrible. Downloading painful. Once contract is up I think I will go back to EE.,1
"Coverage and 4g/5g is great, the app let's ID mobile down as it very rarely works",1
You don't send out any free offers example free coffee vouchers or discount for shops etc .your network signal has gone down hill the last 6 months yes very disappointed lately.,1
In the past I have found difficulty with logging on and have had to change passwords on a number of occasions.,1
Very good price. European coverage has been frustratingly poor for me.,1
Very reasonable rates never went up in the years that I subscribed. Left as I was having issues with phone reception in my home and I could get a better deal on data limit for the price.,1
I dont like being charged to send photos,1
"I get along fine with my phone,however it would be better if I could go into a shop and speak with someone,also to look and hold any new phone that I might be interested in the future. Joined you through car phone warehouse which no longer has any stores,that’s why I will probably switch to o2 when my contract expires.",1
Poor phone signal in my area. Otherwise great communication,1
Constant poor signal and could hardly ever use the Internet.,1
The network etc works fine but the app is a complete nightmare and won’t let me on it.,1
"Most of the time coverage is good, but sometimes it’s very frustrating when you need coverage and it’s not around hence 3 stars otherwise it would be 4/5 the quality of calls is generally good I have not had to interact with the service department so far which is good",1
"I travel all over the UK, and the signal is petty bad calls always dropping same with the data",1
Poor reception where I live and really find it hard to work out from the Ap when my contract ends - but I’ll be switching as soon as I can,1
"It’s ok, not the best service, weak signals outdoors",1
It would be very useful to have up-to-the information on recent data usage and cost incurred- displayed on your app.,1
"I have been having the worst signal since I have been with this company. It's so frustrating for me, tbh I can't wait until my contract finishes.",1
I have trouble getting a signal in my house and places outside of my home. Never had this problem using a previous network.,1
Both me and my wife have been with ID for years. Good network and Curry's are great if you have an issue.DOWNSIDE WHICH HAS ONLY BECOME AN ISSUE IS BILLS ARE NOT COMING IN AT WHAT THEY SHOULD. PREMIUM RATE TEXTS BEING APPLIED. NOT GOOD FOR OUR FUTURE CHOICE OF NETWORK,1
"It's ok,Internet drops out now and again so that can be annoying",1
I go bike riding and struggle to get a signal when out on my bike along the Merseyside river front.Worried that the same thing could happen if out in the countryside.,1
"Good reception when needed is most important. SK8 3TL IS 1 bar at best.Id replied no issues in the area and try switching to 4G, 1 bar at 4G is what I get. My wife also has the same issue so no point in trying sim in another phone. SK8 3TL is just poor coverage.",1
"I have no online facilities, It is too difficult to get support from id mobile . I need to be able to phone a help line to speak to someone if I have a problem with my phone, as I can’t search through a website!",1
The reception is not always good plus WhatsApp doesn't always work People cannot ring on it.,1
"Good price but loads of missed calls, voicemails sometimes come through a day or so later. Coverage pretty good, overall good generally for what I need.",1
"When i make phone calls and have to give numbers out the person at the other end cant hear.....just numbers, conversation ok.The help option is useless so camt get to the bottom of the problem.",1
Good low cost mobile connection. Difficult to speak to any customer service staff about an issue I have!,1
Generally happy with it but I wish they had a phone number to use for questions as well as a chat facility,1
I can't go over my data plan or use competion numbers.,1
"The internet reception can be very patchy. On recent holidays to Scotland and the Med, while my wife (using the same model phone) was able to access the internet, I could not get reception. This has happened a few times in different places and I am seriously considering changing providers.",1
Got repeated emails informing me it was time to upgrade my phone. However on trying to so and swap my package i was informed it was a 60 wait. Will be changing suppliers when contract now ends.,1
The price rise half way through the contract is extortionate and really takes the mickey.,1
"Although I live in London (only 4 miles from Trafalgar Square!), the ID Mobile signal is often very poor in my house, and street.  It's similar to what I would expect somewhere remote, like the Scottish Highlands.  Not very impressed.",1
I have to contracts with you mine and my sons and am struggling to pat for them every month,1
Mostly fine but still concerned that someone managed to get through your security system identifying as me to order an E-SIM some months ago and on that basis got into my online bank account with a view to fraud. The fraud was rectified by my bank but caused me to lose some confidence in ID Mobile.,1
Signal isn’t very good,1
Value for money but poor coverage in rural areas,1
There is lots of places i go where i get no signal st all i think this is very poor  for the size of your company  and will be leaveing  when my contract is due,1
There is no phone number to contact. Online communication is helpful but not meet all needs. Some needs cannot express online and need someone to talk.,1
ID Mobile don't give the same deals to existing customers that they do to new customers. You have to phone and threaten to switch to another provider to get a good deal.,1
Not enough information on app about contract end dates and if it is possible to change plans when in or out of contract.,1
Lack of contact with real person. Bot sent me round in circles without solving problem.,1
Like the price and the amount of data.Dislike how often I am unable to make or receive calls even when I have enough signal strength on 3/4/5 g.Sometimes I’m swapping SIM cards to make a call!😡,1
"Like the App when you can get into it. Using the App from my mobile keeps advising ""unable to connect to ID Mobile, Try again"". Tried deleting and reinstalling App but no changes.",1
No roaming in USA so had to buy another SIM card.Impossible to get any advise or talk to someone from ID mobileSignal strength and coverage is very good,1
"Very weak unreliable reception, unfit to run 2 devices at same time, so had to change to other provider with stronger WiFi strength.",1
"Overall it's a really good service. But I have been trying for ages to transfer an account I took out years ago for my daughter.She wants to stay with iD, keep her number and take over paying the account but I'm told this is not possible.",1
Poor serviceBetter coverage,1
"Firstly, the current iD Mobile app, which replaced a perfectly good one about a year ago, is very poor. Owing to a technical fault, it deletes the record of the registration / biometric setup process when the app is closed, so I have to re-register every time I open it. Also, the data usage graph is confusing, there is no indication of how many minutes of calls I've got left, and the details of my plan aren't given (they only appear on the bills).Secondly, while on a Channel crossing to France, the phone logged on to a non-UK and non-EU network without warning and I was charged for roaming beyond the permitted areas: very poor indeed.",1
Coverage at home is 5G full signal but at work in Chelmsford it’s barely one bar of 4g and sometimes it’s just 3G which is annoying. Not sure why this is but on the whole the coverage is fine.,1
It would be nice to actually speak to a  person rather than just a automated service. On the very few occasion I have managed to get through it's been extremely difficult to actually navigate to the department you require and the call is ended simply saying try the app. I've experienced difficulty in  communicating due to  language barrier from some of the  staff at the call center. If this occurs it may nice to be transferred to another colleague who can help.On the question of Date of experience I unfortunately can not submit a date as I've give up trying to call I use the app which again does not give you a option to call should you need it. Very frustrating from the customer that you don't offer this as a service provider. As a customer the satisfaction is some what disappointing..,1
I just find alot of people say  when I am on a call I fade in and out ...dont think it is a problem with the phone but with the network,1
"I don't have very good connection for my area and where I work, across south and west Wales 😞Thankyou for quick response with suggestions, much appreciated idmobile",1
"After a system update,  my phone stopped working.  Apparently the update made changes that were not compatible with my phone.  No notification was given to me and I had to get a new phone.",1
"OK but reception iffy in some areas probably due to 3G switch off, may go to an EE MVNO eventually.",1
MMS is very expensive but apart from that the contract price is very low.However... what's the point of unlimited mobile data if it's slower than a dial-up modem 🤨,1
I couldn’t get to my voicemail whilst on on holiday in Cyprus.Why does voicemail insist on reading out the long number instead of saying who the message is from?Why isn’t the first option on voicemail to delete the message?,1
"I don’t like that my monthly cost is more than advertised, I can’t send photos to friends or respond to certain text messages from for example my local council confirming no change on our electoral status without you charging me.  Wont be renewing my contract.",1
My phone calls to and from me are never very good..my contacts break up and I break up to them...when travelling in Europe I can never get or receive calls???My husband has his contract with you and never gets any problems 🤷‍♀️,1
My only concern about ID Mobile is that I lose reception on my phone quite a bit and need to go to specific places in the house to get a good reception,1
Rollover data is fine. But the network suddenly started having many issues,1
Phone keeps cutting out during call  and we had to practically talk twice plus the other caller couldn't hear us and these were mainly local calls. we thought it was something to do with the network,1
"Since you up dated the ID mobile app I havnt been able to log in keeps saying don't recognise my phone number very frustrating as I used the app alot to check thingsAlso not happy you can't talk to anyone on the phone about anything anymore when you need help to sort the app ,online support is again very frustrating don't understand what your asking I've been customer for many years and because of this thinking of changing as want an app on my phone that works to use and to be able to speak to a human on the phone if any problems",1
"Difficult to talk to a actual person if you have problems which I did, my phone keeps saying not registered on this network when I try to phone out this occasionally happens",1
"All of the family are with ID mobile and are all very pleased with the cost/service.  The only reason that I have given it 3 stars is due to the fact that you can't change your mind until after a set period of time.  I purchased a Samsung (always been happy with Samsung) but after my daughter had an iphone I realised how good the quality of their photos was and tried to change, unfortunately you can't until your 2 year contract is virtually up.  It's a shame, I didn't want to leave ID mobile so you wouldn't have been losing my custom but I still couldn't change.",1
"I have not been satisfied with your services lately. very often it is very slow, but sometimes there is no internet at all. I don't understand how it can be, because I see that there is a signal but no internet, this has happened many times before. So now I'm thinking of looking at a more serious company.",1
Extremely concerned about security at ID and we've had no answers,1
"I bought a prepay SIM for free roaming in Europe. It was easy to set up, and good value for money.However they ran a hard credit check against me which affected my credit score, even though it was for only around £5 a month.Also when I wanted to cancel they still charge another 30 days which is unreasonable. Furthermore the plan can't be paused so I could only use the SIM once.",1
The Internet speed is slow and every time I check the service status in my area it is saying working on some issues and currently some maintenance is being carried out in the area.  Well I don't believe that. Generally the speed is slow ant that is just an excuse.,1
"Poor Customer service, app did not recognise my numbers",1
"The web mobile signal is poor, although the signal for mobile calls is good enough.",1
Reception not good. After being on a call for a while phone keeps cutting out,1
Sometimes the phone doesn’t ring and I either get a voicemail or see missed calls when I next check my phone,1
"My SIM card suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls, which was very inconvenient. It was difficult to contact ID mobile and the chat bot was very annoying. Finally had a live chat with agent but very slow. Hopefully a new SIM will be delivered soon",1
"You cannot talk to a person,cannot set up voice mail every password I choose say,s not allowed.",1
"I'm not really happy, the signal is awful, whether it's at home or away. Never have I experienced this as much as I have with iD Mobile.Also when I go to make a call, it doesn't ring on my phone, as if it's not connecting. But when it's been my Mum I've phoned it rings her end.Never ever have I had this.I can be on a call then all of a sudden it disconnects, which is very annoying if it's a call that's took me ages to get through too!So really not happy with this.",1
Good for the price and flexible options. Would have been 5 stars if the App was better.,1
I have been ID Mobile customer for some years and always found them value for money but since they updated their App I have been unable to access it or get access to my bills. Support and customer complaints have not been any help even though very apologetic and polite.Note. Recontacted today and somehow they have managed to fix the issue with the app that wasn't working yesterday. Pity it took over 6 months.,1
The signal reception in Rainworth is very poor.,1
Two things.1. Can’t speak to a real human person when needed.2. Orders missing and have to get it yourself from store.,1
Unfortunately we can not pay more to get roaming in Thailand,1
Your price and packages are good BUT coverage in my home Town is now non existant! If it’s not resolved I’ll have to move - it spoils a night out 😡,1
Every time I went out of the country to places that were supported I could not send messages on WhatsApp of I message which was what I was told that I would be able to do and I was continuosslt running out of data so I had payed my monthly bill and at the start of the month I lost all of my data this happened multiple times!!,1
Love the idea of any unused data rolling over to the next month.Can't always get connection,1
ID need to have data access activated in more countries .. I do some travelling and fine it very frustrating not having data access,1
id mobile are a well priced provider but signal coverage indoors is dreadfull so most of the time iam usung wifi calling that is included thankfully but the so called 5g coverage not so much good luck in your area 4g works out side ok,1
"Mobile phone service is good but trying to view your account online or in the app are abysmal! Works one time, if you’re lucky but not the next!",1
I tried for one month to login on my ID app ! It was impossible !!! Can you fix this problem please ? Thank you,1
Customer service is very difficult to contact and has a lot of potential to be more helpful and capable.,1
Unable to fix problems in an appropriate time,1
"The mobile reception around our home is terrible, no matter how much I complain it seems nothing is being done to sort this black spot we have.We also find your system of different email addresses for each mobile number we have with you very difficult to manage.You seem to have a very strict credit application criteria with little or no helpful comments to say why the mobile contract has been rejected.",1
Poor reception at times in border areas. Slow to roam at times.,1
"Poor reception coverage in many areas, too many times looking at the 4G one notch in the top right corner of my phone.",1
The price is good that's about as far as it goes extras cost and there not cheap I just get by with what I get,1
All good and fine in UK but couldn't make for the love of God make data work in roaming. No issues with calls and texts though...,1
Overall reasonably happy although there are still times when I can't access data without being connected to wifi. Usual trick of turning off wifi on mobile doesn't work in these occasions which is quite freustratijg,1
In some areas there is poor or NO coverage. The signal quality is very poor in areas where I need it.,1
"Signal keeps randomly dropping out mid call. This is down to 3 mobile who are the carrier. It used to be fine when I had a 3 contract (same phone) and then as expected OK with idMobile (MVO) for a few years.

Of course I do. I was a telecoms software engineer for many years including mobile. The reason why the calls now drop out is because in this area, 3 have removed a number of older transmitters replacing them with fewer 4G/5G transmitters resulting in more fringe areas (grey spots) until they start to backfill. I live in a small market town close to a major new city and not some rural back area. A similar and well documented situation existed when t-mobile merged with Orange to become EE and EE removed far more duplicate transmitters that they should have done basing this on computer modelling coverage rather than actual real world coverage. OFCOM became involved and EE had to fix it.  Going back to idmobile and 3 , I am expecting (and hope) this call drop out problem to substantially reduce once 5G covers this area. Or more to the point, 3 commission the currently idle masts. Having said all that, I was a direct customer of 3 for many, many years but moved to idmobile roughly for the same price. Idmobile have a far superior and easy to use website, data-rollover, and inclusive international roaming covering much of the world that 3 used to cover. I have no intention of cancelling my idmobile contract.",1
Would be good but 4g does not give me dataReally struggling at the moment with data on 4g. 5g is fine and can even work on 3g but not 4g. Help!,1
"Cheap phone deal, but customer service is awful when problems occur",1
Poor 4G service in many places in UK but a much better signal in the places I've been to in Europe. ID mobile say they are working on improving 4G but they probably are not.,1
Right level of communication eg good customer care and no over selling. Unfortunately service cover can be patchy especially when im at home. I need to go to certain areas of my house to be sure of getting a good enough signal to make/recieve calls which is annoying. Good product range and price.,1
Fair price for packageMeets most of my needsGood signal strength outside my home but inside signal can be weak /patchy,1
Reception is terrible,1
"Had a problem texting my wife who is also  an ID mobile customer for weeks, got fed up going to CarphoneWarehouse as they didi nothing to help. So, all our communications are being done on Whatsapp, BUT, occasionally I forget to Whatsapp, and text and they go through.",1
"Signal here in West Cornwall is not brilliant. Also texting is annoying, especially to my wife, or anyone else on an I phone, as the network seems confused as to how the message is sent. i.e keeps trying to send via Wi-Fi instead of ordinary SMS. iD Mobile is good at dealing with spam texts though which is good.",1
Very good service in Cuurys setting up my new phone.  No other experience,1
"Inability to have a family account.I have set up accounts for myself, my wife and two children with ID but cannot have one account to manage all of us. It makes it very difficult to have four separate email addresses to access their accounts and manage the spend/usage, especially for the children.",1
Good service from ID …. Not sure about the 3 network ….. not as good as what 3 seems to think it is,1
"Firstly your signal coverage and call quality is very good, including abroad. Also the ability to use my phone as at home whilst abroad is very useful. On a day to day basis I'm very pleased.Where I feel let down by you is twofold. If ever I need to contact you I'm unable to talk to anyone. I'm forced to use your chat system. This makes me feel somewhat disconnected from you and being kept at arms length. I'm sure it's vastly cheaper for you, but I question it's customer service.Also I recently changed my call package with you to a cheaper one. This suited my needs and my pocket. I was told that there was no way I could keep my existing number. One I had for over a decade. Being able to miraculously keep while swapping services providers, including yourselves! I've also noticed you can magically keep your original number if you upgrade or swap to your heavily promoted offers. Having to change my number has caused some amount of stress and I'm still not 100% sure everyone has my new number even now.",1
"Signal, especially mobile data is very poor a lot of the time.",1
Switzerland isn’t included in your European countries,1
Poor network coverage.Data is almost unusable.,1
"Overall good reception but in quite a few time I have no signal at all,Very disappointed.",1
Great communications and price but the signal in my area is inconsistent and regularly drops off during calls.,1
A good price but for me the network strength is poor.,1
"Massive data allowance for a small price, but comes with issue where some major towns, e.g Keswick have phone coverage but no data which for a tourist spot isn’t good enough.In regards to the reply, I have already checked the websites mentioned for issues and none are reported. I have used the community board for help but I get the same response from there.",1
Poor signal in some places or slow Internet speed..,1
"Coverage. I’m having issues with coverage. I’m in Cornwall, coverage on the main roads seems ok but as soon as you move away from arterial roads the signal will just about disappear. I’d have thought that Three your provider would have been able to get a better network coverage. It doesn’t appear to have gotten better in the last eight years since I was last in Cornwall.",1
Very few places where I am getting 5G signal. Poor signal or very poor signal in most other areas I have been to. Very disappointing.,1
"ID Mobile gives fantastic offers, they would do much better with working on communication, training and admin staff.2 weeks ago I did but a sim only plan on line, easy and swift process. in 1-2 days I received the email with transaction number and instructions how to port the mobile. I followed the instruction and provided my PUK code for porting my number from previous provider to ID Mobile, what happened after was very disappointing.As per the emails Sim was sent, No tracking number, Sim was sent by “2nd Class Royal Mail”, Porting the mobile followed on the day specified while the Sim Card never arrived!!This did result in me loosing the mobile service completely. I am a surgeon and I do on-calls which mandate that the hospital reaches me via mobile. Was not very pleasant scenario.I tried to communicate with ID Mobile, they have this frustrating form of AI assistant that loops around itself and never gives you answers but provides you with links for forums. After 2 more days I managed to “Chat” to a customer service on line. The lady advised that I need to go to “Currys” as ID Mobile is a trade name for Currys, She advised to take a photographed ID so they can provide me with a Sim and activate the line with my old number. This looked too easy for me to believe, I had a copy of the chat emailed to me.As soon as I finished work, picked my passport and went to Currys, Exactly what I expected, David at Currys says: Sorry sir, this is very wrong information, I can only give you blank sim and you have to call them. Trying to explain that “There is no one to talk to and no number to help” did not add much to this waste of time conversation.Just to note, the chat service is only available until 18:00 then it gives you automated response.I went back home and fiddles online to find that I can simply do the porting on line via an authentication code that they will send to my mobile “That I do not have” !!Following some further search and frustration, I managed to get the code via my email I used to purchase the plan !During activation, it gave me at least 15 times message that “Something is wrong, try again”. Following 20 attempts, I got a different message that this sim card was previously activated !!Testing the sim card, It started working. HallelujahConclusion:ID Mobile has not trained its staff to know what are they managing or advisingID Mobile is sending important Sims after activation with untracked 2nd class Royal Mail! If someone gets hold of your mobile, may become able to get authentication codes for all your bank accounts..etc. Dangerous practice. Please use a safe tracked serviceID Mobile has a very poor customer service level as it is all on-line but very limited to probably one employee on the other side of the globe !For Customer:Do not port your number until you receive the Sim CardDo not try to communicate with ID Mobile, you will get frustrated and get no where.If you face my situation, Get a blank Sim from Currys, click, lost or damaged sim, for replacement, you will manage to do it online provided that you have registered with them your email.Conclusion:I will see how will the service go, I may buy again from them is phone and net service is satisfactory but I will be very careful to avoid similar situations and loosing my number for 10 days.",1
With id mobile being on the 3 network I expected great coverage but I experience network and call drop outs quite regularly!I left O2 for similar reasons and may try another provider in the future.,1
Can’t get data in cities. Even when I have a 4g signal,1
Unfortunately I can't get roaming access in Canada,1
Found it hard to talk to someone regarding sim not working in a new phone  nowhere on app to contact,1
The data signal keeps dropping the data is also slow. It doesn't matter my location either. There is NO support regarding this problem. Which is frustratingly annoying.Please sort it out with the 3 network.,1
Coverage isn't greatNo tube coverage,1
Network quality is poor. Too much call drop.,1
On a trip to France last week my SIM stopped working. Unable to access my ID account to resolve the problem as I could not receive code you were texting me.,1
Using 3 means that I am very restricted in the data I can use it is very limited,1
"Not able to contact anybody who could help me ,keeps saying login details are wrong,just left in limbo ???Update,iD reached out and after explaining the issue it was quickly resolved via a discussion on X which is not ideal but at least it was resolved.",1
the contract price is fine.  but as for international roaming the prices are dreadful with yourselves. Good job I disabled my sim card and just used hotel wifi,1
"I have 3 accounts, mine and 2 other family members. Find no flex in creating one account and sharing rollover data...",1
Don't get internet in some areas and don't get free data roaming on holiday in turkey.. see better deals on website than I am on no customer service to call tried once to change to a different contract and ended up having 2 contracts going should be help for the elderly it's hard to try and change to better contract,1
The problem i have with  ID Mobile is you can't contact or speak to anyone  +the app is absolutely ridiculous to navigate i have been with you for a long time now +normally have to learn to solve any problems or anything that's wrong myself  or ask friends i am currently trying  to cancel  my last contract as I have already started  another one with you I will probably have to stop at the bank then you will contact  me you really need some customer service training in place,1
Getting charge for premium taxis at that I did not make,1
All is ok with the service . One thing that’s not good is I can’t get a signal in my home which is frustrating so I have to use WhatsApp.,1
"I find it odd and very alarming in this day and age, that despite having service indicated on my phone 2,3,4 bars of 4g and unable to connect to the network for a simple phone call. Let alone data for sat nav or other connectivity. Very poor",1
"Network signal, poor signal service at Fenchurch st station, Cheshire area Rayleigh",1
Like the price and all things relating to the phone.I'm in a complete muddle about viewing the account online. Never have been able to work it out.,1
"Recently I have found there is a distinct drop in coverage, phone shows 4g but doesn’t work, if I find 3G nearby it works better",1
Price fir tariff is great. But signal is poor. I only ever have 2 bars or less,1
"Having recently moved to ID Ive had no problems until today, when my service has dropped out and I am unable to make calls.  Ive checked and there are no service issues in my area and my phone is compatible. Ive turned flight mode of & on, turned the handset off & on and still no joy.Trying to get assistance is a total headache. The chatbot system is useless. Ive tried to speak to a person but thats not even loading! Very poor service levels, ID.** Updated review to 3* as issue now resolved. Useful for customers to know that messaging via facebook messenger illicits a human response. **",1
No service in Denmark or in Norway and week signal in my area plus the app is difficult to access now,1
Reception was terrible while at Lindisfarne festival last weekend.Zero reception while friends had full 5gNetwork should be improved in rural areas.All good in towns and cities and good value.Thanks,1
Poor signal and unable to make calls or calls drop. Seems to be going worse. Recently been abroad and worked great both internet & mobile calls. Shame UK is not the same,1
Can’t get hold of you,1
Very poor mobile coverage in many area around the uk.,1
"The basic package is ok the price is good,the big problem is the three network the signal keeps going off , I've been with ID almost a year and have lost almost seven weeks of phone use , twice it was off over two weeks solid and never a apology from ID bad very bad customer relations.",1
Poor signal in an area where signal strength is supposed to be strong.,1
Average 4 and 5G very slow,1
Keeping my informed,1
ID are a great mobile provider.The WiFi calling option which is included in their packages is invaluable. Also rolling over unused Data from one month to the next is helpful.Unfortunately the 3 network is patchy at best and occasionally hopeless in our area. It would be helpful if ID could press the 3 network to improve their coverage.,1
Signal  not very good when in the cou try side.,1
I find it very odd that in a few shops and buildings I get very limited service. I'm aware that sometimes it's down to the construction of these places but surely your service should be strong enough to still give a reasonable connection without cutting out? Perhaps I need to find a more reliable provider?,1
Decent phone and data service. Incredible value for money but customer service isn't great at all. Upgrading or switching to iD can be very painful. Billing/app also not good.,1
"When out of the uk the coverage is terrible, thought it was just my phone that was the issue but my wife is with ID also and we both had major trouble using our devices abroad but friends on other networks worked fine, major issue for us, seriously considering changing supplier",1
"One Issue. When I'm at home, the signal strength is so poor, It's almost impossible to carry out a voice call. I've tried connecting to the home network, but the signal is still ""dropping out"" all the time. All other solutions have also failed. I'm guessing the fault lies with the host network, which I believe to be Three, otherwise I would have given a much lower rating.No other issues.",1
The service is good except in BH6 4 area of Bournemouth. Cannot make receive calls unless you find hot spots.Also we cannot use ID aims in the United States when on holiday which is not good if we have Banking/cards issue as the Bank know our normal phone numbers if we are in trouble and need to call UK.,1
"Not able to speak to anyone,called a few times, says go to website",1
Reception out of home is average at best.,1
The contract price is great but the reception on 3 mobile is patchy.,1
Poor app that requires re login every time.,1
"The billing, charges and app use are fine however the poor connection in our area is the concern.",1
I dont like that it is difficult to speak to someone if you need help,1
Dont always have network!,1
Good price and a good reliable service,1
What I dislike is that you are unable to talk to someone over the phone.And could do more to help with traveling to non EU countries like USA and Canada.,1
Cheap contract which helps in the current climate. I travel alot with work and can't get connection alot of the time,1
You appear to make better offers to new customers - that you never put to existing customers.,1
"Signal coverage poor in some parts, lagging video/film using data",1
"The first thing that appears in the app on home screen should be your current data and minutes plan with allowances remaining + Current monthly plan costs and Bill Capping  - not an advert to upgrade.Advert could be replaced by a question/ link buttons for Upgrade options eg ""Need more data?"" or ""Need more Minutes?"" or ""Need new phone?"" .Should also be a link to costs for non inclusive charges for roaming - it will win you customers if you're honest and up front.And why not also sell unlocked phones outright ie not just as part of a contracted bundle?",1
"Great price, but I seem increasingly unable to get a signal when I'm out and about, which is a big nuisance factor.",1
"The phone service & ease of changing contracts is fine, but I don't like the fact that it appears impossible to speak to someone in person if there is a slightly more complicated issue. Yes, there is the live chat function, but those features are not, in my experience, as satisfactory as being able to actually talk to someone.",1
Can't complain about the price or the coverage. It's the customer service that just have no idea which is a shame and laughable.,1
Quite a cheap but poor coverage in my part of the UK and very expensive to use abroad. I purchased a second e-sim to use abroad to avoid ID’d high roaming charges.,1
Great valueGreat signalGreat appCustomer service?….. non existent!,1
Coverage where I live is very poor despite the map saying it should be good and there is nowhere to report it as a problem,1
"The coverage leaves a little to be desired...My wife and I both have the same iPhones - but with different carriers. We can be in the same location, but she gets reception while I, with ID, don't.Yes, they are cheaper - but the cost reduction has to be considered against having proper coverage.",1
Great price per month but not a great coverage where I live.,1
Service seems very intermittent and unreliable.,1
Mostly very good however in the Lake District and Yorkshire dales signal is very poor to non existent,1
Signal patchy,1
Since the software upgrade I was unable to log on to my account for months.  It has been resolved now but so frustrating.  The s/w upgrade was ill thought thru which did a lot of damage.  Going forward if there are no further issues I shall upgrade my review.. Thx,1
My bill was £9.14. it should be 7. Don't know what I did wrong,1
Not being able to speak to someone directly after signing upProblems when roaming in EU,1
"I can't use my phone to make calls from my own house. Neither can my wife (also an ID mobile customer). We have searched your website to try and find out how to report this, but we just get directed to your 'User Forum'. I'm not prepared to spend hours trawling through incorrect drivel to try and sort this - far more likely to change provider tbh...",1
The quality of coverage is not great. My phone is always the first to lose network. But the service is reliable in every other way. The app works and billing is fine,1
"The service is OK. However, it is unfair that customers have to pay more for a IDmobile plan directly when Mobiles.co.uk offers cashback for the same plan.Why not reward loyal customers!Ps: the IDmobile plan was compared on the same day, only a few minutes apart.",1
"Could not access phone options in Albania, Macedonia and Kosovo.",1
"Easy plans and payments. Bit stingy at 8gb/£6, but it is - what it is.",1
A lot of areas where is bad signal or no signal at all,1
Generally very good and competitive. Unhappy that existing customers don’t get same offers as new customers when looking at upgrading phone or plan,1
"ID are great for a low cost plan with rollover, WiFi calling and roaming. However, if you want to change your handset, they will not allow you to use 3rd party offers, they will only allow you to keep your number if you upgrade with them (usually at a higher price).",1
"I have had a constant battle with iD about why I can't send texts or Whatsapps to 4 or 5 digit numbers such as BBC Sport, TfL, Transport Police etc and I can't attach images to texts. When I complain iD ask me for streams of info about the messages that won't send, then either tell me it's been sorted (when it hasn't) or fail to reply. When I chase it up, they again ask me for stacks of info about the texts. I have given up, which I suspect was what they hoped I'd do. iD is cheap to use but you get what you pay for. I will return to EE. Oh, and reception on iD is awful, even in London. No signal (when my wife is connected to EE) or slow.iD have just replied to the above with the predictable reply they always send. ""Switch on premium setting"" - it is on! ""Change premium cap"" - it is already set to a high level.id's answers are scripted, not tailored for individual customer needs and lazy.",1
"The signal in the UK is hit and miss - just spent a week in the Malverns with minimal signal - so bad, I had to connect with local Wi-Fi or use my wife’s Tesco mobile to piggy-back just to check emails.  Similar issues when roaming in EU for 2 months - poor signal, no roaming in Switzerland.  Thankfully wife’s Tesco mobile saved the day yet again.",1
I don't think it is simple enough for the older person,1
The sim only tariff I'm on used to be a very good deal.Other company's are offering much better deals now.,1
The lack of USA roaming is an issue they have 50 Countries but not USA. I rang to see if there was a bolt on package and there is not. The operator did offer my PAC code to switch providers...did not feel valued,1
Coverage for data services seems not to be as good as other monile operators. My wife is with vodafone and her data services usually work in locations when my ID phone doesn't work.,1
The prices are great but the coverage lets it down. I know it's supposed to work off a bigger network but many times I have poor signal. Rarely do I get 5G and it's a new Google pixel phone,1
I like it when you tell me when my service is nearly up but you say check the app but I don’t know where the app is so I can’t check it,1
Data is to expensive,1
Price is great. Amount of data great. But coverage seems to be getting worse. Sat in the same place I used to get 5g I occasionally get 4g or even H. When abroad it seems to always automatically connect to the worse option. Whilst the wife's O2 is regularly 5g abroad. You can then manually change it.,1
You guys don’t support eSIM with Apple Watch and this is frustrating as I have Apple Watch that I would like to use without my phone on me.,1
I only get 3g at my home address,1
"I have no problem with my phone, samsung24 ultra when I'm out and about, however, when I'm in my home I have very little signal although my daughter who has an apple, and is on id, never has a problem wherever she is in the house",1
I'm not into working for others who's job it is anyway,1
"As usual, new customers get what was promised. I mean, after some time your internet speeds go down to unbearable. And in this world of today, the internet speed is what matters most. I’m waiting for Black Friday offers from other providers. ID has proven untrustworthy to me. Cheap but sh____.[edit]My residence area is 5G and low speeds have been registered for months. OUTSIDE. Anyway, it doesn’t quite matter if it’s 3, 4 or 5G technology. Speeds are linked to one of those technologies but don’t automatically guarantee the speed. So sorry, Tyler, but the below reply is of little value to me.",1
"Great value for money EXCEPT that I find in busy places my data speed grinds to a halt, even with four or five bars of phone signal! This happens consistently in a few places but not others, so not being able to use my phone just because I've gone somewhere in particular gets a black mark from me, especially given that somewhere else for example, I can have no issues at all? Who knows.",1
Signal in my area is NOT as good as stated. If it wasn't for wifi calling I'd move contracts to be honest. This comment refers only to the signal. The price of the tariff and its rolling data is excellent value!,1
It might be my phone or some other reason but I find the signal coverage could be a lot better as there are quite a few places where my phone loses contact with the outside world,1
Happy with most things 4g is very poor most of the time,1
I have been with this provider for a long time. Its just gotten unbelievable terrible. You can't get into your account online anymore as keeps coming up errors. The customer support even though talking to real people have confusing answers. I talked to 4 different customer support on the same day and got different information for the same question by all 4 people. Never got my questions answered. I'm leaving this after about 6 years. It used to be good and reasonable now its just a frustrating joke! I'd definitely find a better provider that can actually help and not have to guess what the support is talking about. I've had to ask for a PAC code so I can use the same number.,1
I love the price but my signal for both mobile WiFi and calls has been poorer over recent months.,1
I have been having problems making calls from my mobile and when abroad had no internet connection at all .Finding it really hard to contact anyone to resolve this,1
I would like to discuss about a new phone but I want to do so with an English speaking person,1
My phone calls cut out if I move from room to room. WhatsApp phone call never last more than a couple of minutes before I am cut off,1
"Very good in UK and easy to change details, plan, etc., on the app. Marked down as having set up roaming and international well in advance, was not able to use service (send/receive texts, make calls), when overseas.",1
Better coverage in parts of Glasgow please.,1
Struggle with customer support. Unable to access account on the web for about a month with no updates.,1
"There are a lot of areas where we don't have reception it is very bad as I can't make important phone calls, text or have access to data. I need this for work. you guys have to sort this out ASAP",1
"The network is great. I have no issues with coverage. The price is good.However, I recently had to try to contact you and although the chat can be useful, it didn't solve my issue. I actually needed to speak to someone.  That is my only criticism",1
Poor reception and coverage for my area. Phone calls and signal keep dropping off.,1
Coverage isn't as good as expected,1
"Hi - When I am abroad, I can not make any calls? Is there something I should be doing? Whats app works ok",1
ID mobile Signal quality has got progressively worse to the point of thinking about a change of provider.It was ok when I first joined Id mobile but now spend most of my time trying to get a signal. Which is a shame because id  mobile is a great company apart from that. Love the data rollovers and the price is amazing,1
Great price but signal isn’t always great . Bought to take away as an extra but often can’t use .,1
Convoluted savings plans that rely on people who can't be bothered to jump through the hoops,1
"Well been happy until its time to actually speak about changing my contract to a sim only . I am out of contract . I have been speaking to someone for obver an hour for a simple request . It sounded like a robot as they asked the same questions over and over . I asked a simple question , After almost an hour they said i will put you through to sales team , Then waited over 20 minutes for no one to be there . SO Frustrating to do a simple task . And trying to find the correct way on the app is impossible",1
I joined I’d mobile because of the free roaming. Very good in Europe but I was charged extraordinary amount for my time in the USA.,1
"Overall the service is good, only tjing can comment on as of late the reception has not been as good, not sure as to why? But it does start customers looking at other avenues, as this is the main service we require a 'reception anywhere' where possible!",1
The phone service (Three) is absolutely terrible. I keep losing calls and getting cut off. I wish I had been informed about this prior to my contract.,1
"Not the best coverage, can be hit and miss.  But low cost.",1
"Have been a customer for over 6 years now on a rolling 31 day contract so that I can change level of data from month to month, as a when required, very useful as well as data rollover. Sadly, over the last year or so,  I've noticed that signal coverage in some areas isn't what it used to be, shame really as I'm very happy with ID Mobile overall.",1
"I’m not sure if I can give you my receipt experience as I seldom use the phone as it doesn’t work indoors, James Bevan",1
"Existing customer upgrade offers not good compared to those offered to new customers, poor signal coverage especially out of town, main plus point is that it is cheap and offers EU roaming",1
ont good service. to mach problems. I don't like it.,1
Contacted you sat about an issue and was told it would be sorted within 24hrs 4days later not sorted,1
"Not easy to reach live chat, constantly referred to community.i pay id for a service not other users",1
"The service overall is pretty good. Sometimes though, the signal strength in my area is poor and I have to go upstairs to get a slightly stronger signal in order to make a call. Occasionally a call inexplicably drops out. Generally data availability is good but often slow.",1
"ID Mobile has a tremendous price advantage over its competitors. That comes with some downside however.....the reception is sometimes flaky (inconsistent) and in some areas within central London there is consistently no signal (in spite of trying at 'off peak' times as well as peak.) Right now I have problems using the internet and also the mobile phone...and service often drops out particularly in late-mornings. Also, don't expect realistic help, beyond the usual glossy patting-ourselves-on-the-back missives.....Since, sadly, the modern way is for companies to treat cutomers with little repect, at least ID Mobile is no worse than the rest.So if you want to pay very little, and have only basic needs, then they would be perfect!",1
"When in France recently I go no network connection, I contacted your chat line and it took over 2 hours to sort the problem out!",1
"The plus points, the price & customer service, both are first class! Now the negatives, sadly the reception in certains areas is poor and the voicemail on an iPhone does not work so you have to call the voicemail number. I would advise checking on the coverage in your area before getting tied into a contract and if that is OK then it is well worth joining ID Mobile.",1
"I'm coming up to end of my current contract term and you keep sending me reminders on new phones,. As a senior citizen I'm looking to reduce my costs everywhere and will take on a SIM only contract next time. My point is that nowhere in the guff you send me does it say SIM only upgrades are only available 24 days before my contract ends. So I ordered SIM only only to find out these were extras not upgrades. They have been cancelled. At time of choosing I am now going to shop around.After seeing your reply, why, when I cancelled orders within 48 hours of placing them and been told by your chat line staff that they had been 'returned and cancelled', and that any payment instructions would also be automatically cancelled, are you still writing to me to tell me that the direct debit is due to start. I have already informed my bank to cancel. You need to teach your staff how to cancel properly. Please note this all relates to new orders placed in July, not my existing deal due to finish around October.",1
"Signup was easy and the sim turned up quickly. Uses the Three network in the UK so coverage is decent. App allows you to accurately track costs and data usage. Reason for 3 stars is due to terrible coverage overseas. Was not able to get any signal, even in big towns and cities in Europe",1
Although I was due an upgrade I only did so as I was told the screen was cracked in fact it was the screen saver not the phone.,1
I want to see if you have a better deal but unable to speak with anyone and other network offers better deals so going to move,1
"Despite wanting to notify ID that I wanted to cancel my contract in order to ensure I didn't continue paying for my phone having paid the 24 monthly repayments this month, the person on 'chat' incorrectly insisted I had to wait until the day after the 2 year contract date. My contract reflected 24 days before the end date, but she argued that was incorrect!",1
Not happy with not having any internet in Mk2 Pinewood Drive area.,1
"ID mobile used to be one of the best value SIM only deals on the market but they seemed to have now fallen behind a bit in the value for money stakes with a lot of newcomers to the market offering better deals.I also have not been overly impressed by the coverage, while it seems fine in larger cities out in the countryside the coverage is 'patchy' They use the three network. My partner who uses another network did not lose signal on their phone on any of these occasions. I've also had issues at some places where you wouldn't expect such as some of the areas in/around Heathrow airport with no signal.Finally although they include free roaming across the EU watch out for countries that are not in the EU (but still in Europe) as they are not included. A good example being Switzerland which many other companies include in their free roaming but ID mobile does not.",1
"impossible to get any info, any support, anything, from anyone at ID Mobile once the [VERY COST EFFECTIVE] contract is on. On the other hand, would you wish to purchase more / buy more / upgrade, they are very efficiently responding.",1
"I hate not able to speak to someone on the phone when you have a problem, or able to ask for some assistance",1
I have found it impossible to link my 4 ID mobile accounts. so really very frustrating.,1
Good value for money but network coverage can be patchy (lots of dead areas even in major cities),1
No signal in my area around my house and streets.Need to drive 5 minutes till I get a signal.,1
I constantly get no network available for the phone but 4g ok,1
I don’t like the fact that I can’t speak to a real person when I’m dealing with ID mobile. I don’t want to chat to somebody in a group chat,1
We find it difficult to get a signal in most places and a very week signal at home.,1
"I seem to be living in, and visiting far too many places where I either have a minimal signal or even none!This is not a date issue, it’s a lot of the time.Too rural in Lincolnshire I guess?",1
Cheap and cheerful,1
"Back in April we lost all service for 5 days. When I complained I was informed that work was being carried out as part of the 3G switch off. Since then we have never had ""full"" signal coverage within the Town that I live in. Very disappointed with the outcome. Prior to the work I  always had 4 bars on the phone signal strength, now it is often only 2. Hardly an improvement in service.",1
Problems with website took long time to sort out.when I download statements & try to print them they come out virtually blank,1
We use Sim only to run Wifi on board a narrow Boat. The signal does deteriate and wifi is lost.Coverage is the problem.,1
I live in Norfolk and I quite often do not get a very good signal and sometimes my calls keep breaking up which is very frustrating as I haven't got a land line,1
Confusing and difficult to get my revised package. You cannot have a quick conversation with a human to make sense of it.But...all in all happy with iD.,1
"OK service provider, about the same as most - rarely offers good alternatives",1
"On Saturday 13th July all day and early Sunday morning, 14th July, I had no signal so I could neither make or receive a phone call. This has happened before on a number of occasions.",1
I could not get my old phone removed as it's in my husbands name.,1
"Recently switched from O2 to ID, had ended sim contract and ID offering great price- received my sim and it wouldn't work at all- customer service not helpful until the 3rd time when the agent sent me and ESIM and now it seems to be working alot better. Great app-able to monitor use and amazing price saving me 10 a month from my old provider! Would have given more stars if the switch over had of been straight forward",1
Price good.Choice of packages goodService/signal not so good very variableCould not use data abroadHelp menus not very helpful,1
"It appears almost impossible to talk to a real person! Where has the customer service gone? I am a non tech person and find your service, to be polite, not very good.",1
Was difficult  to get thru at 1st but better mow,1
"ID Mobile is very good. The problem lies in the network provider it uses, Three! I live in Wilmslow and use my mobile for work. I have never had a problem with the other network providers I have used in the past (O2 and Vodafone). However, the coverage/call quality on Three is little short of appalling and only 4G at most is available! Beware!!",1
Still cannot login to online account,1
I had a phone a,1
Can't make calls in house and texting difficult too,1
"Id mobile is cheaper than most,offers very much the same as other networks,only draw back is it uses 3 network who claim a massive coverage but I find it a below average service,most days I only get 1 bar,but as they say you get what you pay for",1
The upgrades offered aren't always available.,1
I like the roaming charges.Some of extra charges eg certain numbers (033)do not agree with.Non internet help/service is poor. not suitable for someone like me (pensioner/non technology savvy)Hardly ever see written bills records of use/charges.,1
Have been with iD for 4 years now and not had an issue with them until just having purchased a new phone. At no time was I informed that there was no way I could keep my old number as it was deemed I had 2 accounts and you can't change a number from one account to another in the same company,1
OK - eventually sorted out a big problem with the account about 15 months ago - OK since then.,1
Too frequently poor signal or no signal. Not always good reception,1
Find it hard to contact you with any problems,1
Variable coverage.  No usable coverage in my area,1
"Virtually impossible to use my mobile abroad. I've had trouble in France, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cape Verde and Sri Lanka.I've coped by using whattsapp in ordercto make calls ( using the hotel wifi only) but banking is a major problem as I can't get One Time Passwords.",1
When you can get a signal it’s a great deal but the signal has been getting worse and worse in the East Riding over the last year or so.,1
"Prices are brilliant, but the signal has gotten worse over the last year. I travel all over the UK and the signal isn't really good anywhere. All the family have ID via different mobile manufacturers and none of the signals are good.",1
"It's cheap, but absolutely zero ways to speak to anyone.Get what you pay for I guess",1
"I would like to have kept my old plan, but bought a new phone.  But I was told this plan would be better.  Not really, my last plan had 100gb of data which I could roll over any unused allowance and add to the new monthly allowanceI which could be used in full when travelling in Europe.  My allowance now is capped at 30gb in Europe on the unlimited data plan. Very disappointed with advice.",1
I used to receive monthly statements. I haven’t for quite some time. The phone signal is weak (1 bar outside) and connection to many top sites including yours can only be accessed via WiFi. I feel phone/mobile data suppliers are not doing their job effectively in putting pressure on mast owners to keep their infrastructure efficient enough for consumers to use reliably. Bar these issues you would have had a higher star rating.,1
Sometimes don't get a very good reception on some phone calls,1
Problem with the national test not coming through and sometimes texts sticking in the ether.,1
"First of all, I’ve had excellent coverage and service with ID mobile as my provider, so there’s nothing but praise for that, but the customer service is SO difficult. You get wildly inconsistent information from one person to the next and it can take hours to solve a simple problem! I’m trying to end my contract early and I’ve been given a range of different costs and different information from one person to the next. How can they all differ so much?? I wouldn’t mind but I’m not even leaving ID, I just want to move to a rolling contract and they make it stupidly difficult to do so!",1
Voice calls and internet access whilst out and about (in the UK and Europe) are very poor or impossible without logging onto someone elses’s wifi.,1
"Was VERY happy with original deal,Until I got a second sim for my daughter who ported her number and now I cannot see, amend or add to my account for billing / maintenance.It works and they are taking the payment   BUT...Automated help system is NAFF,Unable to get real HELP..... FROM A PERSON !!!!*** finally sorted the issue after talking to a person (family member) but still took ages and few attempts, Other than the support being fully automated the sim service is good ****",1
Good value but often poor connection when out and about. Not able to use on London Underground 😞,1
No warm body to talk to when you have a problem.,1
Not having free roaming in Australia.,1
Can’t use the app,1
Very difficult to get to speak to a real person. Thinking of changing.,1
"I’ve no problems, haven’t had to phone for years,So hard to comment on anything,",1
Took a long time to sort out a problem I had with my phone. The agents in Curry’s where I was sent one of them was useless. Fault finally passed onto tech team who sorted it straight away. Why that couldn’t have been done initially is a mystery,1
"When I tried to contact you via telephone for an urgent matter, no human to speak to. This is a major downfall of this Company. Not very good customer service.",1
It's my personal opinion that the coverage is not wonderful and several interruptions are very annoying.Would definately have to consider a different provider when contract ends unless of course things improve,1
"I inadvertently changed the agreement on one of my mobiles and was unable to revert to its original agreement. I tried emailing iD Mobile but got no response. It was not a lot more money, but I was happy with the existing deal. I accept it was my error in making the change, but would have liked the opportunity to cancel. My email to iD Mobile which was not answered did request cancelling the order.",1
We're I live is very bad phone coverage can be on the phone and it cuts out all the time,1
Coverage not great. Sometimes only 3g in our area.,1
Good - price for low use phoneBad - was told I would be able to see both phones on my account when I got an additional sim but seems you have to access account by app now.  As neither phone is in my possession I am stumped.Very bad - sim doesn't work in old Doro phones.  This wasn't clear before I got it so useless for the elderly relatives phone I'd bought it for.,1
"Good competitive price with lots of useful regular information sent. However, roaming do not include all EU countries, like other mobile networks. Also, minimal reception in some towns just 20 miles from London.",1
Service and signal has been really patchy lately. Calls keep getting dropped or people can't hear me. It's really frustrating !,1
A few days ago our phone stopped being to make or receive calls.  Nothing on the website covers this!  Luckily we have a local Carphone Warehouse.  There are telephone numbers online for there but they do not work.  We went there and member of staff seems to have fixed the problem.Your website and Chat are pathetic!,1
That all off your date you have left does not carry  over,1
New ZealandIt would be useful if roaming applied to other destinations other than EU,1
I was told to contact them to activate my replacement SIM.  They only provide online chat support and often don't understand your difficulty/question.  I was told I would need to go on their app to complete the activation but every time i entered info and clicked on 'continue' a box popped up 'oops something went wrong'.  Been trying now for over an hour.  Went back on live chat and they didn't understand my problem.  In the end I said 'I want to speak to someone'.  I'm in a 45 minute queue now.  When I did finally get to chat with someone and they were struggling to resolve the issue they cut me off. Very very frustrating so I will change providers when my contract ends.,1
I’m very disappointed that when I recently had a short break in Cornwall I had no signal whatsoever. Vodaphone is the only way in Cornwall. What happened to mast sharing??,1
I have been over paying for a long time and have had no replies to my inquiries.Have sent many letters to you over the past 12 months.Louise,1
"I’m afraid after twenty years with another companies network I chose to move because of an offer, it seems this was a mistake, the reception from I.d. is very poor in the area I’m in at the moment which is LA 6 1AD and I spend half of the year here, I have three contracts with I.d. and unless coverage improves I shall be moving on when the contracts end.",1
I have 2 different sim only deals with you one for myself and one for my dad. Sadly my father has passed away and I cannot contact you to cancel his plan.I can't just cancel the direct debit either as I don't know which one is linked to dad's and which is mine.It's totally impossible to contact you by live chat or any other way.This disappoints me. The plan us excellent and does everything I ask for but when there's a problem I just can't get it sorted,1
The one and only concern about ID is that the monthly charge goes up with inflation each year.,1
"Your ‘survey’ people are hopeless. Tried 3x different but valid email addresses to enter the prize draw. All were rejected. Had to choose ‘no’ to entering. You need to be more careful who you get to set these surveys. Very poor, ID. Very poor.",1
I needed to change my email addressIt proved to be almost impossible  very frustrating  i gave up so many times i i even went to a currys store to see if they could help but no they couldnt help!!! All new codes were sent to old emailBring back a person to talk too it would have been sorted in 5 minutes,1
Often I cannot use the phone outside as mobile data not working,1
"It’s alright  now , Thank you, I’m over it!   C.",1
I travel to North Yorkshire quite frequently to a caravan park-and my service is terrible. I can text or call first thing in morning and late at night and I have no reception in between them times. If I needed help I wouldn’t be able to reach anyone. We don’t have Wi-Fi but my mobile data can’t be used.when I was using a different network this didn’t happen. At home in the north east I have no issues with data,1
do not get good signal my old phone was better than the one i have now,1
Took out the contract with a new phone and network reception has been good. Customer service good as well but only three stars because you have to record your own message you can’t use a pre recorded version like most networks. As a small business owner I prefer a pre recorded one,1
"Overall, it's a great price and saving me a fortune that O2 were taking feom me each month, just when I researched coverage, I was assured I'd have 100% coverage where I live, but very often I have nothing, which is quite frustrating as I rely on it for everything. But, that said they're a really good set up and easy to use",1
Day to day service okay BUT impossible to log in to the account,1
Service in the U.K. is excellent but I’m very disappointed that the company can’t offer a fixed price package for our trip to the USA.,1
I experience too many problems with id mobile.,1
Everytime we go on holiday to Isle of Wight I can't use it. No signal or its very weak.,1
the network coverage is poor but the price is low,1
"There is no physical person to speak to, just ai bots... that is not good for a phone company when people have a problem.",1
Lack of people contact. Inflation costs on  phones that have not been subject to cost increase for ID. Excuse to charge more than agreed priceCURE - leave ID at end of this contract,1
"I have been with ID Mobile for a number of years, very happy except for the very miserable experience using their live chat service to try and resolve an issue. Customer Service  is now 100% online , my chat wait time was tedious and difficult to engage with, the advice given was incomplete.",1
I was happy with O2 until Currys moved me to ID Mobile.,1
"Service was good whilst on holiday recently to Portugal. Signal quite good in Portugal. NOT GOOD where we live in Middlewich, Cheshire.",1
Disappointed in coverage especially at home.,1
I canceled  my contract and paid my bills via direct debit today a received a final demand saying i owed£27.18  i went online thinking this was my final bill to pay it and an automated voice saying i owe nothinggoodbye and hung up.What's going on with them ?.,1
"It's ok, just a lot of dead spots where the is literally no signal at all. Which is bit of a concern having medical issues",1
"Frustrated that I cannot access my account online. I have changed my password 4 times to no avail ,",1
My signal is awful has been for a few weeks now. Can't Google anything as it times it's self out. It used to be good so don't know what's going on. But I love the cost of my plan. Any data I don't use gets carried on so you always get what you pay for,1
"Cannot get online abroad; it’s not my phone because I didn’t have this problem with EE, and have used your advice for phone settings, but it makes no difference. Otherwise, great service but sorry, because of the overseas issue, you’ll be losing my custom.",1
Can't get very signal. Was told you would send me a new sim card but never received one,1
I would have given five stars except for the fact that the app doesn't seem to work.Thanks for your reply - sounds like I need to re-register for the new app. But the app won't let me re-register only option is to sign in and when I do that it says something went wrong....,1
"iD Mobile offers basically everything you'd want. EU Roaming, WiFi Calling and good Customer Support for great prices.The problem for me however is the Three network they're running on. When connected, 5G can easily reach speeds up to 500 or even 1000Mpbs, but in Central London there are many spots where there is no connection of the network is too congested. Your phone might show 4G+ of 5G, but you won't actually have any internet.For me it's more important to have a reliable connection than insane speeds, so for this reason alone I switched to O2",1
"Hello, I have a sim from you for over a year. I am no longer in contact, but I stayed  because you have a very low subscription price and because I have no problems in roaming. But the signal is weak most of the time, often if I don't have wifi I can't use the internet at all. That's why I have another phone on another network so I can use it when I don't have signal from you.",1
Was very satisfied until trying to register onto the new app. That’s why the 3stars. But for the hassle involved you’d have rated highly. Don’t understand why existing customers information wasn’t moved across by I’d.,1
Not easy to speak to anyone is my only issue,1
"I don't always have a good signal, therefore I can't always gain access to open my apps",1
Zero reception at my home initially took weeks to sort it out. Now improved.,1
The signal isn't great on the outskirts of Durham.,1
Very intermittent signal around Carmarthen,1
"The price is good, but where I live LN11 7 the signal level is low and the Internet speed is low 1-2Mbps. My wife has Talk Talk service and get 20-24 Mbs.",1
"The only issue I have is that I quite often have no, or a weak signal compared to my last provider.Otherwise fine.",1
"The set up of account, app and communication is good.  The most annoying and infuriating thing is billing.  If you DD is missed they cancel it - does that makes sense to me no.  Secondly your phone is cut off and blocked after 2 days..  So this is where it is so infuriating because you can't make a payment as a result!!  online because you can't authenticate it with your banking app because you're blocked, you can't pay with the app because you're blocked, and you can't pay by calling 7777 as you still need to approve the payment via the banking app which won't open! You then can't transfer banking funds as you are blocked! I mainly use apps for banking.  I spent literally a couple hours of my day sorting it out.  I get my payment was late hands up but what if you were sick or something two days is just too soon and for this reason I don't think I want to renew my contract again. Apart from that coverage etc is good.  Plan went up in price a few pounds too after one year in.",1
Major problem receiving security codes from bank.  Had to change to landline.  It's really a pity as most everything else is fine.,1
On a whole I find ID fine to use. My big problem is the new Website. Not easy to use to find information about account and contract details. It's just aw well that people working in their stores understand and are very helpful. No idea why they changed the old site which was easy to use. If it ain't broken don't fix it.,1
"International data does not work,  despite being online with a customer service agent for half an hour or more before going to Montenegro,  the data did not work- I was assured repeatedly it would - had to buy an International E sim while out there, very disappointed",1
Price great but poor mobile service in my area,1
no email contact. you claim 24/7 support but only through automated,1
"I gave 3 stars because I often have a problem getting a signal.This means that phone calls sometimes drop out, so whilst I like the phone, I cannot rely on the service.",1
Often have trouble getting a strong signal. Can be slow.Good value. Good service on the app.,1
"Service and value is fine. Unable to access the app, so unable to apply any control. Inability to speak to an agent, sucks.",1
It is an inexpensive contact. However I don't seem to get the data coverage I did with Vodaphone previously.,1
Good price ok service,1
"I've rated 3 stars for the simple reason of the terrible signal I'm receiving, it's not just where I live as it's the same everywhere I go, a few of my friends are on ID and they too are having the same issueI believe its down to 3 mobile services as ID use their signal, 3 have always been a dinosaur in the mobile connection world and probably nothing will ever changeAfter being with ID for a few years, I'm now considering switching over to another provider",1
"Signal very poor. Told I can't be heard at times or signal is breaking up, when I'm in my own house. Never had such issues when I was with Vodafone. Also get a message telling me I have reached my data limit when I have LOADS left. However, tied into iD contract. Couldn't really recommend iD due to the issues I have. Happy to have feedback or support from iD.",1
Cos it so hard to chat to real person without having to jump though task to get the chat to real person. Your webpage is tearing as you try to find support to chat to real person no great overall,1
It would be nice to actually see what you have used in your app ...if it's there I cannot see it ..ie if I've used 25gb of my data allowance I want to see it,1
Sometimes in London in Square Mile forced onto 3G network.No signal in London Bridge station.Roaming is very slow to connect and lose signal often.Very limited 5G,1
Cheap contracts. You cant speak to anyone on the phone though so be prepared to wait for absolutely ages for responses on their live chat (I'm currently speaking to someone on the live chat...there's a min of a 5min wait between each answer. Painfully slow).,1
"Some of the best prices tariffs available, haven’t seen anything as competitive although I do experience more dropped signal than my previous provider.",1
"Since upgrading I am unable to access my account, and unable to use the app.Also the signal has deteriorated, but that may be since G3 has been switched off? I don't know...Prior to the upgrade I would have given 5 stars.",1
"I hate the new ID app! The old one allowed me to add a ""just in case""  ""shock-proof"" £5 margin to my monthly bill.  Then If I made calls to abroad or to premium rate numbers  or used extra data  then it would be taken out of the 5 pound. Now I can only pre-pay for extra data ( which I may not use) or extra minutes ( which again I may not use). And I will get charged  even if I don't use the extra data/minutes.Badly done ID!And I hope your cover abroad has improved. Last time I was abroad even after calling ID I could not make any calls . I never had that problem with Vodafone.",1
I would like to contact you by telephone - not online - I recently tried to change my phone and I was unable to go further with it as curry’s said my mobile no didn’t match your records - I wanted to speak to a person not via online,1
"It works ok so far use in my IPad while roaming.Tried today to login  get to success, then it asks for phone number etc won’t accept it and goes back to square one.Tried help not very helpful! Given up",1
The value for money is great as well as the coverage. My one gripe however is with billing. It seems like they take the money for the billing whenever they like as long as it’s ‘around’ a certain date which isn’t helpful when people have other bills to pay and money going out. Also the live customer service chat is awful as you have to talk to a robot before you can get through to a person and the chatbot never seems to grasp the issue at hand.,1
Better Network,1
"Pretty good, apart from giving my Pac request that I did not ask for and attempted to get in my bank account",1
Had a lot of problems getting on the app,1
Not great coverage,1
I have been really pleased with ID mobile buy using the phone/Internet internationally could definitely be better. There isn't even an option to use the phone when we've been in the USA and Canada.  We'd be happy to buy US usage but they don't offer that.Also trying to get in touch with anyone is impossible. Given up many times.It's good value for money but there are downsidesWe would look to move when we have the time to investigate alternatives.,1
The actual product from ID Mobile is very good. They fell down on customer service when the only option was to ask an online forum of customers. I still believe after chasing 6 referral bonus payments that never turned up without extensive chasing  that they offer this dangled carrot and deliberately make it difficult to claim so you give up,1
I’m very pleased with how you handled things in the lock down situation bu I have just finished a holiday in Australia and needed to use my phone for medical purposes and couldn’t every time I did I had a text telling me the cost so I am can’t understand why you don’t do Roming,1
Good value in UK and Europe.Hopeless in India.  I’d have happily paid a daily rate such as Vodafone do.,1
Can’t get the updated app to work. Frequently there is no signal.,1
"Fantastic Price, but unfortunately the signal is not the best in a lot of areas. Hence my new mobile is slower on the internet than my friends and I don’t always get a reception too. That is the only downside of using ID mobile and I am looking at changing to a stronger more reliable signal for my area.",1
Improve communication and support customers who have not been fully updated with changes in the app,1
Coverage is poor compared to other networks,1
"iD Mobile piggybacks on the 3 network. When the services is good, it's very good. Too often, however, when it's poor, it's very poor. Poor signal and slow speeds are not uncommon.",1
Signal is not as good as they like you to believe often 1 or 2 bars only,1
Always liked ID. Still using them.  Change over a bit complicated with mixed emails.   Phone still out if stock with Curry’s.  Don’t like new app,1
I just need to change supplier data and reception is poor 😕 I kept it for the added roaming but when I recently used that was very intermittent.,1
Overall am happy with iD but when there is a problem it is frustrating that it’s so difficult to actually speak to anyone to resolve the issue. In fact it’s impossible.Also as a contract is about to end and it’s possible to upgrade it’s difficult to sort out when conflicting dates and information is given out. Annoying,1
Not a great signal but three to blame for this and need to improve.Don’t like charge for sending pictures via text. Meant to be unlimited and we are paying more for it. OK but could do better.,1
Am finding the service where I can use my phone is limited when I go out of my local area,1
Great service really good internet only reason for 3 stars is that if you got any issues you can't actually speak to a human being I lost my ild number because of this,1
When I log in it goes straight to my wife's account. I can't access my account individually,1
Very poor coverage up in the highlands of Scotland compared to my other contract with EE,1
"Price attracted me, weird mix of very basic app, 90s looking web portal and community support. Queuing to register and login ????? Whats is that about, bill you before sin arrives, PAC transfer problem ( might be my fault ) and est of 5 days for PAC transfer ( Nah mate) seems ridiculous.",1
"If I was writing my review 6 months ago, I'd give them 6 stars if I could. Never an issue, got 5g service before a lot of my friends on other providers, and always got fantastic service. Unfortunately in the last 6 months or so we've had around 3 full day outages, with very little communication by the company on sites such as Twitter, other than a generic 'bear with us'. They've also recently updated their mobile app and customer web portal, which has been a farce to say the least. High wait queue times and very limited availability at the moment. I'm still a customer and hopeful they can turn it around. I also payed off my mobile phone, but they continued to charge me for both my phone and data plan... feel a bit robbed.",1
"The new app is not as good. Before their ""upgrade"" i could add a 5 pound buffer zone which was shock-proof, in case I called a premium number or called abroad. Then it would be taken out of the £5. Now you have to pre-buy a certain number of minutes which I may end up not using . Badly done ID mobile!Also mobile coverage abroad used to be terrible. I only hope it has improved. Even though you were supposed to be able to make calls, it never worked. Let's see if it works in 2024!",1
"Sign up, the phone, price and plan are great.. but god forbid you want to use their app, customer service or view a bill.I have been with ID for around 6 months now, Contacted support on 3 occasions and each time I have had a tragic experience and just cancel the chat without any result. I have had to ask agents if they are real as they are copy and pasting badly from a script that makes no sense.I can barely use the app or website for errors, every bill I have is in symbols and Wingdins font.. I have asked support about this "" we are doing mantinence at the moment thats the issue"" ... then "" it will be fixed at some point"" .The bill to leave them for another provider varys also, some days it is higher and lower than the last.If it works, great. If you need support.. then don't bother. I want to leave.",1
The  company service is excellent. Unfortunately the coverage in YO14 is patchy with message breakup and occasional cutout. Looks like I will need another provider but sorry that this is necessary.,1
"It seems that ID Mobile have recently implemented a queueing system to access their website where you are given an estimated time when you can enter the site. For customers who want to download their invoices each month and for other general use, what a ludicrous means of saving on bandwidth, hence cost, because this is it's purpose. Most customers don't want to have to wait and they deserve better ID Mobile!",1
"Great value, but awful signal in Leeds",1
"I waited six months before writing this review as I took out a great value contract with them on a Google pixel 8. On the plus side the amount of data I get is brilliant and the phone cost was exceptional when factoring the overall price for the duration of my contract.I did carefully check the coverage checker at both my home and work location before ordering the phone but I have been disappointed with the coverage and speed of the connection. In addition I regularly drive on business and the phone does not seem to connect to a 4g or 5g signal easily, instead regularly showing no signal or basic calls. It's not a phone issues as I downloaded a separate Vodafone e sim to test a few long journeys.In summary I guess you get what you pay for, I'm happy with my Google pixel and hope the network improves or they consolidate with another network. If not I will be moving to an alternative network once my contract expires.",1
"Just started with ID mobile DATA  Works ok my iPad Tried to set up account, not easy especially when I put phone  number they sent me in their long winded process doesn’t recognise it, tried twice , so if it continues to work ok re charges etc. Will leave as is",1
"Tried to ""speek"" to someone is like pulling teeth. Why not incorperate your mid contract price hype into the start of the contract.",1
"Very good for data & wi-fi calls over i'net, not good for phone connection, Calls drop out and are difficult to hear. But low cost, so check your coverage for signal.",1
Recommend a friend. I needed to chase my voucher. My friend chased his but months later it still hasn’t been credited.Very disappointing and I won’t be recommending anyone else.,1
"Their website is horrendous, can't find anything. The chat bot is even worse.Their customer service when you eventually get to an agent is okay though, it is a redeeming feature",1
Poor reception in many areas I visit on holiday.,1
"The prices are good, but they take far too long to correct issues with their app and website. Many customers couldn't view their bills for weeks.",1
Really really really bad service. Requested phone number swap. Inputted all correct details online. Advised of day and time for switch. Still nothing. Rang to enquire when switch would occur. Advised it would be by 6pm guaranteed. Still nothing.,1
"I tried to log into the ID app. It asked for my email password. Not my ID password, but my actual email password.",1
"The prices are very appealing but simply put you get what you pay for - I am in London and my signal is simply appalling, especially when in crowded areas. While my partner who is with Sky is getting full bars of 5G I am suffering with one or two bars of 3G. I managed, hence the 3 stars, but I make this as a warning to anyone thinking of signing up.",1
"I live in a small village where the signal can be a bit on and off, I, at times, have to go outside if I need to make a call. When I'm in or closer to the nearest big town it works a lot better thankfully.",1
"Have decided to give a review after 6 months . Firstly signal is ok most of the time with infrequent drop outs .App , used to work and now just sits there looking pretty . The customer service number on the app sends you to curry’s customer support in South Africa , lovely girl, Sadly wrong company.ID mobile customer service (finally caught up with them in somewhere in Africa ) advised me incorrectly that I had to pay roaming charges when it’s clearly written in my contract that I have 30gb within my available data available for Europe .Loose two stars for bad App and false information.Sadly they need to get their excrement together .",1
"I only have 1 bar when at home, when I used to have 4-5 bars when I used to be with EE.",1
"My sim only deal is fab my only complaint is that it doesn’t work when I’m on holiday in Europe ie,… Portugal, turkey, Greece",1
Just visited Durham city and my signal was very poor unable to take calls at one point. Even though the caller kept trying,1
"I was getting charged £19 per month instead of the £15 plan I was on. This happened for most of the year. When I queried it and raised a complaint, I don't feel it was dealt with properly.I feel the plan I am on is very good value, but the extra charges apparently were from Sky, which I don't subscribe too.Also, I still, a couple of months on, haven't had a satisfactory response about my complaint. Disappointed!",1
"Poor signal where I live currently and my old address. It's not IDs fault its three, they used to be my fave network as I was a courier travelling the country and always had a signal, but this last 2 years almost has been annoying.  I'm going to give EE a go in September.",1
"I used to be really happy with the service that ID provided but just recently I've been facing lots of little annoyances. The app is no longer working (I'm unable to update to the new one as it won't let me. I either get a) we're too busy at the moment or b) we're having technical issues.Unfortunately, this means that I can't check my data or usage which is vital as I'm now working away from home and my usage has increased a lot (I switched plans only one month ago from 6GB to 50GB).This isn't really ID's fault but their signal in my new work area isn't great, so I looked around and can get better deals with other providers now so it's a no-brainer.Leaving was very simple though and the PAC code was sent almost immediately.",1
Despite using 3 network I sometimes struggle to get a good connection.Good price and customer service.,1
"I've been with ID mobile for a while, everything runs smoothly and there ha e been no issues. The reason I've only given 3 stars is that I know they now offer better deals than the one I'm on, but have never offered these to me.",1
I was told I would get a £100 voucher when I updated my phone. Still waiting after a week.,1
"Unfortunately signal in my area was very poor. After dealing with customer service, they agreed to let me go to a different provider without having to pay the fee. I am changing my rate from 1 star to 3 stars due to the support received.",1
I have been a customer for many years..maybe loyalty reward perhaps would be great.,1
Normal have no issues. Great network and package but for the last week the App has been out of use. Need to re register on new app and can't. No way of finding my details only by phoning the hotline. Please sort it out!!!!,1
"I’ve been with ID for years and always been happy with service and price but a couple of months ago I lost signal at work, even outside the building, and it caused me no end of problems not being able to contact or be contacted.  It has not resolved so I have been forced to change to a different provider who uses a different network",1
"Don’t like very often having no service, will be changing back to my old provider",1
"I had an account only 2 month and you have changed the login system. The stupid things is to log in, you have to reregister where you ask all the questions that a scammer asks, for example complete password, full name, mobile number etc. My bank only asks partial passwords when they update their system. Partial mobile number etc",1
"Haven't had an issue with my sim nor Internet connection. Obviously it wouldn't work in some areas but overall it's good, sim is affordable and three network too.I'm not happy about the new though. Doesn't tell when my contract is finished and the app wanted me to set up the again even when i regularly open it. Mad. The automated service hasn't got an option to listen to my contract expiry date.",1
"Why do I have to register every time I open the app, it is becoming very annoying.",1
I am waiting for your website to come back online.,1
"FIVE DAYS, YES FIVE DAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT TO MY ACCOUNT",1
"I think you should look after existing customers .I need a new phone but to upgrade is more expensive than if I was a new customer ,think I’ll have to change providers",1
"the Company is fine. the coverage I get in my area (Airedale / Wharfedale) leaves a lot to be desired, and seems to be getting worse over time. I need to use my phone for work, so this needs addressing, and if the Company can't do it, I'll have to move provider.",1
I tried to get in touch with you but system didn't seem to be working. Obviously disappointed,1
Could offer more data for the price in today's market but overall ok.Connection is poor in some locations so limited.,1
There's a lot of time I get cut off in the middle of a call.,1
"I don't get a signal in a lot of places, or signal drops out and I have not network at all, need to rescan only to be told no network available for hours at a time.",1
"Generally, iD does what I need so long as I don't need to go onto the website. I never can get it to recognise my password, and when I tried to change my password yesterday I had to wait 2HOURS for the code to arrive so I never could change my password. This is the second time this has happened. I never can get online by logging in. It's very frustrating",1
Good value but signal not always good. 5G not available or reliable in my area.,1
Have had a number of connection issues since joining. Offered incentive to introduce friends but now only pay after 3 months. No way to speak to anybody. All in all quite disappointing,1
Data connection too slow,1
I have always had excellent experienceHowever I think the fees to cancel my contract are a little excessive as I need to do this due to financial issues,1
Coverage not always great at home.  Very annoying re international service - charges are expensive.,1
At times it will not pick up signal to allow me to browse the Internet....Otherwise I am happy with notifications regarding using sims outside UK.,1
Too expensive,1
Hate it when I am in the middle of doing something and then the phone cuts in.,1
"I've been with ID mobile for many years now.  I am not an avid phone user so overall it meets my basic UK needs.  However, there are a few things that I would love to see fixed.  1),  The biggest problem for me is the extra charges price cap of £25.  This became a problem to me when my mother fell ill overseas.  I maxed out the extra charges while out of the country, and then didnt have any ability to use my phone when I needed it most.  Just to be clear I've always paid on time and as for the extra charges, I would have paid it up front, but there wasn't any way I could do this either.   2) Every time I make an international call I get a text warning me that it is an additional charge.  There doesn't seem to be any way to turn this automatic text message off.   I make an international call every two weeks so its just become an annoyance.   So I've given it 3 stars for these reasons above.  It could be 5 stars otherwise.1/4/24 Edit:  Have discussed with customer service and have been able to increase the price cap, so I'm grateful for that.  The live customer service agent (once i got past the chat bot) was very helpful.  On this note, it was unnecessarily complex.  I was unable to access live chat from the app, having to go out of the app to find the link. Then having to talk to a bot first.   Not ideal, so whilst one problem was solved, due to the barriers and time it took to get through them, I'm leaving the score at 3 stars.",1
Great value for money & not many network problems but very very difficult to communicate with.So all ok once you’ve set up but if you have any problems you cannot speak to anyone only online chats which keep cutting out!,1
"I need a warning if I’m going over my allowance of minutes, messages or gigs please.",1
"It's a nice package, but signal strength seriously limits its usefulness.  I cannot make calls from where I live; many places I go have very poor 4g signal.  If I force my phone to go with 3g, the signal improves for phone calls, but data rates fall significantly, and that is my primary reason for having an ID SIM card.",1
"+ Good network coverage, reasonable price- charged for emojis in texts, app is useless and won’t let me update, I keep asking for PAC and you keep telling me you ran into a problem even though it’s my correct DOB in the correct format",1
No feedback on request to block premium deal alert which are charging £1.50 each time. I did not knowingly apply for these text and impossible to stop so reduced capped to nil. Need to make calls to Jersey but can’t till sure not being charged.,1
"Updated app is poor upgrade. Slow to progress through pages the 'Oops something went wrong. try again"" message occurs multiple times. The old app was fine and the mobile service was good.",1
Not always good reception in the Hampshire New Forest District....,1
"Experience with IDI am more than happy with the app, is quite easy to use.I have just updated the ID app and now not able to bring up live chat.Being a pensioner I just wish that I could actually speak to somebody and not just message.  It would be nice to have human contact.I appreciate you asking for my feedback",1
good value package inc roaming but unfortunately poor signal at home & poor customer service when raising issues,1
"Overall ok, but not reliable.",1
It draws you in as seems cheap but doesn't include alot of things my previous provider did so I find I have to be careful how and what I use on my phone now as sometimes my bill is more expensive than my last provider and I'll be honest I'm not sure I'll continue with I'd.,1
Data connection very poor generally. All very well offering high GB's of data with plans but if the connection is poor what's the point?,1
The sims cheap. But often i cant get internet outside. Am going to end my contact.,1
Poor internet coverage .sometimes nothing at all.Happens all the time,1
Difficult to actually talk to someone at ID,1
negative - you can never speak to anyonepositive - it's fairly cheap,1
"I have struggled when trying  to use my phone abroad .... can't make calls except via WhatsApp when Internet is availablepppp. The phone says it is ready to go, but I never receive a welcome text when I cross boarders.",1
Hard to contact if your query does not fit the categories you allow,1
"Generally very happy with the service but wanted to transfer my now older son's account to his own name but can't without losing his number, which he doesn't want to do. As a consequence, will probably have to leave at some point. What a shame.",1
Signal often 1/2 bars and poor quality,1
Customer service is terrible as unable to talk to an agent,1
Single strength in house week compared to EE and vodaphone only 1 bar,1
When there is a problem there is no telephone number where you can speak to a member of staff. It is all online. It would be nice to have more person to person contact.,1
"The signal can be hit and miss, especially when it rains at home....",1
"The company offers competitive prices to start with, which is good. However, the price increases annually and I started off paying £23 a month and I am now paying £27.30 a month. As a student I would prefer to be with a network that will keep my price the same for the duration of my contract. Therefore, when my contract is up I will be switching to a provider such as VOXI or Asda Mobile who do not have mid-conract price rises.",1
Mobile coverage often not good.Europe free roaming good but difficult to detail the actual free coverage area when on holidayAdvance warning before charges would be good.,1
Would prefer to be able to deal with you by phone,1
The cost is very competitive but the coverage isn’t always as good as it could be.,1
"They're customer service is amazing however the actual service, is stupid. When they have planned work in the area, they don't message to let you know (my son has cardiac conditions and on the day the network was down, I couldnt phone the cardiac department from the phone, thankfully we have the landline). Its took more than 4 days to apply a new contract that I still havent had applied to my sim so I'm not too impressed and there is never anyone to actually speak to, it's all via chat which isnt too bad sometimes but sometimes you just need to speak to an actual person, Hoping I get my contract sorted soon as I've been told 2 different dates now. This isn't the first time I've been told different dates either, I was told 2 different billing dates at the start of my first contract with them and had to chase it up.",1
"Ok company with cheap price, yet the data coverage in London is abysmal. You see « 4g » yet you have no internet!",1
"It’s ok.Positive: it’s a virtual operator.  Nice app to manage account.Negative: cost of extras, ie sending pictures in text messages.  Increase monthly payments every April to maximise their profits.  Hoping this is made illegal soon as its not a fair policy for customers who are on a fixed contract term.",1
I have 3 phone contracts but only one email address so I can only communicate about 1 phone. I have tried to solve this problem by using live chat which is absolutely useless. They really need a phone number so you can talk to someone,1
Quite a lot of the time I am unable to get a signal.,1
"Mithers the life out of you with emails most days. The 99° UK network coverage boasted by Three is great, unfortunately I seem to be always in the 1° area no matter where I am. Very dissapointed.",1
I live in West Cornwall but 3 coverage is I’m afraid poor.I am missing phone calls-my son in Sussex often cannot reach me. Internet is difficult to get in many areas where I would like it. No problem with the actual phone though.Had no issues with previous provider.,1
Dislike nothing about the service but very disappointed not to have received the voucher I and my husband were promised as he introduced me to id mobile months ago. Currently neither of us has received the promised Curry's vouchers,1
Unable to communicate with a human! You have docked my usage even though I have not used the monthly quota.Coverage is poor in comparison to other networks only plus is the plan is cheap,1
Normal use in UK is great with good coverage at a reasonable price. Do not appreciate being charged for texts to Europe and Roaming is prohibitive with Switzerland excluded from plan.,1
"Price is excellent. But internet is unreliable - often down for seconds or minutes at a time, which is very frustrating",1
"I have been with ID for just over six months on a SIM only contract, I have no issue with this service and would recomend them for value and ease of use of their APP. My issue was when I decided to migrate to a 24mth phone contract, I contacted their online agents and after some security checks they confirmed that I could upgrade to the deal I had seen on line. I recieved a phone call directly from them to set the contract up, after all the usual passing over of details the end result was that I did not qualify for the deal because of a financial reason.This is very strange as my credit score is very excellent, they asked if I would consider a cheaper phone and then they might be able to help, this i declined. I went straight to the Apple UK site oredered my phone over 24mths interest free with no issue, very strange how they ID have lost a sale when I know I have no issue getting credit elsewhere.I will still be keeping my ID SIM but just annoying that I couldn't get the phone that I wanted from them.",1
So far so good need ask me 6 months time,1
Price is spot on but I don't get very good WiFi when I'm at my caravan in northumberland sometimes we have no WiFi all weekend which is not good,1
Very reasonably priced but reception is shocking. Have moved from a larger more known provider and have seen a significant drop in coverage for both phone and data. So frustrating!,1
"I like the online app and the fact you can monitor your usage. The monthly spend is competitive and there are no roaming charges when visiting other countries … I love that! The only downside is the internet connection which is not always good … I’m often looking at 1 or 2 bars when I’m out and need my mobile. This could be improved as it’s non-existent, most of the time, in my area.",1
"I am not happy with 3 network, it goes down regular! We will be losing our landlines soon, so I will be relying on my mobiles network! I need a reliable network for people to contact me.",1
Good service and very cheap to use in the UK but no package to be able to use in Turkey or outside Europe. Would really appreciate economical package to be able to add on to use when away (out of Europe),1
Do not like extra charges for multimedia messages,1
"Reasonably priced, good value sim only contracts for my husband and I; but disappointing customer service.  My husband's contract included £45 worth of Amazon gift vouchers 3 months after taking out the contract.  We have not received these vouchers and have not received a reply to a form we completed saying we hadn't received them, nor to an email we followed this up with when we didn't get a response.  Still waiting to hear back.Update:  Following on from iD's response to this review, we have now received our vouchers.  Also, my contract came to an end and I have upgraded it to an even better deal - 100GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts, sim only, for the same price as the old contract, £10 per month.  Excellent value.",1
"Had a smooth transition from Three to iD Mobile, keeping my old number. No issues at all. Downloaded the app and that all worked fine. Logged on in web browser and downloaded a statement. Also easy and trouble-free. All good.August 2024 update:I took out an Id Mobile contract after following a link on their web site and receiving an email promising a £30 amazon gift card. After 90 days, no gift. After chasing it via their agent (Giftcloud) and providing copious evidence, I finally get told ""the ID mobile team has declined the issuance of the reward for your sign up"". No explanation or reason given. Basically I was scammed into taking out a contract.",1
I do not get a signal at home I have to go outside to get text messages,1
The strength of signal in my area deteriorated last week. In some areas cants connect.,1
4G is very poor,1
I wish the coverage was better but apart from that I can't fault ID mobile so far as my bills represent good value for money and haven't been raised.  I haven't had to contact them so the rating doesn't reflect dealing with customer services.  I am now reducing by 1 star as their login process has changed - now a multi-click process instead of 1 which uses Google Recaptcha.  I have serious concerns for my privacy with sites that use this.,1
i cannot get a signal in some areas in my house,1
When I took out my contract at £43 pm within 1 week you could get it for £34,1
Generally the phone service seems to be not so good where I live but people using say EE have much better reception.,1
"The network used to be really good now all I get is poor reception, Internet slow, videos buffering. 3 bars at most for majority of the time but the mobile data is pretty dire!! Looking to switch.",1
I think you provide a good service cheep and good service,1
"Cheap and cheerful but many, more than a third, phone calls have delayed sound, sometimes up to a 10 second delay which makes the call impossible",1
"Difficult when having more than one account, identifying which is which can be difficultGood prices, perfect for children",1
Setting up took ages as I am a disabled user. The gentle at  the counter in curry’s was gracious and helpful.I struggled to get on live chat and searched unsuccessfully for a phone number to aid.  I took me four days before a relative could sort it out for me.,1
"I love ID usually. However was not happy when bought daughter phone and contract in Aug 22. Discussed cost of various phones at length with agent, because couldnt afford too much but was 18th birthday present. He never advised me that cost would go up with RPI in april so it went from £29 to £34 within7 months andno doubt will go up again this april. Next time i get phone with contract, im going to tesco mobile where price is same for length of CONTRACT because it is a CONTRACT so in my opinion should stay same price",1
"I did not realise I could not send emojis without incurring charges, this is a habit difficult to stop and I keep incurring charges. It seems rude you can't just send a heart for free!",1
"I've just moved from EE to iD. I'm really quite unsure. I went for them because they were recommended on Money Savings Expert. My new sim came through as expected and porting seemed to go fine. However, my phone insisted on retaining the original number of the sim rather than the new number.  That's when things got a bit flaky. Firstly, it's difficult to get through to a human being, they expect everything to be done by bot but their bot didn't understand my problem. The only solution is to go through ""cancel contract"" options. They said that they woudl send out a new sim. I checked that this would have my ported number and they confirmed so. It arrived, I put it in my phone; I switched the phone off and on. Nothing. No signal. I could now enter the correct number in the phone settings but then had to change back to the original sim to get any signal and make calls.Then I sent a web link to my wife and immediately received a text from iD to say that any MMS messages sent would be charged at 55p per message! So if you send someone a picture; a video; an audio message, iD will charge you 55p. Now I understand why the up front price is low...the gauge you elsewhere.I'll see what else the hit me with but I'm half way out the door with them.Then I've had a number of instances where I can hear the person's voice I was calling but they could not hear me.Finally, the reception is quite poor compared to my previous provider.",1
Not always a great reception. There have been occasions when an error alert came up which made no sense. The network also affects the s21 samsung mobile.,1
Trying to actually talk to someone in customer services is a nightmare.,1
"Usually good, but too many outages recently",1
"WOULS SIAN FROM ID WHO REPLIED TO MY LAST REVIEW PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN REPLY TO HER, THANKS.",1
The signal strength (Three Mobile)  is not good generally - EE signal much better...,1
Telephone service has been unavailable over the last few days.,1
When you sign on and have to change your existing account you need to have the telephone number of the new telephone number with you up front and with you. You don't provide that immediacy.,1
my signal is not always good and in west sleek burn in Scotland it does not work at all,1
Very poor customer service. Difficult to get any problem sorted. But generally good network coverage.,1
Good flexible account but customer service poor.,1
"I THOUGHT I WAS UPGRADING MY SIM ONLY DEAL,IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WENT THROUGH AS A NEW DEAL, SO NOW I AM PAYING 2 LOTS OF D/D, AND I ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO MY OLD A/C, THESE PEOPLE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH, WHEN I FINALLY DID, THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR CANCELLING THE NEW CONTRACT, UNBELIEVABLE,",1
I like ID but was unhappy that I couldn’t keep my old ID number when I changed online to a cheaper package with ID,1
I was with IDmobile for a quite a while which I really  enjoyed their data roll over.  But recently they are having network issues with the connection which was dropping on daily basis so I decided to switch to a different network.,1
"In the short time I've had this contract after moving from EE the ID Mobile service has been lost, while you have no service or Internet on your phone your also unable to contact support via there App on someone else's phone on another network,The network needs to be improved, in 10 years I've been with Orange then EE I can remember only 1 time I had no service due to a network issueIn 3 months ID mobile has been down twice and its a day long issueWe need another way to contact ID Mobile support when the service goes offline even if its just a recorded message to say why its gone down yet againOther than that when it works its greatAll we ask if for better support",1
Great for paying cheaper prices for newer phones but the connection is shocking I never have connection I'm never able to ring out or anything despite having unlimited texts call and data,1
"Generally good.Would like to see an insurance option. I keep breaking phones, or phones let me down outside of the warranty conditions and I  have to complete the contract with another phone I've had to buy.Also I'm left high and dry with unlimited data that doesn't work in the USA.I'd like to see multiple phone number contract concessions for those with several dependants using phones and contracts I'm paying for.",1
Not possible to talk to any staff member only idiotic robot,1
I can't always connect to Internet with my data and sometimes i cant send messages especially to certain number (my granddaughter) very often it says no network connection I wouldn't recommend id mobile sorry,1
"The one thing every customer service department should have is a telephone contact number, using the only way to contact ID mobile is by chat ,which is not acceptable.",1
"I love the tariff. I love the communication about the bill's. I have given 3 stars as our signal is appalling when at home. My husband even bought a new phone in case that was the problem but still the sameI am not sure if it is ID mobile's fault, but there is no way of knowing.  People visiting with other networks have no problem.",1
"Very variable phone cover. Keep getting cut off with ""You are not allowed to call this number"".",1
"Network reception is poor, struggle to send messages quiet a lot of the time.",1
Good monthly charge but signal strength/line speed in our location poor.,1
Coverage is quite limited in many areas that are not remote,1
"Signal is not the best in places keeps dropping out, never had this issue with Vodafone , can be very annoying",1
"I have only gone on line to buy a mobile phone because of the closure of Carphone Warehouse, they were brilliant at sorting my phone deals out and any problems I had.  I cannot easily navigate the ID website and feel there is too much emphasis on information for new customers and not enough guidance for existing customers. I attempted to get a sim only deal as I liked my phone. I wanted to seamlessly carry on with my old number etc.  However somehow I got it wrong.  Eventually after a very anxious hour of trying to find out how to sort the mistake out as I had ended up with two contracts I found a way to get a telephone number to actually speak to someone and registered myself as a vulnerable customer.  Since then I feel so much happier using the service. They helped me with all the difficulties I was experiencing. I am over 70",1
"Coverage over quality.I've been using ID mobile for many years and I have always been on their SIM only monthly rolling contract deals - I have always found them very competitive throughout the years with really good upgrade opportunities.It's been so easy to change my deals, set limits and even order a new SIM - all trough the app. Great experience there, nothing to complain about.Data rollover was genuinely my favourite thing when I first got my SIM with ID. Amazing feature, love it, I would hate to lose it.For voice only I have rarely had issues even in rural Wales - I've had decent coverage & been able to make phone calls and have always thought that the network coverage was adequate. Good stuff.However the 4G and 5G infrastructure is seriously lacking in areas with high traffic, for example - Cardiff city centre - it takes me one minute to load a web page (5G, full signal). Cardiff Albany road, further out of the city centre in a less congested area (5G, full signal) - still the same, cannot even text in WhatsApp.For about a year or two I have been blaming my dated Samsung galaxy S10 plus (I was on 4G). However I just got a brand new Samsung galaxy s23 plus and I have already replaced my SIM card (just in case) and I am still facing the same problems... Getting stuck in the middle of town trying to get a taxi home, with full 5G signal and no internet was the straw that broke the camels back.What good is a high internet allowance with rollower if I can't even use it when it is most needed?It's time to switch, reluctantly...",1
Would like an option to purchase international call and data for countries not in the roaming group. Or increase maximum credit limit of £30.,1
I find that coming over from EE to ID has proven to be a mistake EE COVERAGE  I find is better but I will give it a couple of months then reacess the situation,1
"I’m disappointed on how long it takes the complaints team to answer the phone it’s like they only have a few people working and when it comes to network issues in the area they are very evasive and difficult to deal with when it comes to offering any form of credit without me mentioning it directly or them saying they will call me back the next day, only for nothing to happen for it to have to go to deadlock and then having to wait another 10 to 14 days for it to be decided despite their being evidence of an issue that’s clearly not going to be resolved in a timely manor the Complaints procedure needs to be modernised so each individual Complaints handlers has the Access and authority so the Complaint does not go from person to person and complaint to deadlock despite the resolution originally being agreed but not actioned on account",1
"I was recently told by BT that they offer a similar package for just under £8 per month - that is, almost £5 less a month than I pay ID Mobile.I wonder if I should be renewing my contract.",1
"Whilst the actual contract is fantastic value for money, unfortunately reception in my area - Woodley Reading - rarely jumps above 2 bars. Occasionally on my local travels, call drop off happens - (Samsung S21Ultra)",1
I am a 89 year old pensioner trying to take to a real person to dicuss my monthly bill. I have phoned on many occasions but unfortunately get referred to a computer. I don't have one and I have had no help. Please consider the older people.,1
"Signal not so great. Even though the coverage checker showed great coverage indoor and out, I'm lucky to get 2 bars but it's usually 1 or none with calls breaking up. Wifi calling is hit and miss also.",1
"I find the indoor reception is a bit hit and miss where I live and work and the coverage can be a bit sketchy at times. The flip side is when there is a good 5g connection, I have seen speeds up to 700Mbps.",1
Dislike variable billing dates. Need to stick to the same date every month.,1
Good service whilst the contract is running but impossible to contact the company if you have any queries or need to cancel.,1
The app constantly plays up. Can’t download bills again.Otherwise I’m really happy with the service.Gone on the desktop site and all I get is a blank screen!,1
The price is amazing and the fact that it is a one month rolling contract means I know I can cancel at anytime should I wish.I do find though that the coverage is not always as good on other networks.,1
It is difficult to understand data usage  and where data is used before finding that extra charges are charged.,1
Difficulty in making contact to discuss issues or resolve problems,1
I was on a Cruise from the 17th December 2023 to 29thDecember 2023...I was unable to use my phone 🤳.... but I have just been told that my next bill will be £97 ...... For What,1
Your network is poor where I live also l can't talk to your customer service regarding problems,1
Account access should be easier. Better guidance on charges when outside of the EU.,1
The fact that we can't speak to an anyone directly can make things very difficult at times,1
"Using PayG system is very flakey.Every few days the network simply stops working. Can't text or call because I'm ""out of credit"" and the app won't let me login due to a technical error.Once it's working again, I can see that I am definitely not out of credit.Other than that, it's a good experience.Please fix",1
I don’t like the fact that the price rises during the time of the contract- I’d like to know how this is justified.,1
I dislike that I was mis sold a phone last year that I have never used and was not allowed to return. I can't wait for my contract to end somi can go elsewhere and get decent customer service.,1
Difficulty in accessing internet when out and about.,1
"Confusing website and “chat” option.  Wrong phone number notification for SIM card, sent twice.  A lot of my time wasted.",1
"This review relates to the refer a friend scheme only, overall with the rest of the ID mobile,  I've had no problems.The refer a friend scheme seems designed to make sure you don't get the referral monies, unless you have the time and persistence. It starts well that you get a link to use to instigate the referral. Other companies then use this link to track and pay the bonus, but not ID mobile.The first step is the referred person needs to make contact to enter the  account number within 14 days. (Hurdle 1)Then you need to remember 90 days later that you referred someone as the money is not credited automatically. If you manage to remember then after a live chat your be told that the other person, either the referrer or referee needs to make contact first as well.  (Hurdle 2).The other person then makes contact and that seems to unlock some blocker on the referee account. (Hurdle 3).Then the referee has to make contact again to again request the bonus is paid (Hurdle 4).You are then told that for the other person to get their bonus they have to make contact again. (Hurdle 5).If you have read this review to this point - you are probably someone who might get the bonus, you have persistence!I queried the process and was sent terms and conditions of the scheme, it may say that you have to take all these steps (it just feels like they are there to thwart issuing the bonus), but in summary won't be referring anyone else - the process is just unnecessarily too time consuming and complicated.",1
"My phone is always cutting off, and my WYFY is rubbish.I could not find a number to ring only a live chat, which I phoned. That day my phone was cutting off every phone call.",1
"The transfer process was traumatic. I was never sure whether I had retained my mobile number.  I was not sure of where I was in the transfer process. Given a choice of transfer date, I chose the earliest date given. Perhaps obvious, my existing supplier stopped my mobile service at 5 pm on that day. But my new SIM card from ID had not arrived by that day. So I had no mobile connection. I contacted iD by chat, and was advised to go to Currys and they would provide a new SIM card and activate it. They installed it but said Currys is not enabled to activate it. I had to find the a way forward on getting home - not aware if where I was in the transfer process. But they were helpful and knowledgeable thankfully, and sorted it. The original new SIM card arrived a day later by post - two days after the transfer date.May I suggest:A road map of progress and actions required.Fewer unco-ordinated and confusing emails in the transfer process.Early reassurance that the original mobile number has definitely been retained.Longer allowance for SIM card delivery by post in regard to the transfer date.Less direction to the chat line and easier access to the helpline people.But there have been no problems with the service since.",1
"I have been with ID for a couple of years and the reception is good so I ordered an upgrade. This never turned up. DPD delivered the phone to the incorrect address and 4 weeks later I still don't have a phone because ID customer services are difficult to get hold of and non-productive. Once you do get through, just passing the blade to DPD I find a customer service process very poor.",1
"The price is good, but the service range is poor and I can't access the internet using roaming when I am out and about.",1
"Don't know if this is an iD Mobile issue, but every so often (sometimes very often) 4G stops working and the only way to get it back is to restart my phone. Generally good coverage for where I go.",1
All was well until last night when I could not get the app to load up.On checking my bill it looks like both mine and my husbands have a computer malfunction just symbols all over the pages making the bill unreadable.Such a shame as I was very happy until this.,1
"Very reasonable pricing but not great coverage.I frequently seem to be unable to connect to a mobile signal, which is a nuisance. On the other hand, I really appreciate that at the moment at least it is possible to use my phone in Europe without extra changes.",1
"What I would like to see: Helpful people, cheerful people good thoughts from authorities for older people and then action. Politicians to be thinking of how to aid society and then do it, and not just about their income. Lowering of prices and expenses for older people.",1
When I'm out in Spain it doesn't switch automatically to data. I have to switch the phone off then on to get connected.,1
I can’t get a good signal in my home and have to rely on Wi-Fi to make calls. Very disappointing to pay for service which doesn’t work properly at my home address,1
"Nice to receive an email telling me my bill is available online. Would be even better if the link worked...do these coders EVER check their work? This follows on from iOS not being able to read their pdf files. OK - that was an Apple issue but, with the number of iPhones in circulation, I'd have liked to have been advised of the problem by iD Mobile proactively...",1
Speaking to a person would be much better than live chat,1
"When ever I am abroad, I can't send a photograph by messenger or by my e mails. It was ok on WhatsApp App but my son doesn't have that, so was unable to be in touch as much as I would have liked. Hard getting through on the fone to, so had to keep using my husbands fone. Very disappointed.",1
"Signal on both phone and Internet not great in my area, I have to rely on WiFi calling. We do live in a dip which doesn't help, however I am moving soon to a much better signal area 😊",1
Whilst I appreciate the tariff I pay is low I find it frustrating that very often I can't get a signal on my phone. I have missed many important calls and messages because of this.,1
I like the amount of texts and phone call times allowed.  I dont like the fact that i cant talk to someone in person for assistance.  I dont like doing everything online.  I dont understand how to talk to someone about whether i can pay a one off extra package while on holiday in south africa so that i am able to use my sim only account when away.,1
Unfortunately your network is not as good as it was before. Found that I'm not getting good reception from my home which never was an issue at the beginning.,1
"Certain phone numbers are not supported (which I didn't realise) and I got cut off whilst talking to my insurance company.Several texts say 'undelivered' but are actually delivered, so I'm never sure.It's very cheap.",1
Why 3 stars? Great value for money but... awful speed. Shows 4G/5G... 3-4 Mbps.Rollover data is meaningless as you just can't use the data because of low speed.,1
"The low cost of ID's SIM-only deals is great, as well as not being locked into a contract. These reasons would lead me to give ID 5 stars, but I've only given 3 stars because if you have a problem, you can never speak to a real person and for that reason I be would only give their customer 1 star.",1
To many hidden cost that are not mentioned when taking the contract. Bill is always £14/15 pound that’s 40% higher that contract!!!,1
"They do not keep bugging you with promotions, they are reasonably priced for the services they provide, but could do better with roaming charges and explanations. Overall a reasonable company to deal with.",1
"Purely online customer service is not ideal. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Thank you for your response to this review, giving me additional ways of contacting you, albeit online.",1
I may need to change from ID Mobile because the reception is unreliable at home.,1
Good phone and network service. Very dissatisfied with customer service when device fault found at contract renewal. This will prompt me to look at alternative providers at next renewal.,1
We constantly have connection issues at home with poor signal quality and calls dropping in and out. We are equi distant from 2 masts and I think the issue is that we keep flipping between masts on where we are in the house,1
"The upside is brilliant priced packages which are very competitive. However, the downside is bad customer care, basically stemming from the fact that it is almost impossible to get through to you when you have an issue, having to queue endlessly on a chat box. If you can resolve that I would definitely give you 5 stars!",1
"It’s just that I have poor reception from my home with this new provider, only one bar.",1
Loyalty is a thing of the past we get nothing for staying with the same company.Mobile from Curry's as you will know but the price advertised was only for new customers but not advertised as so. Had to get the lesser Mobile I went in for because of monthly payments.So this is surely under the trade description act. Other then that quite content.,1
You need to make it easier to obtain a PAC code.,1
"I am having problems with the app. I am a returning customer and it hasnt work since I returned, I have deleted and reloaded but still it wont work.",1
better coverage required and less false coverage indicators published. Coverage shows excellent on site but barely one bar in reality.,1
I have no issues in any customer service I have had.Sometimes I can not get any signal which is annoying.,1
The reception is okayBut to get any help or assistance is virtually IMPOSSIBLE,1
"Great service, info & app but coverage via 3 is rather limited. It often falls particularly when driving when using goigle maps.",1
"Instead of bombarding your customers with emails, you might like to invest in human customer service. A phone number that is quickly answered by a human.",1
I found it so difficult to change my plan & got so stressed you do not take into account the old & vunerable. I did evenually get to speak to someone. I would suggest that you arrange a better system,1
The 5G coverage appears to be good as it seems to be accessible in a number of places but data drops out consistently,1
Rarely get a signal and unless I am in a town or city never get internet don’t think I will be staying with ID,1
The network is not good sometimes I can't send message and sometimes voice calls are not proper it cuts off during the conversation.,1
Very poor connection. Sometimes when on a call line breaks up or totally disconnects the call.,1
My signal has never been more than 2.5barsThis was much lower than when I checked what this would be prior to switching to id mobile from EE. I have tried to raise a complaint but this requires so many passwords and PIN numbers either by phone or onlineYou need to look into this for me,1
Have tried without success since November to change to sim only for 12 pound per month. Have received order number 130679568. But still no response. My wife is now on the plan I requested. Iam still being charged 37. 87. Which is not Good Enough.Please Sort this out ASAP.,1
"iD misspelt my name. I contacted iD chatline and asked the iD rep to change the first letter of my first name from a W to Y.  My first name begins with a Y.  I spent over 3hrs on the chatline - the iD rep requested a copy of my passport, bills with my name on it etc. Which I could not give because I was not at home.   iD had already taken a direct debit payment from my bank account which of course had my correct name.  After 3 hrs the iD rep said she/he had corrected my name but in fact she/he lied as it has not been corrected.",1
"The product is a good one, but the lack of direct customer service ( I.e it is difficult to talk to a real person ) is off putting",1
ID Mobile provides a great value package but this comes at a price... for any issues getting hold of a person via chat or phone is nearly impossible. Your only option for a result is using the group conversations and someone providing an answer.,1
Great price but expect terrible customer service. You get what you pay for.,1
Positives. Easy to set up and Id keep me informed and I like the rolling data ideaNegatives poor reception at home and outside,1
"Signal coverage isn't great, at times can't make phone calls, no signal coverage",1
"Very intermittent and poor signal in my area, so check carefully and do not beleive the signal maps. Impossoble to cancel contract so stuck",1
When I want a query there is no one on ID side. You get some one to answer on the PC or the phone screen.I need to speak to some one in person.Very disappointed.,1
"I can't remember a recent experience??Good:However, im very happy with my and my daughters plan.Bad:Wish it was easier to talk or communicate with somebody.",1
I don't like that you are not able to speak to anyone on the telephone. I had an issue and I was never able to get it resolved.,1
Good contract deals available.New phone arrived promptly. No instructions at all on how to transfer data from old Samsung mobile to new. No chance of speaking to a live person about anything. They just leave you to it!,1
"There is no easy way to contact ID Mobile so I shall continue to share my experiences with this, wider audience. Having been invited to download a pdf version of my monthly bill I received 4 pages of complete gibberish....It might be easy to solve if only I could speak to a human being...",1
Changed from Three because cheaper and discovered network coverage not as good. V disappointing as I travel constantly in the Uk but you get what you pay for.,1
"I wasn't happy with my new contract,,I was promised unlimited tex ,calls but most of all unlimited data, the person I was dealing with said I would get it ,,cause at the time contract said just 10gigs data ,he said he could change it ,,I have now uped payments £23 a month to get the unlimited data .its a lot for me  ,I'm  74 no Internet in my flat",1
I’m going off the id mobile because the network is very bad I don’t get reception from my mobile phone in any big building I am looking for new network,1
"SIM seems to work fine, stuck in endless customer feedback loop attempting to set up app or account, which sucks massively...Lack of customer service is an issue.",1
I dislike the means by which I recover voice messages.,1
"Can't fault the phone for service, no problems experianced but to be charged more per month than is available for a recent model is unacceptable and i will not be renewing my contract in May 2024",1
Sitting here with 5g 4 bars and can't do nothing do anything with phone,1
Ever since I changed to id mobile i keep losing signal and I have to keep turning phone off and on to get it back I'd used to be good but not now ready to change network.,1
The Problem with your Company there’s not a Customer Service number I can phone up and speak directly to resolve any problems not chat lines or Iartificial intelligence.,1
The only problem I have is contacting someone.  I want to have a SIM only and not change my phone. It seemed my best option was to go to Curry's but there was such a queue of unhappy people I could not wait.,1
Ultimately a real person had to intervene to get the update I wanted to install correctly. On your auto system I ended up installing same deal twice. The help person who installed update about 10days ago didn't fully install as screens didn't appear on my phone to complete. So I thought it was fixed but it wasn't. I sent 3 emails asking for clarification of what was meant to be happening without response.,1
Okay but only average. Reception patchy.,1
I make comparatively little use of my phone. I simply get the service that I pay for.,1
"loyalty penalised !transferred my wife's account from id mobile to O2 recently. while I'm happy with I'd mobile, I could not get an upgrade phone for the same price as a new customer. the phone I was going to get from id mobile was only available to new customers and was quite a bit more expensive for existing customers .... so my wife became a new customer to O2 and cancelled Id mobile contract.would have been happy to stay with I'd mobile had the upgrade deal been the same as new customer deal.when my own contract is up I will probably also change supplier, should Id mobile still be penalising existing customers!",1
I had issues when upgrading my new mobile.You tried to charge me for the new phone and the old one.It took 5 phone calls to sort it out and was only sorted after I went through the complaints procedure. I was told numerous times someone would phone me back but they never did,1
Actual signal strength is well below that was suggested on checks done before I chose ID network. Low or NO signal at many locations I am at regularly.,1
Our SIM only deal is great for price but it is hit and miss for phone and internet coverage in our area near Dumbarton.Works great in the cities but on the outskirts too many times unable to access the internet or even make a phone call.,1
It has a great easy to use app with all the features like WiFi calling VoLTE etc. Unfortunately it has no 5g signal in Northern Ireland  and I'm having low to zero signal in a lot of areas I frequent . I have my pac code,1
"My husband and I both switched to ID mobile and whilst signal service abroad is great and included in our packages, the signal coverage for both of us in North Staffordshire is very poor. Particularly Trentham area and from Junction 15 to 19 on the M6, especially around Junction 16",1
Having used ID mobile for nine months now the reception is not always good especially at home.Also the monthly cost has soared more than expected.,1
Haven't been with you long enough to form an  opinion yet.Going abroad  soon so I'll wait and see how goodyour roaming is.,1
"I find the signal quite weak at times, it is very frustrating, I am considering changing",1
"I bought a new phone with a 24 month contract on iD Mobile on Black Friday. The SIM card doesn't work and when I try to register for an iD Mobile account online it says I have the incorrect details.  I spent several hours on the live chat trying to rectify the problem only to be told that my information does not match the details associated with the new number provided iD Mobile as part of the contract. Now iD refuse to help because they say I am not the account holder. Instead they told me to go back to Carphone Warehouse where I purchased the offer.My details on the Carphone Warehouse systems are correct but they claim they cannot do anything to help despite both iD Mobile and Carphone Warehouse being owned by Currys.After calling the complaints team at iD Mobile I was again told I wasn't the account holder and to email my account details and a copy of my ID to them.  I did this immediately and it took over 48 hours for them to reply that the details I gave them are incorrect or incomplete.  They asked for my iD Mobile customer PIN which I do not know because I cannot register for an online account and the name of my bank. I am still waiting for a response.I am concerned about my personal data and have reservations about using a company that can make such a big mistake without offering adequate customer service.  I'm now stuck paying for a SIM  card I cannot use on a contract that I cannot cancel! I  am also worried about how iD Mobile is handling my  personal data as this appears to be a pretty big breach.At this point I wouldn't recommend iD Mobile to anybody, from my experience the lower prices donot make up for the hassle and the stress.Update (15/12/2023): This issue has now finally been resolved by the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile. It has been a stressful couple of weeks and I feel that no customer should have to deal with the problems I have encountered, especially when the original issue was caused through no fault of my own.  I feel there is a lesson to be learned here for the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that communication between the two companies needs to be improved.Having said that, I would hope that the issue that I encountered was out of the ordinary and eventually I did manage to contact representatives from the Carphone Warehouse and iD Mobile that were able to help me and provided a level of customer service that I would expect from a big company.  It's just a shame that this didn't happen in the first place.",1
My daughter arranged my account with you because of value for money .Unfortunately the reception in my house is only one bar on my phone which is poor,1
Keeps notifying me of voicemail that does not exist,1
"I feel that I got a very fair and good deal from iD mobile and I would have given 5 stars, but I've been waiting months for my promised £30 voucher, which was part of the deal, when I took out the contract. Having messaged the customer services twice, from the follow up emails, which I receive from them, I still haven't had a reply, or my £30 voucher. Their customer services is something which needs to be improved, even when trying to set up your phone as a new customer. If a company offers something as part of a special deal, they should honour it. There is nobody to talk to. Other than those problems, it all seems to work ok.",1
Lousy signal at home CA1 3TW embarrassing.,1
Lack of service without communicationPoor coverage,1
Seems a good deal then price goes up quite a bit..,1
Currys assistants were very helpful and I think the deal I got on the Pixel 7 Pro was very good.My critism is the fact that the phone signal when at home is very poor. Usually no more than 1 bar and often no signal at all.,1
"The help chat is very painful to use. The prices are good and the coverage is great thoThank you for the reply, interesting that you assume I have had trouble connecting someone on live chat, that's not the case. I was able to contact someone, but they were not able to resolve my issue, only able to half answer my problem",1
"Cant get into my account, you’ve got the wrong number for my phone",1
Price ok but new customers get a better deal and signal not the greatest  looking into moving,1
"Signal not greatI struggle to get more than a single bar of 5G reception fairly frequently even though before signing up with ID, I checked coverage and it was supposed to be fine. If I had known then what I knew now, I may not have signed with ID.",1
"Good service and signal in most areas. Had quite a delay retrieving my original phone number, approximately 2 weeks and began to worry if I'd made the right decision. This finally got sorted and all is well now",1
I was without my phone due no network signal for a day could not use the app and got no help using the bot,1
Did not have any service last Saturday and Sunday.Very disappointing.,1
I like the prompts given when using chargeable calls or messages- but not so happy with the internet connections.,1
"I am disappointed with the lack of coverage by the network which I've not experienced with O2, BT or EE",1
Signal strength is not what I expected. I seem to be getting a lot of dropped calls and poor signal when out about and wanting to use the internet.,1
Pros:  no problem its a mobile network.Cons: It's a 5G network but not available on all 5G handsets. My Nokia G50 (5G) phone is not supported.,1
"I cancelled my sim only contract to start another contract with a new phone.Unfortunately the sim only contract was never cancelled & I have been paying both for the last 3 months.I've had quite an ordeal to get my money back. It was an upsetting time as I am a pensioner & truly cannot afford to lose this money, through no fault of my own. They agreed finally to end the sim only contract & refund the money. But only after a long upsetting struggle. One that I didn't need at the moment",1
"I sign a new deal for £4:48 per month, within 2 months it went up to £8No read why and no notice given either",1
"Having written a 5* review 2 days ago, today the ID mobile network has been  unavailable, with no notification or information available unless I go hunting for it. At first I thought my phone was faulty and spent time trying to reset it!This is the first negative experience I've had with them. I accept that networks will at times experience technical problems, but this has been a full day now, and ID mobile should have attempted to notify customers - at the very least they could have emailed us. Even on their website updated information is sadly lacking.",1
"As of yesterday, I cannot connected to mobile data, have been trying constantly all day today and yesterday, that's why I only give a 3 star rating",1
"Difficult to get in touch with customer services through the app, takes too long to get a response.",1
"I recently needed to download a file,it took ages,the connection constantly dropped out and then reconnecting. I had 5 bars of signal strength and a 4g connection.",1
4G works in some areas and not others - which can be frustrating.,1
"Ordered an iPhone 13 24 month contract specifically because of the 3 month Apple Tv subscription they offer, yet nothing has been mentioned to me about this after my order was delivered. Live chat team member was unhelpful and didn't know anything about it. Very poor service from ID Mobile. Where is is my offer?",1
"So far, I am pleased with the internet connection.I am having a lot of problems with the messages that I try to send. Sometimes it says 'message failure' or 'not delivered'",1
"Good network for a low cost - if you need any customer service though go elsewhere!  No one will get back to you (it’s all auto response, no humans), there is no phone number and the ‘live-chat’ wanted to put me in a queue for an hour. Unfortunately will likely have to move elsewhere as there is no way to talk to anyone without going into store! Bit disappointed.",1
"ID mobile offer a great price and to be honest I haven’t used it yet.A cautious warning to those watching/ trying to build their credit score - they carry out a hard search and this dropped my score by nearly 100 points on clear score - not sure I would have bothered if I had known a 12 month pay monthly, £12, sim had this impact!!",1
iD mobile good....3 network has been appalling in my area over recent weeks!!,1
"The Motorola Edge 40 has some glitches, it won't default to wifi calling sometimes.Outlook freezes on the calendar (never happened with my Samsung)Forgets email passwords and I need to reload the account to get it functioning.",1
"The company is great, but the transfer /upgrade process was difficult",1
If there is a problem the only point of contact is ask the community and I prefer  to have direct contact either by chat or phone with company,1
"Not happy with the mid term CPI price increases, Phone signal not too good",1
"I get a lot for my money; however, the service isn't always guaranteed. Reception can be very sketchy and signal strength not great.",1
"Although I am relatively happy with ID mobile, I have been using it for a while now but have had no offers to upgrade or get a better deal than my 2gb",1
"No good with Internet,passwords etc .As long as I don't have a query  or important questionall will be fine.Can still write a letter.",1
"Please note the service is good, however the billing and PDF bills have switched to a foreign language in the app and cannot be changed. The app is a bit slow slow and clunky. However the network, service and support are good well worth it.",1
"Not long with iD and no issues in UK, so great value for money. Spent a couple of days in the Netherlands where almost all connections (using an iPhone SE) were very slow, hardly useable, and a small number lightening fast. Didn't seem matter which supplier. somewhat disappointing.",1
"Good package prices, easy to set up. Not helpful that customer service not available to contact.Signal is very poor too non existent in my area so often unable to use the phone which is a big issue and will be a real consideration come renewal.",1
easy to move to this mobile network - deal was in February and despite numerous emails and responses still no sign up deal voucher,1
Coverage not as good as I had hoped,1
"New to ID mobile after 4 business day of waiting for the sim card to arrive was offered £10.00 compensation which i accepted and then the chat person kept pushing saying the royal mail don't delivery on Saturdays and that l could travel to get a sim card from my local Currys which is 7 miles away. She would not confirm if l was indeed l was being charged for something l don't have yet, and then withdrew the offer of ten pounds as l requested to speak to her Manager and has now passed to the complaints team so l have to wait for a call back in the next three days. Totally dismissing my requests clearly totally disengaged from what she was supposed to be doing not reading my messages correctly  below is a snippet of our conversation :_ID Mobile 1st you say you accept the offer then you say you want the complaints team to contact you on ********* to speak to a real person.Me: I'm sorry who do you think you are talking tooMe: Maybe you should go back and read the conversation as you are clearly not ?Me: I accepted your offer and then you kept pushing and now we are here ?ID Mobile : To you since I'm not real enough for you I will be passing your complaint to our complaints team.Great customer service",1
"My only complaint is that the Internet connection is poor. Very bad, to be frank.",1
I still have problems pretty much everywhere to download data. It often takes a long time or just won’t do it. I will try for a bit longer for now…,1
Dislike being notified of over spend would like warning first,1
"Your ordering process is very poor - it does not explain that you can only order one sim card at a time.  You get an order confirmation and then a day or so later, get an email advising that you have been declined due to credit referencing.There is no contact number which allows you to speak to a human - it is all done through webchat which is very slowThe package is great, delivery (when the order actually goes through) is great, the set up/number porting is fine.I would also like to be able to have one account with several numbers and control them all through one account.",1
Internet coverage not great when outdoorsDon't like not being able to talk to customer service agent when I have a problem,1
The mobile data can be very slow at times.   The call quality is not as good as my old provider. Easy to understand app   Have used their customer service and it was good even though only online.  They do have calling customer service if you have special needs.,1
"Unfortunately my calls use to drop with 3 mobile, so they do the same with ID also as they piggyback off them",1
Often lose signal especially data but sometimes calls too. Tried restarting but no change. Was very frustrating .,1
I like the price of the tariff but I'm not that impressed with coverage quality and data speeds.,1
"The prices are great, especially compared with EE. However, iD Mobile uses Three's network and this seems very patchy and in certain places is unusable where other networks are ok.The most annoying feature though is the fact that you can only manage one SIM in the app. This makes no sense at all and just causes me problems. To check my spend etc on my family's 3 SIMs I have to log in to 3 separate accounts! This is a pointless irritation that could easily be fixed.Another plus is that even on my old-ish phone, Wifi Calling works! That's an excellent feature.",1
"Great price, patchy coverage (maybe it's where I live).. when out and about I'm often without a signal for an hour or so.I'm told ID piggybacks on Three.. wonder if their users report the same?",1
"Very poor signal coverage it seems most places I go especially anything outside of a major town. Whilst ID signal is 1 bar Vodafone on my work phone is 3 bars . It’s really frustrating even with 2 bars nothing loads up or takes forever whilst my work stuff is fine. Poor but cheap, take your pick.",1
everything is good apart from the coverage which is a bit pants in the south west,1
I struggle to get connections in a lot of places .. when my contract ends I will go back to EE unless it gets better,1
"iD offer very affordable pay monthly contracts, £26 for an iPhone 13 with unlimited data. The service is ok, I travel around the UK and the signal isn’t great in Leeds centre (data doesn’t work at all) or York along with other cities. Vodafone which was my last phone network was £15 more but suppose you get a much better signal and service if you pay that little bit more. The signal or data isn’t great with iD but if you need an affordable option then iD will do the job but it can also be frustrating when 30% of the time your calls might drop or you can’t use the internet.",1
"The deal given by ID mobile (June 2023) - Iphone 14 pro and good data was the best i found in the market. However, the connectivity and its network across the UK (where there is no 5G) was average to poor. Its a new network so i guess it may improve in the next few years but for now its slow in many parts of the country.",1
