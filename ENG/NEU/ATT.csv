"Quite expensive, I was in the USA for some weeks and used it, would not fully recommend.",1
Didn't have many choices on prepaid phones if they had more prepaid phones then a bigger selection it would be all right,1
"Our internet is not always reliable. It goes out frequently weekly, but when it works it's fairly quick. Unfortunately the problem hasn't been resolved yet.",1
Poor customer service.Their fiber service isn't very reliable. Has issues that they won't admit to. And won't fix either.Plenty of issues either they want to roll a truck out to you but charge you if they find nothing or they want to replace your equipment when it's already been replaced twice.I won't give  them anything less because overall it's been tolerable at least in my situation. Unlike other companies I've dealt with that weee much worse. They at least have a small level of stability.But poor customer service and tech support is the reason I take the stars,1
"This should’ve been a one star, but Jerome ID # JW913Q Completely saved the day. For about 30 hours, I couldn’t use my work cell phone Because three different individuals in the customer service couldn’t figure out how to get my phone connected to the E-SIM. It took only 40 minutes and that is including me calling in and verifying my information so most likely around 20 minutes it took Jerome to fix the issue. If it had not been for him, I was getting ready to cancel everything.",1
Just reporting after paying off an ATT phone and not being on subscription plan the online phone unlock does NOT work.This forces you contact customer support force them to unlock your phone. Yes they trying to keep you on. There are services that are cheaper than ATT plans.,1
"I lost Internet service after 8 pm Friday 6/7/24. Called to report it and was told AT&T had a outage in my area and it would be repaired by 7 am the next day. By 7 am Saturday 6/8/24 my Internet was still down. Was told it would be Monday evening 6/10/24 before they could get someone out. I noticed on Saturday morning that the fiberoptic cable ,from the utility pole, was on the ground of my neighbor's property. 3 days without Internet is rediculous.",1
"I spent well over an hour and a half speaking with OSHAINE from ATT this morning.  The reason it was so frustrating had nothing to do with OSHAINE as he maintained his calm and friendly Demeanor the whole time and he did, eventually, through his knowledge of non published methods, get my Tv and remote working properly again.  I thank him sincerely for his professional service.Billy",1
"I was with another phone service for 3 years. I live in a very rural area and to make matters worse, it's in valley so service was sketchy and to add insult to injury, the rates kept going up.  About a year ago, I switched to AT&T and my service has improved 100%.  Customer service is always helpful and except for being gouge when I missed a payment, I have no complaints.  I'm on a fixed income so low cost is important but staying in contact with family and friends and being able to cal out in case of emergency is of utmost importance.  I'm sure glad I switched from Verizon to AT&T.",1
"The reception can be patchy in the ATL area, but honestly the prices compared to other providers are pretty good. I don't think I'll switch anytime soon unless something better comes up.",1
"Great products, not so great service. We have frequent outages in my area caused by a small animal chewing on a wire. I doubt that's the reason for the frequent outages, but if it is, why can't they make something that can't be easily damaged by rodents?",1
"The connection they offer is not very stable and don't bother calling customer service, they will just say the problem is on your end.And when it comes to speed, it is too expensive for what you get, I do not recommend their service.",1
"I tried att air for seven day trial.  It worked fine initially-faster speed, easy set up and cheaper than my current plan. However, a major issue was noted that caused me to return the unit. Air runs off of cell towers that only provide “dynamic”ip addresses (meaning that the ip address changes every day). This caused my apps(Hulu live and Utube live) to change location every day.  Got locked out of Hulu because of the 4 locations change cap. Requires “static” ip address.  Tech support said this cannot be changed.  So… back it went to att.A month later I received a-bill for $121.71 ( two months) .  I called to make sure we are not charged to card.  Charges waived. Told toDisregard emails about return,billing etc.Three months later I got an automated email notification that my account will go to collection for amount of $67.81.  Had to call to get this fixed since automated email would destroy my credit rating.  They (billing) saidagain to ignore any automated emails as account will be closed ( it should have been closed the first time).",1
"We have been an AT&T Mobile Phone customer for many years. Service has been OK.We upgraded our phones due to AT&T advertising - ""Upgrade your phone for Free if it is paid off"".  The Sugar Land, TX  Store did this but did not tell us about all the Fees involved: Upgrade Fee, Installment amount that they said we would get back later., etc. They said our new Bill should only go up about $1.00/month. This first Bill went up $98, instead of going down.Now we are ""stuck"" with a 3 year Installment ""loan"" for a ""Free"" Phone, even though there are offset credits. We asked when we would get the offset credits back, the store said we would get these first couple of months fees back at the end of the 3 year contract.We feel Deceived by AT&T. Misrepresentation and dishonesty.",1
"Decided to switch from my old carrier in January 2023.  Ordered the lavender Galaxy 23 Plus in early February 2023.  Still didn't have it by my birthday (02/26), and was told by the local store that somehow the order got cancelled.  Local store reordered it in and finally I visit the store to get it on March 14th, 2023.  I ordered lavender but all that the store had was black, as lavender is allegedly still on backorder... Had also picked out a lavender case before I even put in the original order, but at the store, no lavender cases.  Sat there for over an hour awaiting the data transfer, then $184 later, I'm out the door with the phone... only to discover at home that all of my calls and most of my text messages are still going only to the phone from my former carrier.  Didn't get anything that I wanted out of this deal other than a new phone, but I could have walked out the door with it from my old carrier for about $20 cheaper.  This is a horrible way to start a new relationship with a customer and I am seriously considering a return since I'm still in the 14-day window.  The employee who helped me along the way has been nothing but courteous and professional, but I feel like ALL of this should have been taken care of by now.  So annoyed!",1
I and others I know purchased a galaxy 22 ultra.  It has been the most frustrating phone I have ever owned.  It gives me more problems and has more issues.  I wish I still had my note 9.  It was great.  I believe something is wrong with the S22 Ultra.  I am far from happy with this phone!!,1
"First my email address was hacked then I changed the primary email, then I noticed they changed it back to the old primary email. Which I asked them to remove the old email from my account which they never did.My wi-fi on my pc is 2.4 when it is supposed to be 5ghz.I received a duplicate phone number however, the business that I received the duplicate number changed their number after I contacted them.They do not like to respond by email to complaints they prefer to call and then it's your word against theirs.I am not interested in going to another company, they should just fix the issues and try to keep their especially long-time customers. Now, I do not want Fiber, I am satisfied with the service I have now.Well, I received a notice that they are charging $5.00 more for internet, and I do not have Fiber. No excuse for the increase.The service was hacked, and they sent out a letter informing the customers, now they want to increase the internet service. Not good customer service from At&t.My former router modem which I received was not refurbished it still had old customers information such as parent child safety which kept me from making changes to router modem, so I just sent it back and received a replacement.What are they doing to retain their customer's?No Senior citizen discounts. lolJust expect better from them especially since my bills are up to date not that it makes a difference.Well, I will be checking out other internet services as of now!",1
"It is a good thing that AT&T provides me with good cellular service because I had a horrible experience with a representative when I was in an AT&T store to buy a new phone.  I was snapped at and spoken rudely to by the service representative. I don’t know if there is no training being given to these service representatives, or whether this woman was having a horrendous day, but there is no reason why a service representative should snap at a customer.",1
"I have a pre-pay plan that works for me. The only way to get any customer service is to go to my store. If you call you will be on the phone for a very long time. My first experience at the ATT store was awful. I purchased a new smart phone, my first one, and the man that waited on me told me that he could not transfer my phone numbers. He also didn't show me anything about the phone. I called the next day and talked to someone else and she told me to come back to the store and she would help me. I went in and she was very nice and helpful. I also talked to the manager of the store and made a complaint about my first experience. If I need anything I always call ahead and make sure that the woman who helped me is there. It seems that there is not a lot of good customer service at a lot of stores these days.",1
I've been a customer for over 25 years at the same address.  All of a sudden my phone doesn't work and my bill is paid.  They sent a Service Tech who could not fix things.  I'm so mad I could spit.,1
AT&T is getting shut down for good and being banned from the United States!!,1
"I had AT&T internet service at a rural location, and it has been consistently terrible from the start. I grew tired of constantly having to call them to complain about it (as they couldn't do anything to make it better anyway). Daily, we had to reset the router to get it working again, and the speed varied between 1 and 15 Mbps (averaging around 8 when it felt like working). After enduring a couple of years of this ""service,"" I was relieved to find that T-Mobile offered a more affordable solution.When I called AT&T to discontinue the service, the salesperson suggested ""suspending"" the account instead of closing it. This sounded good at the time since I was unsure whether T-Mobile would be worse than them. Unfortunately, the salesperson failed to mention that the service would automatically resume after 3 months.T-Mobile ended up being three times faster (without the resets!) for less than half the cost of AT&T. Needless to say, there was no reason to reactivate AT&T service. However, they still had my credit card on file, and it turns out they had been charging me for over 5 months—over $100/mo—before I caught it on my credit card statement. And please note that when I went online to check the account it was shown as disabled!When I called them to address the issue, they acknowledged the mistake and mentioned that it would take multiple weeks to rectify, promising a callback. I explicitly told them to close the account. Unfortunately, they never called me back. After seeing yet another bill, I called them again. This time they couldn't charge it since I had them remove my credit card from the file. During the call, they agreed that the account should have been closed, and the charge was invalid.I'm still waiting for them to call me with my $500+ refund, but instead, I received a notice from the collection agency for the money they couldn't charge me after the second attempted account closure. If this is not an example of extreme incompetence, I don't know what is. AT&T, get your act straight and give me my money back! Please!Update 1/3/24: Upgrading from 1 star to 3 stars. After multiple further unsuccessful engagements with AT&T customer support, I ended up initiating a dispute which prompted ATT Office of the President (top tier customer support) contacting me. Donato A. was able to help me and issue the refund as well as cancel the invalid debt collection. Thank you Donato!",1
Just switched my business to AT&T phone and internet due to the promise of fiber internet. Was previously with Comcast and didn't really have a big problem with them. Switched about 1 month ago and since then I've noticed about a quarter of the voicemails we receive are chopped up and cannot be comprehended. Fortunately I can get envelope information with the phone number the message was received from and call them back but the information in the message has to be relayed again which is frustrating for the customer as well as us.Finally made contact with AT&T and was surprised to hear that this has been a known issue that is apparently a problem with Verizon wireless customers leaving voicemails. The representative told me there is nothing AT&T can do about it as it's a problem on Verizon's side of things. The problem happens with Verizon customers that are within the state that try to leave voicemails. Out of state Verizon customers don't have that problem apparently.My cell phone service is through Verizon and I have left messages at my shop that are clear and have no problem.It's not the end of the world as I can just get envelope information about the not decipherable call and call them back. But people that take time to leave a voicemail usually leave information that I'd like to have prior to calling them back so it makes the process a little more inconvenient.AT&T offered no type of time line on resolution and told me it was a problem Verizon has to deal with not them. I never had this issue before with Comcast and only first had this problem come up the day we switched from Comcast to AT&T.Just a little disappointed in the AT&T service and the response to this problem.,1
I don't like there customer care. Very slow to get response.You Guys really need to work on this.,1
Good company but they could do better with their products and pricings.,1
"Customer service is the worst ever. Talked to three different people over the course of an hour to add someone to my phone line and learned nothing after that time. Had to give ALL my information three times, one time for each customer service rep.Phone service is good",1
"The automated system would NOT give me an option to pay on my own. Maybe this is on purpose because as nice as the lady was, you at corporate FORCE THEM TO BUG THE CRAP OUT OF US. FOUR TIMES, I said, no, thank you to her sales spiels. Stop bothering us and let us just pay the bill. If we wanted to hear specials, we can ask. The call at that point was so long, I died, dried up into a mummy, was reincarnated and then died again.",1
"the stupid cell phone wouldnt play the mp3 i got off gcnlive for alex jones or some file as i remember,yet i did like how if you ran out of data the internet still worked at a lower speed",1
"I have been with AT&T wireless for about 30 years altogether. They use to be OUTSTANDING. Without question, the best service and customer service across the country.Then they bought Direct TV ... who was sinking because of their HORRIBLE customer service. AT&T put in Direct TV people and they were destroyed.I have no customer loyalty to them any more because they don't value me.",1
"We live in a rural area, so our only choice was DSL. The bill is much cheaper than satellite at just $56 per month. It runs one or two TVs at a time, but we do have to deal with buffering if we try to use our living room and bedroom tv simultaneously. Also had a difficult time getting everything set up, customer support would constantly tell us something different everyday. I also wish this internet would run my tv and my daughter's tablet at the same time.",1
"The internet and TV works when they do but when they encounter issues, that's when the nightmare starts. Customer service sucks. Long wait queue just to be transferred to I don't know where. Would always to suck money out of your pocket. Beware of their scheme. For every call, they will sell things you don't need and for sure won't use.",1
"I was so happy when I saw that At & T added the extra HBO and movie channels free during the wknd and Monday and then they took them away especially in these hard times they should show some loyalty and humanity for so many people at home when so many other companies and people are helping with money and compassionate actions..Sad..thinking of changing after contract is over..Lake Forest, CA 92630:( :( :(",1
Hardly any Service in my town. At home I have to use Wifi to call and text. I work from my phone so i need a good connection and it doesnt get a good signal at all hardly a bar.and Ill be in the middle of town .Tell us in that area you dont have good service and stop wasting our money.They do have the Best prepaid ratesNew service here i come I cant deal with it anymore.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer since I bought my first cell phone years ago.  Last week I purchased a replacement phone as my current cell phone had ""had it"".  Was advised that it would arrive between the 24th and 26th of Dec.  Christmas eve was told that now it it would be delayed by ONE MONTH.  I cancelled my order and went online at Best Buy, and FOUR HOURS later walked away with a better phone. Maybe AT&T should just direct us to Best Buy!",1
"AT&T is the service I use and have had for the last three months.  I got the new iPhone 13 and I’ve had 5g auto on the whole time( I’m the settings for cellular), we don’t get 5g with AT&T in grants pass so my phone has been going back and forth trying to search for a network. Thus, giving me slow speeds and using all my battery. I switched my phone to LTE only and I’ve not had any problems with connectivity, overheating, or my battery just plain dying. I wish this was something they explained to me while I was there because my battery health, nearly in a brand new iPhone is at 94%. There was nothing that anyone knew that could be causing This issue beside a “defect to the phone” I’m gonna say it’s the “5g” networks we do not receive that messes with our data.",1
I have been an AT&T customer for 5 years. They advertise the best 5G..... I have one of the newest phones out...still 4G. It honey depends on your location. I walk into work and have 1 bar. They guy next to me has Verizon with 4 bars. Direct TV is a Rip off...... Customer service is horrible. My Note9 works great at home but unfortunately I'm at work more than home. They all have their ups and downs. I've had both and honestly will be going back to Verizon soon......,1
"They're a mobile company what do you expect. The service works, they provide good service (have used as a customer and as a business-business is better service!). What more do you want? They are a corporation making money from a oligopoly and should be regulated as a utility for the public good but that's not for me to decide.",1
"Does anyone really love their cable or phone provider? In my many experiences, AT&T is not the worst, but it is also not the best. Their mobile service is decent, U-Verse TV is average and incredibly high-priced, but their internet has been some of the best I have had in Florida. So, 3 stars it is!",1
"I, personally, have never had any problem with AT&T, but I will be switching to a different carrier only because of their support and promotion of OAN and their contributions to other issues I do not morally condone or agree with.",1
"Decided to cancel my ATT cellular plan two months back. Was promised a free Iphone11 on my second visit with loyalty service only to receive my bill and be over charged $10. Manager said there’s no record from phone call with loyalty rep that she offered the phone for free or that she promised a specific billing price that would incur until I changed plan. Att has no loyalty to customers, only to con their customers to be falsely offered something over the phone so there is no evidence of transaction to keep us happy until billing arrives. Unbelievable that there is nothing in loyalty report to support my recall of discussion.",1
"Better options available, Verizon much better on all fronts.",1
"Not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, not as good as they claim. Thanks, Kevin from customer support for trying to help me. Worked to a certain degree.",1
"I opened an AT&T account in August of 2018. I had to pay for one Galaxy S9, and I received  one free. A couple of days ago one of the phones just shut for no apparent reason. My fiance had to buy a replacement $89.00 phone for that evening. AT&T tell us that the phone warranty is up and we would have to pay $112.00 deductible in order to recieve the same device. She nor I  did anything to cause the device to stop working. I never had a device from any carrier who's device just shut down. We have insurance for damages, or theft only. How can you give out devices that can't last until the upgrade period is applicable. Each customer should know they may have to spend additional funds if AT&T devices decide to stop working at the time of purchase.",1
"Maybe I expected too much...not! Got great service initially from the folks at the Kiosk at Windward Mall. Was excited that they were going to have a permanent store there. In the meantime I went to the store at Windward City and when they felt like speaking with me (TV was on and they were busy watching) I got misinformation. That's okay, people make mistakes. Went back, got help. Went to the new  store in Windward Mall. The young man was sarcastic when I explained my question, (Do you folks have customer service training?) then gave me the wrong information (low storage doesn't always mean you need a bigger card in your phone), I already had a larger card in my phone but he didn't look so how would he know. I cannot wait to end my contract, T-mobile was a little more money so I moved but am happy to go back and pay more for great customer service!",1
"They are the only service provider in my area with any signal.  It's pretty expensive & their website needs to be calmed down, but at least they work.",1
AT&T appears to listen to their reviews. We will follow with their business promises. It seems none of us want guns in the hands of babes. Good choice.,1
For the money we pay for for cable and phone is to much all ATT DO IS SHOW THE SAME BORING OLD ASS MOVIES UPGRADE  WITH THE MOVIES,1
get your rural customers the service they need you cheepscates you don't have to be in the money day one offer package to all,1
Tried using them for a month. Customer service are not very helpful but phone call clarity was good,1
"Why 3 stars?  Love my reception and phone but customer service is lacking and confused at best.   In the last 5 weeks I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with them.  I went back and added up the time.... (it's actually close to 11 and I am currently on the phone with them now)  This isn't a COVID thing, it was like this pre-COVID.  If you ask the same question to 5 people in CS, you get 5 different answers.  None are close to the others.  Someone needs to make a manual and share it with the employees and give them answers to questions people ask.I traded in 2 phones about 4 months... still no credit.  Auto Pay is a joke.  I paused it (I never opted in to use it), but it took out money anyway.  I cancel auto pay and have to pay $20 additional each month because I don't use AUTOPAY. I've been a customer 10 years, obviously I pay my bill.The only time I drop calls is when I call them and they transfer me..... it happens often then, but that's the only time.The other options aren't any better, but I do wish they would improve the customer service over the phone.",1
I see tons of bad reviews but I like my AT&T service... I think it is reasonable for cost and the service is great.,1
"Have cingular then it became AT&T. Ive been with them since they merged. What gets my goat is, they have unlimited data, but have data caps. When its busy they slow down your data speed. I have an older plan with 6 shared gigs. All the new plans have unlimited and most other companies offer unlimited. I was looking at the samsung Z flip for my wife. ATT told me they would give me the phone free if I trade my note 9 in and agree to a 36 month contract I wanted to keep my $1000 phone. So I can sign a 3 year contract and pay off the phone every month. I wanted to do a contract and pay for the phone with an upgrade discount. But nope they won`t do that. I also pointed out that Tmobile is giving away the 128gig samsung z flip for free to new customers and add a second line and they will give you an $800 off a second smart phone of your choice. So what`s my motivation to stay with ATT when I still only have a 6 shared gig plan and they are offering nothing for upgrading your plan. My contract has been fulfilled many months ago and the company is getting cheap with promo`s so maybe consider moving to Tmobile or Verizon. Both are offering better deals and stealing ATT customers. They must have so many they don`t really care.",1
Good speeds in the Texas area. Currently on U-verse for my home office. They can improve a bit on support though.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer my entire life. My family was back when they were Cingular Wireless, and then I got on my own plan when I was an adult. I am in my 30's. My primary reason for staying with AT&T so long was the good coverage and reasonable pricing, because any time I needed to make any changes to my account such as get a new phone, it was a nightmare and took hours to get everything all swapped over. Well, that good pricing recently changed. AT&T does not include their line access charges in their plan quotes like Verizon does, so you actually wind up paying significantly more than the advertised price. I think the thing that bothered me most, is when I contacted AT&T via chat to see what could be done now that we needed a new phone (which required their unlimited plans), the rep kept giving me different quotes, lied (hopefully accidentally) to me and told me the total she gave included the line access, then turned around and said it didn't. I don't feel like AT&T is clear on the charges that will be on your bill and that's extremely frustrating when trying to pick a plan. And honestly that whole experience plus the last few experiences I've had trying to get new phones has prompted this review. Verizon was transparent about everything on their site. Verizon was able to offer us free Hulu and Disney+ with our current plan, so that reduces a monthly expense for us, plus offer unlimited.",1
"My recent contact with AT&T wasn't about their service, it was about upgrading to a new phone. I have had AT&T for a very long time and although have had issues with dropped calls, so has other providers. My online experience today was good, but the person I was chatting with had limited access and knowledge to what I was looking for in a phone and seemed to be unaware that what I was looking for does exist. I am looking to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 7 active and the 2 features an upgrade must have is Gorilla Glass screen, not a protector you add or an otter box, but an actual Gorilla Glass screen. Was told that it had to be purchased separately. Not true...my current phone the Samsung Galaxy S7 active came factory with Gorilla Glass and totally water proof. My next must be is water proof. Couldn't get a clear answer about the phone they were recommending about the specs of the phone which they say the Samsung S 20 Ultra is similar to what I have. That isn't what I'm looking for... it must have the Gorilla glass. Was suggested I could pay for the added protection in case my screen should get shattered... I understand the concept, but build a better phone and you have to protection built in like with the Galaxy S7 active. Having insurance doesn't help if my phone screen gets shattered in the middle of the night and I can not use my phone. Build a better phone.",1
Had an better overall experience with t-mobile.,1
They help me sometimes. Sometimes not very nice. Good prices though.,1
"I don't hate AT&T and I also don't love them.... I've had them for about 10 years ever since my ex-husband wanted an iPhone for Christmas and this was when they had the exclusive so we switched carriers and plans to get them.  I've been with them ever since.I travel a lot - and often out of the country - so I usually use one of their plans where I can use my phone so I have data, text and can make calls at a discounted rate.  It's expensive to purchase one of their pre-set plans for about $60 or $150.  The last time I did this I was saddled with a $220 phone call from a Kyoto (Japan) hotel to another where I thought I had left a favorite pair of pants (which I hadn't and were actually not even packed in my bag and were safe at home, bummer).I called - and they fed me some BS about how even if I had paid for the plan I couldn't use wifi and showed me where it was on like page 47 of their plan I signed up for.  It was super confusing and didn't make sense.  Instead of arguing I asked what we could do now after the fact since I had obviously tried to avoid that by paying in advance for the travel plan.  They backdated some plan for me and modified the call to about $30.  Still more than I thought I should pay but it was better than the $220.This happens a lot when I travel but the bottom line is, calling in and asking them or paying the $10 overseas fee to use it daily is probably best.  Or perhaps a SIM card.Otherwise I don't have major issues with AT&T.  They're pretty good as far as my regular plan goes and I've made minimal changes in the past 10 years.  It works for me.",1
Decent experience if you don't call their support team.,1
outrageous prices but... can't beat the service,1
"Just an averaged company, nothing special.",1
"When AT&T advertises a ""Buy One-Get One"" deal - buyer beware! NOTHING is free with AT&T!My BOGO deal was a ""free"" iPhone 7 when purchasing (signing a contract for) an iPhone 7+. After the purchase, I noticed a recurring credit of $21 on my bill. I thought it was because of certain discounts I get for membership in an organization AT&T honors, so I didn't pay much attention to the credit.Later, when I was able to pay off all my mobile devices, I noticed my bill had increased over $300! After arguing with the customer service rep, I was informed that AT&T had expected me to continue the installment payment plan for the iPhone 7+ for 30 months. But because I paid the balance for the installment plan after only 17 months, I was now liable for the remaining balance for the ""BOGO"" iPhone 7. I was INCREDULOUS!When I objected, the lady told me that I was informed this would happen at the time I paid off the balance. However I was never informed and told the customer service rep that if they wanted the $300 for the ""free"" phone they should take it out of the other rep's paycheck because he failed to inform me of the consequences of paying off the balance of the installment plan.Of course, she said they couldn't do that. So I demanded that AT&T should absorb the $300 because it's a misunderstanding and, after all, I've been a loyal customer for 25 years and it would be good customer relations. I said if AT&T would do this, I would make my satisfaction known publicly through Social Media. However, if AT&T failed to handle this in my favor, I said I would take that experience public on Social Media as well.The customer service rep paused for a moment, put me on hold, and voila! When she reconnected with me she said they had worked out a deal for me. If I ""technically"" put the iPhone 7 BACK on an ""installment plan,"" they could continue the monthly $21 credit until the balance of the installment plan was paid, with nothing coming out of my pocket! I agreed to this compromise, and AT&T has held up their end of the bargain. So, AT&T is now paying for their own ""free"" BOGO phone again.This issue was, indeed, resolved to my satisfaction, and ALL of the 3 service reps I spoke with were courteous, friendly, and competent.But remember, AT&T + BOGO = Buyer Beware!! Nothing is ""free"" with AT&T.",1
