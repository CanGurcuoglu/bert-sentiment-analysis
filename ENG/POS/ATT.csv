"I am a new AT&T customer. Your install team--Joe and Lee--were here at my home for about 4 hours on 1.10.25. They were both extremely pleasant, patient, helpful and conscientious. They took great care in choosing the best location for our new AT&T Internet equipment and were fastidious in keeping our home just as they found it. They were the most courteous of ""workmen"" we could have in and out of our house for several hours. We honestly enjoyed speaking with them and finding them both personable and thoughtful. We recommend them very highly and they gave us the absolute best first impression of our new relationship with AT&T!Also, I want to comment on Blaine, an ""account"" man who came while Joe and Lee were here. He was also a most pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable employee of whom you may be proud! He explained many things about our service and even gave suggestions I found very positive and enlightening.",2
"Greg went above and beyond to fix my problem, showd patience and friendly. Am so glad I have switched to AT&T.",2

"Matthew at the West End Ave. location in Nashville, TN went ""above and beyond"" to assist me during a recent visit to the store. After I relayed to him that I suffer from short term memory loss due to a recent illness, he patiently helped me to program my new cell phone and guided me through how to use it. Matthew exemplified what it means to be both tech savvy and customer friendly. I am grateful to ATT for making the transition to my new phone a positive and uncomplicated experience.",2
My iphone broke on Christmas Eve and I had to call AT&T customer support to transfer my number to my old phone Christmas morning. Simon was very helpful and patient! I am so happy to have had him assist me and I hope he gets the best Christmas bonus this year!,2
I had a scheduled appointment with AT&T to repair my land-line. It took a few days and they were unable to get to it on my scheduled day. But I really appreciated they came out the next morning which was Saturday and fixed it. Many thanks to the technician.,2
"We had an amazing experience with Kevin at AT&T! He was incredibly helpful in finding us a great deal, and the best part was his approach—he wasn't pushy or trying to oversell us. Instead, he made us feel like we were getting advice from a friend who genuinely wanted to help. Kevin's friendly and professional demeanor made the entire process smooth and stress-free. Highly recommend him for anyone looking to have a positive and enjoyable experience at AT&T!",2

I just wanted to write a review about going to AT&T in Charlotte North Carolina on South Tryon. I receive such good service. I’m close to 70 and they spend time to explain everything to me. There was a manager named Stetson that I was very pleased with how he explained everything so I would give him a five a great review.,2
"Avery is an outstanding representative for AT&T at Best Buy in Altamonte Springs. Normally, I do not stop for sales pitches, but Avery's approach caught my attention. He actively listened to my concerns, never made me feel pressured, and allowed me to take my time with the decision. He was also incredibly courteous to other customers, assuring them he would assist them as well.This was my first experience with AT&T, and I hope the service lives up to the high standard Avery set. I took advantage of the iPhone 15 family plan deal and couldn't be happier. When I had a follow-up question after Thanksgiving, Avery responded the same day with the same level of professionalism and care.Avery doesn’t just talk the talk—he truly walks the walk. Exceptional customer service like his deserves recognition. AT&T, give this man a raise!",2

"I am glad I am a customer at AT&T. Every time there is a hurricane for example they always jump into action making sure that I am okay, offering help, making sure I can always stay in communication with loved ones etc. It’s really thoughtful and shows how much they value their customers. Thank you AT&T :) for always going above and beyond.",2
Whenever you call AT&T to hold your cellular service . They will hurry up and disconnect you . Never handle what you need for them to take care of . If you are paying your Bill or buying a new product they are quick to dismissed you .I went on a cruise and AT&T has that international fee for $12 . I cut off my WiFi my Bluetooth my cellular service . Yet they still charge d me . Everyday I took a picture to show them that it was cut off . These bastards going to say I used my phone . Then show me to where I made one phone or sent one text . The next thing they ended our conversation. I’m at the point to where I think I’m going to have to get rid of them,2
"I don’t remember the exact date but about 2 weeks ago we went into the local Columbus, Georgia AT&T store on Macon Road needing account assistance.   After listening to our situation Theresa Wall went above and beyond what we were expecting for customer service!  She immediately greeted us, listened to our situation, not only did what we needed but offered other suggestions all while being patient and kind. Great job Theresa!  Thank you.",2
"We have just visited AT&T store located at @9725 Skokie Blvd, Skokie and were served by Gerardo. He was courteous, knowledgeable about almost everything we asked him and explained all our queries in lay person’s language courteously and with humor. His demeanor was brilliant compelling us to write immediately after getting out of the store. Truly appreciated his advice and help. Wish all your staff would be same calibre.",2
"I would like to thank Barry from AT&T for his excellent service to repair a cut fiber cable at my home in Maumelle, Arkansas. The original fiber contractors that came out were going to reroute the new cable across my front lawn and under my driveway. This would have done a lot of damage to my yard and possibly messed up my irrigation lines. I contacted AT&T service, and they sent out an inspector who did everything he could to route the new fiber cable through its original path so there was no need dig up my yard. Barry was terrific. Barry certainly deserves all the credit and made my day by resolving this issue. I am now a big fan of AT&T and highly recommend them.",2
"Never take AT&T . This is a bullshit company. Great scam I have ever seen. I did trade-in and later on paid of the device to unlock the device. Technically I paid 2 times , later on they take out my trading credit form bill coz i paid of the device. And they do scam when i purchase the line they did not explain me that it has 36 month contract, They said you can move anytime. That was another trap for me. It's been 1 year's i am still overpaying everybills. If i leave i have to pay a lot for each phone. Never chose this company. Your life will be in hell like me.😞. Also agent said their system has some billing problem, If your system has problem why we will pay more money for that?? My request everyone please never take AT&T.",2

I was just wanting to know is there anything I can do to lower my bill and he was extremely helpful explain to me about a $50 insurance that I didn’t even know that I was paying every month, among a few other things in total he lowered my bill by over $73 per month thank you so much, Joel",2
"I had  recently added  AT&T phone service  to my long standing internet  service. I got  my  Galaxys24 FE in th email, its a much better  and more advanced phone than Im use to. I was disheartened when I called several stores in my area (Tulsa) to be told they couldnt help me with file transfers or anything tech support related. I finally made the call to customer service, and the tech that got on the phone was corteous and  knowledgable, he took the time to understand my issue, and had the patience to calmy walk me through every detail and help me understand each process so I would be a more informed  customer of my devices. He even went above and beyond to help me fix  the home wi-fi crisis that plagued me for over 2 years. Id like to personally thank AT&T  for  keeping such fine customer service  reps  and techs employed. Though it took time, mostly due to me, I did take the extra time to speak to his supervisor and ensure they knew I was impressed and thankful for all that my tech did. I believe in giving praise  for excellence in customer care. Thank you",2
"I had a great experience on my most recent visits to AT&T in Tallahassee, Florida.  Blake W. was very helpful in setting up my prepaid plan and resolved a recent issue with my daughter's phone plan.  We spoke to several agents and even a manager at a different store to resolve the issue with my daughter's phone, but felt like we were going in circles.  I'm thankful he was able to resolve the problem.",2

Before I dealt with Steve, I had a couple of bad experiences with that store and was very hesitant to even go back. Since dealing with Steve, he always goes above and beyond with service and his knowledge is great! I ask for him every time and even waited for him for over an hour + last time. Highly recommend!",2
I’ve had AT&T for 5 years now and my bundle discounts were never applied for having their internet and phone services. They were not willing to give me a discount by a manager. I was told it’s ONLY FOR NEW CUSTOMER!!!!! So they don’t care if they lose a loyal customer. Thank you to Trinity for her great customer service and for understanding. She was able to apply some discount for being a loyal customer. She didn’t want to lose a loyal customer. Thank you again Trinity.,2
"Went to AT&T in Merrillville on US30 with a cell phone issue and the service I received was more than fabulous and the employees Ms. Raven, Ms. Shonna and Mr. Terrell went beyond the call of duty to make sure I was completely satisfied and all my electronics was in working condition.

The store manager, Aaron and the assistant manager, Arlene, spent a lot of time resolving an issue I was having.  They were knowledgeable, personable, and patient with my many questions.  It was all taken care of without making me feel rushed.  It's the kind of customer service I always wish for, but don't always receive, and it is much appreciated.",2

We just had the first positive experience going into an AT&T store. Garrett Johnson was the most knowledgeable competent serviceman. He needs to be training other employees. He was super personable and gave us excellent advice. We went with his advice and he was able to complete our transaction in minutes instead of hours! I highly recommend that AT&T promote him and put him in charge of customer relations. G-man made us love AT&T again!,2
We were having many issues after signing up with AT&T through Costco.

"Wonderful company - I have had AT&T Prepaid for a couple weeks, going on month and the company has been great! The service is reliable, and the customer care team has been nothing short of amazing. I remember when I was activating my phone and I was short by a couple dollars, the rep who was awesome did a credit, helped me and had my service up and running with no issues. The plans are great, the website works like a charm. However, I do wish a mobile app was offered for the prepaid side, but that's okay. I will give this company a solid 10/10. I have never encountered issues with signal, customer care, or being dramatically congested and slowed down. Truly unlimited for $65.00 is a deal. That's for sure! I highly recommend AT&T Prepaid.",2
"On 15FEB23 at 4PM , my wife and I visited the AT&T store on Whittesey Blvd. in Columbus, Ga. to explore options for unlimited cellular data from AT&T.

DJ immediately understood the purpose of our visit and quickly went over the various options for cellular data to include monthly costs and the application of my veterans discount. DJ was very professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. He exhibited genuine concern that our cellular needs were met and that we were fully satisfied with the plan we received. AT&T is fortunate to have DJ as a front line customer service representative.Thank you,John Baggett",2

It is very, very, very hard to find quality employees. Treat the ones you have right. I want to thank her again for her excellent service.",2
I have liked AT&Ts service. The real reason for the review though is to thank Jen in customer support. She solved a problem for me efficiently and it was an issue no other AT&T service rep was able to figure out. She located my trade in phone which was somehow not processed initially. She put my mind at ease.  She was great!,2
"We use AT&T for internet and wireless services. So far we have been happy with the fees and service overall. At times the internet can be slower, but they have so many various levels you can choose which internet level you need. I need the highest since I stream, trade options and do a lot of internet shopping.My cellphone service is good too. Overall no dropped calls or lag time when I am out of the house. I can surf and watch videos when we are on vacay!WOULD RECOMMEND",2
"I was trying to get on-line to make calls but since late yesterday, was unable to make any calls.  I could received them from the message site--Anyway, we went to AT&T in Gulfport, Crossroads Pkwy and was assisted by Mr. Keith Edwards, the Store Manager.  He listened to my problem, asked to see the phone and in less than a minute had everything back the way it was supposed to be.I asked him to show me his magic and it was a case of  simple ""turn off/turn on"".  He was friendly, helpful, kind----If all trips to ATT were done that way, ATT would be swamped dailyandMr. Edwards would own the company---with knowledge and kindness.",2
"A company is only as good as its employees.After being tossed around by one of its competitors, I decided to switch to AT&T and purchased two Samsung 2023 Ultras. One was stolen from my shopping cart. After several visits to an AT&T store, the personnel were very helpful but unable or unwilling to get me across the finish line. As a last resort, I decided to try another store and was taken immediately by Evan Montoya, a rare find for any company. He was extremely patient, self-confident, and super knowledgeable. And most of all, he was able to resolve my problem. He is Management material.After the replacement S2023 Ultra arrived, we returned to the store only to be told that Evan had been transferred to a new location. Although we will seek Evans's assistance with the new phone, I am confident that the young woman who told us Evan was transferred would do a competent job transferring the information and apps to the new phone. Unfortunately, I did not get her name.I would give a 5 STAR rating to two of the three AT&Tstores I visited.",2
Only good things to say about them!I have great phone service and they provide great customer service. I've been a loyal customer for years/decades and have no intention to switch.,2

I am literally on the phone as I write this review with AT&T. We are all so quick to write a bad review. I want to be just as quick to write a good review as I would a bad one. Customer Service with AT&T TODAY was the best I've recieved ever. As far as customer service goes. I had more than one issue and Alexis for business customer services with AT&T was remarkable! She took care of every issue I had mentioned within a 10-15 min time frame. Not only was it fast service but also super relieving concidering I work as well. So every minute can be way to time consuming but Alexis made every minute worthwhile. I am able to get right back to work with everything I requested; With enough time to write this long review as well. Thanks again Alexis your customer service is absoluty refreshing.,2
"I visited the Rome store on Turner McCall Blvd.  Lesley Osborne greeted me and helped me purchase my new 14 Pro phone.  She was friendly and patient with me.  I explained that I am an older user who did not grow up with cell phones, in fact our one phone per family was connected to the wall.  We had a great laugh and connection, and I could tell that she would be happy to help me if I needed to return. She also showed me options for an Apple Watch which I plan to purchase from her in the near future.  There was not a 14 Pro in stock, but she ordered it for me and it should arrive within 5-7 business days.  She reminded me to bring it back upon arrival and she would put the screen protector on and make sure my contacts are transferred!  THANKS!!",2

"Originally, I posted a review here about trouble I faced when upgrading my iPhone through AT&T. I encountered a frustrating issue since AT&T asked me to upload an ID to confirm my identity, but after the fact I realized they actually wanted my father’s ID (the account holder) as opposed to my own, which was not clear. Thereafter, every order I attempted to place on AT&T’s website was canceled apparently for security concerns.The promotion advertised to me for upgrading my phone was online only, which meant I could not simply place my order via phone or go to an AT&T store to skirt the issue.After making my issue known, AT&T proactively contacted me and followed up daily until the problem was completely resolved. This was unexpected from such a large company, and incredibly helpful at a time when I felt like I exhausted all avenues for upgrading my phone. I would like to thank AT&T and particularly Gary V. for their outstanding customer service and for fully resolving my issue.",2
"To: AT&T Customer Service TeamI am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service I received from Tricia S. at your AT&T Authorized Retailer, located at 1810 Library Street, Reston, VA 20190.During my recent visit to the store,I was assisted by Tricia, who exhibited the utmost professionalism, knowledge, and helpfulness.

"The AT&T store at 5012 4th Street N in St. Petersburg, FL is the best. Every member of the staff that I have met, including Justin, Austin, Todd, and the manager (whose name I didn't get) and wonderful. They are all very friendly, kind, personable as well as skilled and knowledgeable. When I look around the store, I see that it is not just me, but everyone who is having a good experience there.When the store was closing soon, Justin helped me without a problem. I noticed that he even helped some people who came in right at closing time, even though it meant that he started their transaction after closing time. That was above and beyond!Every phone I purchased from them has been great, until this last time when my phone was glitchy. Incredibly, they allowed me to trade it for a new one because I bought it less than two weeks ago. That will save me from a lot of hassle trying to repair the phone or work out the glitches with Apple.I highly recommend getting your next phone and wireless service from this AT&T store.",2
"I went to an AT&T store yesterday located in Interbay, to have my all my information from my old phone, downloaded to my new phone. There were two young ladies working in this store, both were very welcoming and sweet. Angelisa, who is helping me with my phone issues was one of the sweetest most helpful customer service person I have ever met, she not only took the time to show me a lot that my phone could do, and taught me taught me so much while she was working on my phone that I was just amazed at the customer service I received This young lady, Angelina has not worked very long at the store, but she was very knowledgeable about the iPhone and never once made me feel like I was a dummy. (Which I am when it comes to these phones) and I was very happy I I chose this store and very happy with the customer service I received. I had to deal with another phone company for a friend of mine who lost his phone and needless to say, that experience made me extremely happy I’m with AT&T. And with the experience I received yesterday from Angelina. I am customer for ever!",2
"I had a great interaction with the manager Courtney , she was professional and knowledgeable. Took great care of me!Christine Fowler-Neal",2
To be completely honest I love this company we never ever had a internet problem and it’s that good that when you go on the train and underground the video or whatever you are on is still playing the internet never stops. The price is good and the channels are amazing. Before they came to add our internet box and the cable boxes to the 3 tvs but we did have a issue were the controls didn’t seem to work because of the cable box it kept appearing a red light but then I reset it and they also said we had 100 dollars due when we payed everything but this is An amazing companyd I am so happy I changed back to this one because we changed to Optimum and it was the worst and super expensive so AT&T is awesome,2
"I have been trying to get service with AT&T but I’m not feeling good about the serviceAny ways I went store,the person work there helped me out everythingHer name is Valoric",2
I recently called AT&T to resolve a landline issue that I was having. The representative was both knowledgeable and courteous. Great service!,2
"I contacted AT&T via phone on 1/29/24 regarding a notice in my account that I could return my device and waive any remaining installment balance. It stated I had until July 31, 2024, to do this. I advised the representative that I planned to cancel my service and switch to another provider. The representative stated that the offer in my account was not valid and that AT&T does not allow returning a device past 30 days. I had the iPhone since 4/6/2022, so AT&T was aware that I had the phone in my possession for over 30 days. He did not attempt to provide any further information or keep my business. He also did not advise me that if I did not cancel before the start of my next billing cycle (which ended several days later) I would be charged an entire month of service. I previously had AT&T internet in addition to my wireless service and was only billed for the days/service used. I assumed this was the same for the wireless service. On 2/6/24, I ported my service from AT&T to another carrier. I am now being charged an entire month of service when once again, I canceled only 3 days after my billing cycle started and was never informed of this when I spoke to the representative on 1/29/24. Due to the false advertisement of being able to turn in my financed device at the current time, misinformation, and lack of quality cell phone service received from my time with AT&T, I am demanding my final bill be waived and my account settled as paid in full.3/2024 update - I was contacted by the company president who made things right. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and truly cared.",2
The check in was easy and little to no wait time to be seen by an employee and one of the employees Kiki was very helpful as I came in to get a new phone she was very hands on great knowledge and helpful she did amazing,2

"I was away in Alaska and I stopped receiving emails or being able to send them. I did receive before I left a bill. My credit card was compromised and I needed to give them my new credit card number. I received a confirmation that my $100 had been received. I photo shot the receipt. I called AT&T support while in Alaska to fix the email problem. I was on the phone for an hour and a half to no avail. I could not understand the gentleman on the line. Was told they were upgrading and I would have it restored in two days. Two days came and gone. I get home from my vacation. I get a text my service is being suspended due to lack of payment and I owed $213. I paid $100Of an $80 bill in May, now we are in the first week of June. I call support. I gave them my four digest code, said It didn’t work. I know it’s correct. Having difficulty understanding the person. After well over an hour I was told I needed to go to the store. I immediately went to the store in Raynham MA.  I met with the store manager Tyler Coward. He immediately assisted me. TookThe time to solve my dilemma. Found out they sent my first payment to the wrong account. My code was correct. Paid the correct amount, will be receiving a refund and am getting my emails. Tyler was awesome. Professional, helpful, understanding and solved my problem. I am grateful for him.",2

"Adam King, My man.For some context - I am moving and was shopping for internet for my new address. As I was browsing the website, I got a call from an number not trackable via google search.The rep said they were from AT&T and started asking for personal info such as my full name, number, home address and it was concerning from my perspective - getting a call from random number stating they are from AT&T asking for personal information after I tried to look up the number and didn't find anything.Dumb me, I gave it to them - and as soon as I did and they confirmed my address the line disconnects.I was worried and was thinking did I just get scammed?I called the phone number on the website and my man Adam King answers the phone. I called for two reasons - one, wanting to get service for a new address and two, talk about a call i just received asking for my personal info.I told Adam about what the conversation sounded like and we confirmed that it was indeed an actual AT&T Rep.but not only did we confirm the conversation I had with the unknown caller - he gave me a bunch of tips on how I can confirm with the caller to prove it's a legit person and also gave really good info on what scammers can do with certain information and assured me and said that good thing I didn't give more than just my address.I was so worried that I just got scammed and Adam gave me really good assurance.I'm just ranting at this point and i'm not really sure how to explain or talk about my gratitude and the way Adam handled my situation.HE IS THE BEST!This man was so informative and I'm so happy I got him as the person who answered my call.He went above and beyond to try and help me.@AT&T, please listen to the recorded conversation.He is amazing.We need more reps like him.",2

"I've been a longtime & faithful customer of AT&T for over 25 years. I have endured many unpleasant customer service reps over the years. After reaching my breaking point, with trade in issues, lost/stolen devices, bait & switches, & fraud, by Corporate AT&T Stores, I'd had enough. I called in on Wednesdays July 26th, to cancel my services & move all of my many lines to Verizon, despite the costs. When i called in I was already irritated from dealing with past insufficient reps, that had the empathy & customer service of a robot. I was greeted by ""AMBER FULLER"" in the customer loyalty department.  Immediately she greeted me with a true dedicated desire to help me, I had no idea what was in store for me! She quickly broke my walls of irritation down, & let me know that she was there to help & wouldn't get off of the phone until she resolved all of my problems, that she could clearly see were tons! When I tell you, she dove into the accounts in true shock, to realize everything I was stating was true, she was in disbelief, & Immediately started reaching out to managers of higher power, & to ensure that I was given a true resolution! She even got my number, & gave me her ID number & credentials to follow-up with me, to make sure all of my issues were resolved (we've all heard this before, right). Of course there were limitations on what she could do, but she put me in touch with those without limits. The very next day I was given a call by The President's Office, followed by an email with their contact info. Being in meetings I could not answer. Before I could even call back the next day, I received another call, & was able to answer this time it was ""April Witson"" from the President's office, she greeted me, & without me having to explain, plead my case, or beg for what was rightfully owed to me, 16 months in the making, for this incident. This is all because of the impeccable ground work done & notes done taken by ""AMBER FULLER"".April began to tell me, what was done to make me whole. An immediate retroactive credit was given that was applied immediately, no more waits, or fake business days, as i was told previously!!! ""AMBER FULLER"" even followed up as she promised she would. When I say my faith has been restored into AT&T, because of AMBER showing true empathy, genuine care, & loyalty: a repeated hellacious upgrade experience, will be no more! After 16 months of being wronged in this instance, because of ""AMBER"" I was finally made whole. For all of my AT&T needs going further I will always TRUST AMBER to get it done!!! AT&T honestly needs to reward her, & she truly needs to be a Customer Loyalty Training Manager. Because she truly exemplifies what a TRUE CUSTOMER LOYALTY REPRESENTATIVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. ""Hats off to ""AMBER FULLER' for truly being the best part of AT&T.",2
"I am an AT&T customer over twenty years. Over the years I have experienced the good the bad and the very bad! However on January 4, I went into the Plantation Sunrise store to upgrade my phone. My purse had been stolen a week before and I needed a new phone. I went the night before after 6:00pm. I was helped but it felt half- hearted that evening by the store associates. I left feeling extremely disappointed. They seemed uninterested in helping me and passed me along to two other associates. No one seemed to be tuned into what I needed and almost felt like I was left hanging. Half - hearted, no smiles and poor customer service. HOWEVER the next day I went back to give it another try and upgrade my phone … and by the luck of the draw, I got Carlos M! As the song goes, “ what a difference a day makes.” Carlos was smiling, happy to help me, took time with me to explain things and made me feel like an important customer who has been a loyal customer over twenty years. I felt valued and left with a smile and feeling great with my iPhone 15 upgrade!  I am not tech savvy and asked Carlos what he would want his mom to have. He said, “ my mom has a iPhone 15 and it’s a great phone! Me being a photographer, Carlos said I will love the camera quality. He set my phone up and showed me what I needed to do! This IS the kind of associate / employee you want to have working for you!! He was efficient, stayed focused and I felt sincerely tuned into and he was helping me. Maybe people have worked there for too long and need a break or a refresher course in customer service. Maybe the associates have forgotten how to look at customers and smile and look them in the face. Maybe it’s just become a boring, get my pay check and go job!  This plantation location on Sunrise  is my store that I go into for all my AT&T needs. I pay my phone bill there and browse the store looking for new products.  I am a business owner and have spend thousands and thousands of dollars with your company. Carlos saved me from ultimately having an unhappy experience and he saved AT&T from loosing a great customer. I hope he is recognized and valued with your company. He sure is with me! I thought you might like to hear positive feedback about a great employee!",2

"I’ve been having on again off again issues with att. A family member recently passed. Payment was delayed and our phones were turned off. When trying to explain my situation with Customer Service in an attempt to avoid having to pay the reconnection fee, to the customer service reps were very combative and rude. I paid the fee regardless to reinstate our lines. my elderly father is a part of the family plan. And did not want him to go without. Today I received a spam notification of my phone line being turned off. Spoke to customer service rep Stacy. She was completely the opposite and was very Kind and understanding. She helped me through the process of explaining my phone bill and assured I was not overdue on any payments. Even took the time to adjust the fee off that I had previously disputed with the other two reps. She has reinstated my hope in good customer service with this company. I should’ve gotten her last name. Thank you",2

Patient, knowledgeable and so easy to work with.  He explained everything thoroughly and answered every question, no matter how stupid.  (We are not very techie).

I was unaware of a cruise package and all the reps I spoke to said the international day package was sufficient. Well when  I got my bill this month it was 1,881.42 needless to say if I had knows about cruise package for 100.00 I would have bought it for sure. After calling “Bob” helped me get this all straightened out and my bill reflecting normal charges and the 100.00 cruise package added.

"I have read the terrible reviews for AT&T company and AT&T customer service and don't understand why a company lets this happen.I don't know so much about the company as a whole because our phones were purchased online by our daughter recently .  I do know there was one item ordered that was not included.  But that's another story.I want to write about a particular employee named Ty who was so very kind and helplful to me and helped set up our new phones for us.  I went into the Bloomingdale store in Brandon, Fl. a few months ago to get help with our old phones and the employee was less than helpful. So I hesitated to go back to that store.  But it is close so I decided to try again.  And Ty met me at the door and patiently guided me through the setup.  He did not receive a commission for a sale but was kind and courteous to an old lady.  So if you go to this store, just ask for Ty.",2

"I had the pleasure of working with Lewis of your AT&T office in Culpeper, VA.  I came to this office to get help with my new Series 3 Apple watch.  I am not very verse with these types of products. Right away Lewis was knowledgeable on the Series 3 watch.  He explained what needed to be done to get the watch up and running.  At one point I had to leave to do an errand and when I returned he was ready to finish the process. During our time when the phone was going through the pairing process with the watch, he gave me a great summary on the features of the Series 3.  Throughout the whole process Lewis was polite and very professional.  He was patient with me.  Because of him I will come back to this office.  I think he sets the bar for excellent customer service.  Thank you Lewis.Melissa Miles",2
"Today, my faith in FACE-to-FACE customer service has been restored. Phone assistance is not for the patience. Today, Scott (Att) at the AT&T Retail store next to Staples in Charlottesville was an honest down to earth advisor. Without a lot of fancy words explained to me why my new AT&T phone and Mom's PACE maker transmitter (AT&T carrier Phone) did not work in the location of Nelson County even thou it may have a Tower it didn't source out to AT&T. She has no internet nor WIFI. But with a prior purchased Orbit Speed he paired the AT&T phone to my Orbit Speed to allow my Mom's Unit to be monitored and likely save her health as it will allow remote adjustments now.  Blessings and gratitude to this dear Representative. If call there please tell his Supervisor and ask for Scott at 434-249-8454..",2

"I have a older ZTE phone (Pre Paid) which needed a card upgrade from 3G in order to recognize and run with the new 5G level. Justin Morgan, Asst. Manager of the Mount Vernon AT&T store, 7702F Richmond Hwy, VA  22306 was extremely helpful on three different occasions to target the problem and get my problem resolved. The card illusive to find. Once I found the card and received it from the main company, he sat with me while we made the call to ATT&T for the card to be formatted for my phone. He is the kind of person you would WANT to work with and would expect to find in an AT&T store when you need help. He knew the problem. He knew the phone, and he worked it through to the answers. He calmly listened, had a sense of humor and was pleasant to work. He is mature and has a demeanor well suited to handle higher positions of responsibility and is certainly an asset to AT&T. He's a keeper.",2

"I went to my local AT&T store (in north Winston-Salem, NC) a couple of nights ago, anticipating that I would be switching cell phone carriers.  Instead, my customer service agent Shady (yes, ironically, that was his name) listened to everything I had to say and ultimately advised me to buy a new cell phone elsewhere.  He understood that I am retired, living on a fixed income and unwilling and unable to pay $500 to $1000 for a phone.  Nor did I need to overload on gigabytes.  I use my phone for calls and texts and minimally for on-line searches.  Shady did not attempt to sell me any more than what I was asking for.  When I complimented him, he simply said, ""I try to give customers what they want.""  WHAT A CONCEPT!  I was impressed, went on line and purchased a refurbished phone and will continue as a loyal AT&T customer.  I have been with them for close to 20 years, after dumping Verizon for constantly bombarding me with ""offers"" to increase my bill.  Excellent customer service DOES still exist.  Thank you, Shady, for restoring my faith!",2

"I've been an AT&T customer for almost 10 years. I love them, they've always been good to me and helped me with any issues I had. Of course with any company there will be issues that arise but they have always worked with me to correct them. They value loyalty as much as I as I do and whenever I call the customer service I always reach a friendly, knowledge and helpful representative in a timely manner. I had an issue last year with someone committing fraud against me within a rival cellular company and AT&T was willing to help me prove the fraudulent activity and offered to get any documentation necessary to show the rival company that the person that opened that account wasn't me. Though their assistance didn't end up being needed due to me being able to prove fraud on my own, the fact they offered shows how loyal they're as a company. LOVE AT&T, 10 YEAR CUSTOMER & COUNTING. CUSTOMER 4EVER",2

I traded my phone for a new one. Appalonia was great with alot of knowledge and awesome customer service. Erin on the other hand was horrible. Customers came in 4 times asking questions as he sat in his chair like he didn't care. He is the reason people like me walk out and go somewhere else instead of at & t. This guy had an attitude in front of me with her and didn't seem to care. Ellsworth store in queen creek is great if appolonia is there but Erin should not be employed there,2

"Att customer service let me down on the phone, all I wanted was a line added to my account, a SIM card because we already had a phone. After being on the phone with them for almost an hour because they sent a suspended SIM card, they were of no help. They didn’t know what they were doing. So I hung up and drove to att store on s. MacArthur and explained to Melissa a wonderful lady with experience what was going on, it took a mere 15 minutes max for her to help and resolve the problem.What a waste of time to call customer service, no one is on the same page.So glad I went to att store!!!! Thank you Melissa!!!!!! She’s awesome! Okc, ok",2
"I spoke with sales rep Shaun Thompson via video chat on the AT&T website. He was extremely knowledgeable and provided excellent customer service. Great job AT&T for setting yourself apart (from pretty much all of corporate USA these days) by providing REAL PEOPLE & quality customer service vs. forced online chats, useless bots and endless wait times.",2
"I was just in the Upton AT&T store today. I needed a new phone! Keyon is the name of the young man that helped me! I am 69 years old and will be 70 in Sept.

I will recommend AT&T to family & friends!Linda Johnson-Clark",2
"WOW! I have never been wowed by customer service representative over the phone before until now. Marybelle (I believe that’s how you spell her name?) is the complete epitome of what a customer service representative should be like. From great and happy attitude, to helpfulness and getting straight to resolving the issue at hand - she is just outstanding. She was very personable and related to me and my issues. She was aware of my problem, and quickly after fixing that one, she was able to offer me an upgraded plan that would be extremely beneficial to me. Yes, every salesperson’s job is to sell an upgrade to the customer, but she knew her queue when to discuss about it without sounding pushy or robotic, as if she was reading some type of script. She was very knowledgeable about her work, which allowed her to naturally flow into a very affordable upgrade plan that would blow my current plan out of the waters.I was going to do these steps for myself on the app anyway, but maybe I would have overlooked it if it wasn’t for her recommendation. I’m truly grateful. I never write these type of reviews. She made my morning. And let’s be honest, not many people can say that about their mobile service providers and representatives. Very well spoken, helpful, and knowledgeable. GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE OR A PROMOTION! Well deserved, IMO.",2

"On 12/23/2021 I entered the AT&T store in Robinson Mall with what I thought what's a complicated problem. At that time I was greeted bye a young lady named Kalie D. When I told her I had a complicated problem he asked me what the problem was and then said oh that's not complicated I can help you and boy did she, she got me the best deal that I've ever gotten on a cell phone plan and for that I say thank you. I sure hope that AT&T knows what kind of an outstanding employee that they actually have with Kalie D. I personally think that this kind of an employee who goes above and beyond to help the customer and the company to get a promotion and or a raise she does deserve it",2
I had been with Sprint 20 years.— when T-Mobile merged the service went downhill. I decided to give AT&T a try. So glad I did! their coverage is great. I have 5G coverage even in my rural area. Their plans are flexible.c customer service is friendly and timely. I can get an expert right to my door to deliver new equipment and make sure it is set up correctly.During my contacts with customer service they have been flexible and willing to work outside the box to make sure my needs were addressed.I recently got a Great international calling plan and they even backdated the plan so that it would cover a call I had already made.I feel like they really value my business.,2

"My wife and I needed to update our phones.  We went to the AT&T store at 835 Central Park Avenue in Scarsdale, NY.   The process takes some time, so we were able to observe several customer interactions witb the reps.  All were curteous, patient and helpful.  We want to give a special compliment to the rep who helped, Mazen Alkhouri.  He was just terrific.  We are seniors and like many of us, we are not technologically savvy.  He carefully and clearly explained everything.  We forgot our AARP card and had to go back home to get it.  When we returned he took up right where we left off.  At the end of the encounter he gave me his  mobile number and offered to give further help by texting.  Turned out that I was OK, but it was good to have him available.  The sales consultant job is stressful, but Mazen and his co-workers were unflappable, even in the face of some weird questions.  Way to go, everyone,  but especially Mazen.",2

"I received courteous service with a lot of smiles, patience and understanding. It was a very pleasant experience with your knowledgeable personnel. The only problem I’ve found so far is that the charging cords I bought do not fit the new iPad which I must say was an unpleasant discovery since my other ATT devices use the former charger cords.The staff at the Borger Texas store are an asset to your company.

"***This is a ""customer service"" review regarding employee ""Justin"" @ AT&T in the Logan Valley Mall (5580 Goods Ln.) in Altoona, PA.Not knowing a lot about modern phone systems, I was having issues trying to re-up my ""Auto-Pay"" payment plan through AT&T.I ventured into the AT&T store at the Mall for some much needed assistance, but wasn't sure what to expect.After entering the store, a younger gentleman, Justin, approach me with a nice smile and, what seemed, a good attitude.  As we have been forced to do these days, I was skeptical at first of what was to come.Justin put me at ease, understood my problem and went right to work in a professional manor.  After 10 minutes of doing ""this and that"" he informed me I was GTG.  He even gave me his cell number to use if he wasn't available at the store and I needed his help/advise.  (Older folks, remember when this was the norm, the good attitude, the willingness to help and the problem solving solutions?)He was right on top of things!!!So, in summation, please keep Justin and folks like him on board within your company.  Though the days of ""customer service"" have fallen off dramatically over the last decade or so, it was a great experience meeting and dealing with Justin.  If/when I head back in to the AT&T store, I'll be searching for Justin!Many thanks for your help Justin.Pleased customer, john stoyanoff",2
"I would love to thank Wanda Steele at the Airport BLVD location in Mobile, AL for solving an issue created by and failed to solve by the main AT&T support, and Wanda took 3:55:00 less time resolving it.

Thanks a million, Wanda, because you made it worth the 170 miles I drove to find you by chance: a true professional and problem solver 😁.",2

"My husband and I have been AT&T customers since August of last year. We traded in our phones at the AT&T store at the Oxford Commons in Oxford Alabama. We have been treated like crap by the store manager all the way down to the sales associates. We were lied to about how much we would pay for the new phones and they even lost one of the phones and said we never sent it in. Well they are right we never sent it in..... THEY SENT IT IN!!! And now I have proof. We were in Sylacauga Alabama today working and just happened into the AT&T store here in Sylacauga. Ashlee Dalton, the store manager, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to answer our questions and actually cared about our situation and helped us with our plan. We are so disappointed in the Oxford Store and will never go back to them for anything! We will be bringing our business to the Sylacauga store from now on, even though it’s an hour from our house, because they want to help instead of make the customer feel worse than when they walk in. A BIG Thank you to Ashlee Dalton!!!!!! Give this girl a raise because she deserves it!!!!! This should be the example for ALL of the AT&T stores.",2
"Employee Arielle was very helpful and she has helped me the last two times I have been there, I'm not very knowledgeable about cellphones,she has always answered any questions I have had and resolved my problems everytime,she is great!",2

"I must say, of it weren't for Eddie Mille #emistr, I woulda cancelled them Friday. He was so nice and helpful. I've been a good customer for many years and again, because of him, I did not go to Comcast. You have a great guy working for you!",2
"I would like to give special recognition of AT&T Lansing store employee Audrey.Store address: 3201 E. Grand River Ave. suite C Lansing, MI 48912I had a Wi-Fi technical difficulty issue that we’re not be able to be solved over the phone with AT&T customer service. So I talk to Audrey about my problem, she was on the phone continuously for almost 1 hour and 45 minutes and talked to multiple personnel to resolve my technical issue and ultimately found a good solution. I am very impressed with her customer service. Thanks for people like her made us very happy customers.",2
"I was looking into cell phone carriers.  I went into the Waterstone AT&T without an appointment and was very impressed with their care.  In particular, Tammy Pollen, was so helpful!  Our experience couldn't have been any better, and we are very grateful for her help. Thanks, Tammy!",2
"This review is specifically for the employee (ID # WW068E - Will). I switched my TV service from U-Verse to ATT-TV on 6/18/21. I started trying out with one cable box for a week and I liked it. So I went back to store and order three more boxes on 6/26/21. I received one box on 6/29/21. I went back to store a week after and explained them the situation regarding two more boxes were I never arrived. They called ATT customer service over the phone and I was told that they were shipping out more and I should be getting them in four days. I never received them. I went back to store two more times every week and nothing happened. So finally I decided to call ATT customer service from home myself. This is when I talked to Will and he understood everything what was going on in my situation. He assured me to help out as best as he can. He worked with me the whole time I was on the phone and he started the process right away. He told me that he'd call me back as soon as he confirmed my order. As he promised, he called back a couple of hours later and gave me all the information on the order. I received my two boxes the next day. Will is the kind of person customers like to work with and he is the one can keep the ATT customer service standard high. He deserves promotion or big raise for his good work.The previous three customer service before Will I got in touch with, either they are incompetent or lazy to do their job. They should be fired and hire more people like Will to rebuild ATT customer service.",2
Dean Daneshm was the most sweetest and compassionate and knowledgeable person ever.  I was very upset coming in because my car was broken into and used Assurian insurance to get a phone.  Dean was sooo patient and walked me through on set and kept assuring me that everything will be good.  Not okay - but good.  The kindness he showed - was beyond amazing.  Dean is tremendous at the Huntington Beach store - on Brookhurst and Adams.......,2
"I go to the AT&T store in Fenton, Mi. On Silver Lake Parkway. My husband & I have nothing but praise for this service we have received over the years. We would like to commend Kyle who helped me with an IPad problem that was urgent. There was a virtual baby shower going on for my niece & being my first time on Zoom, I was having trouble accessing the meeting. I quickly drove up to the AT&T store & even though it was closing Kyle opened the door & helped me with my problem.Needless to say, I was able to join my niece’s shower & I am very grateful to Kyle.Most recently, I could not find my IPhone & thought I lost in a local restaurant. I could notfind it anywhere at home. After searching for the phone & that included the restaurant, my husband & I drove to the AT& T store & Lance, the store manager , took charge of things & through a computer program was able to locate my phone which was tucked under a table.. I am so grateful. Thanks, Lance & Kyle,, you’re the best.",2
"I was recently provided exceptional customer care by Larnelle Dabney at AT&T. He was very kind, patient, understanding, helpful and he was just brilliant at his job, and he solved my issue with utmost professionalism. He should get a raise and be acknowledged as a valuable team member.",2
"I can't find where to put this so I guess here's fine, BUT AT&T GIVE MARK A RAISE PLEASE. This man went above and beyond to make sure we were takin care of. Including walking up our driveway when we forgot to open the gate for him, and helping to explain to me and my little sister how to set up the app, what the app looks like, etc. He was very kind the whole time he was here, even gave us his personal phone number for if we had any questions.",2
Jacoby Barber at the AT&T store in Morganton didn't give up until the issue I was having with my phone was resolved. He even stayed over passed his quitting time until my phone was back in service.  Thank you Jacoby!,2
"I have been trying to get assistance from the 800# customer service representative with absolutely no luck. I just kept going in circles when my issue should have been resolved the previous month. If there’s any day you feel you don’t have enough stress in your life then call the at&t 800# and try to get assistance. I ended up going to the AT&T store in Selmer, TN where Cody handled my issue quickly and professionally. I spent less time with Cody than on the phone with basically no stress. Now I am waiting to see if the account is credited correctly for the return of my previous phone. Overall, I think at&t needs to have someone like Cody train their telephone staff in how to handle customer issues. Great job, Cody!",2
I have a wonderful  experience at the Att in Tuscaloosa on 69.DJ and Tyler was exclent in helping with my needs.Good job guys!!,2
My mother and I went to the Ambassador Caffery location and received the best service from Andre. He went over and beyond trouble shooting her old phone and was very professional when he told her she needed a new one.  She did purchase a new phone and will definitely recommend anyone to this location and to ask for Andre.,2
"The customer service at the memorial store in Murfreesboro, Tn was excellent! Ti-ara was so helpful. She helped mutiple people while I was there and kept everything moving smoothly!",2
"Randy and David was the sweetest. I really like Randy. Hes a super star. Hes the nicest guy there. They were nice, kind, loving, patient, and caring. They were earnest and genuine. They worked hard. They weren't rude or anything. I had a pleasant experience.  A good experience at the att store.  The plans are affordable.  Great phones. Nice store. Convenient locations.  Friendly staff. Not too overpriced.  Not too cheap. Not much to complain about. I wouldn't go to any other carrier. I'm happy with att. The plans are great. I really like the phones. Compared to other cellular phones carrier I like att best. I've tried it all. They were either wack or overpriced and way too expensive.  Too costly. The monthly bills were astounding for other carriers. Show respect and you'll get respect. That's basic.",2
"We were at the Crossroads, Rochester, MN, store this afternoon and spent over two hours with Kenny Temple.  He was more than patient and helpful in pairing my hearing aids to my phone and making adjustments on the phone app.  In addition, he spoke to the audiologist and a hearing aid representative to get additional information.We were very pleased with his professionalism, determination, and honesty. He did not encourage me to purchase a new phone which would not have solved the problem.",2
I recently purchased a new phone from  your highway,2
"This is regarding a Retail Sales Consultant, Nicole S. Soto. As soon as I walked into the ATT store, I was greeted by this lovely young lady.  She went over and above her call of duty to assist me.  It was a pleasure dealing with Ms. Soto and believe she is definitely an asset to your company.",2
"I see all of these bad reviews about AT&T but the experience my fiancé and I had was very different from the other reviews. We went to the AT&T store in Fredericksburg, the one off of Carl D Silver Parkway..... Coty Hetrick was the one that took care of us! He was absolutely AMAZING!! If I could give him 10 STARS I WOULD!!! But I hope we don’t get any hidden charges like I heard happens to a lot of people so we will keep an eye on our bills but other than that great customer service thanks Coty for helping us with everything 👍✌️",2
"I am writing this review and rating it 5 stars based solely on David Thewis, retail sales consultant. David was the only employee that followed through to help me  get my money back after being told one thing about a phone upgrade deal and being charged an entirely different amount than promised. He was consistent and stuck to his word about doing all he could to help me get what I was promised. I have been with AT&T for at least 10 years and the ONLY reason I am staying with them at this time is because of this employee. He deserves a raise and recognition! In the future I will not be doing trade ins or upgrades without clear written statements. Thank you David.Jen",2
"I had some of the best customer service I’ve had anywhere at AT&T! I went to the Springfield OH location and Tyler G was Amazing! I’ve been a Verizon customer since I had my first phone and never thought about switching. But decided to stop by AT&T, and do not regret it.Tyler answers all my very complex questions and made sure to get me exact phone and plan I needed. He was professional and went above and beyond with service. I cannot thank him enough! Even though the whole process took less than 30 min, I really felt like family. If you want to switch or are looking to upgrade, Tyler is the man!Thanks a bunch!",2
"We are very limited with what internet provider we can get where we live. But we signed up for AT&T and the next morning, Anthony came by the house to hook up a wire for our modem. He climbed the pole across the street and on our property and brought it to the house within probably an hour and at no charge. Xfinity wanted to charge us $700 to do the exact same thing. The tech was very nice and explained everything and he left us his contact info in case we have any further questions. Very good service, so far!",2
"I needed a technical support re my email on my phone and I came to the Midway/ Tamiami store to get my email working.After a friendly greeting an office manager ,Nick ,assisted me and he was very kind and understanding (I am an older person)I couldn’t be happier with the service. I highly recommend ATT and their staff .",2

"My husband and I went to the ATT store on Bardstown rd on April 21 to upgrade our phones. It took longer than expected but that’s okay, Emily took good care of us. She knew her stuff! Even worked through her lunch to help us. So glad we came to this location, thank you Emily, you’re the best !",2
"I just want to say that the team at 3899 VETERANS MEMORIAL PARKWAY STE K, AT&T Store, ST PETERS, MO 63376 is very helpful - Everytime I go in there they go above and beyond for me and others.  Beth and Chris M are great - so much knowledge and didnt hesitate to help with all my questions and needs",2
"Had a very good experience with Richie at AT&T Ashtabula Ohio store. Very knowledgeable,very patient and professional. He handled all our needs while waiting on others in between. He is very good at his job. Thank you Richie.",2
Awful company! I have been a long time customer and they don't care. They will use misleading information to suck you in and charge you for something you didn't know you were getting. There online deals are a lie! They are not clear or accurate. Do not trust this company. They will steal your money by offering a deal and then taking it away!UPDATE- Att has contacted me after this experience and has been wonderful in resolving this issue! There was some confusion and they have made it right. Thank you very much! Christina was so kind and helpful. Some of the best customer service I have had in awhile. I will be staying with this company.,2
"Visited AT&T store on New York Street Aurora, IL.  Dealt with a Consultant named Mirza Orozco.  She was unbelievable at her job and went above and beyond to satisfy my issues.  I have transferred over 4 lines and know if I have any issues who to call.",2
Nicholas was great excelent customer service had a wonder full experiance,2
"Today, March 8th, I called At&t to stop my service at 8:35 PM and was not looking forward to my call after my previous interaction with a customer service agent was abrasive and largely unhelpful. I was left on hold for a long time, which I understand on a Monday call volume much be high, but this still did not contribute to a great experience. Then, the customer service agent who answered immediately made my experience a great one! She was so kind, clear, and was very intent on making sure that not only was my concern being taken care of but that I was having a positive customer experience. She was so informative, and was incredibly warm, empathetic and friendly. My service request was taken care of quickly, and she let me know exactly how to do the next steps. I think that the rest of the team could definitely be taking some lessons from her!",2
AT&T is one of the best service phone places out here there customer service is great and welling to help you with any problem that you may have on seller device.,2
"I went to the Arlington Branch again after leaving out the first time. My new phone Contact list had not downloaded by the time I reached home. I had to return to the store to have that added. Once again the staff, especially Charles was very helpful. I appreciate the experience I’ve had at this Branch.",2
"Cody at the Bluemound Rd. Waukesha, Wisconsin store provided amazing customer service for my mother, today. We recently switched from Verizon to AT &T.  To date, most of our experience has not been positive.The transition has required a lot of hours between my son first making the switch, to bringing me and my other son and parents onto AT & T.  It seems either the sales people in Stuart, Florida (where my son and I live) didn’t set things up properly (after hours of us spending time with them in the store) or the transfer process is not properly communicated to all AT & T staff.  Not only did my son (who is the account holder) spend 8+ hours between the Stuart store and corporate (on the phone) setting up his service and straightening out charges to his account, but my other son and I spent 3+ hours at the Stuart store only to spend another 2 hours on the phone the next day finding out the “porting” didn’t work properly; then my mom (in Wisconsin) had several difficulties setting up my dad’s new phone that we bought in Stuart and had shipped to him in Wisconsin.Our phone charges are a mess; very difficult to determine if we were ultimately charged appropriately (we’re still trying to figure it out).Now today, my mom (who is the only one who kept her “new” phone purchased thru Verizon before knowing we would be transitioning service to AT&T) all of a sudden could not make calls or receive calls.  I tried (from Florida) to help her figure out the problem, but had no luck.  We called her Waukesha store and Cody took our call.  He offered a solution that wouldn’t work for my mom.   He told my mom he could definitely help her with her SIM failure if she came to the store; which she did.  Cody found the problem and fixed it within minutes!I called to personally thank Cody.  I explained to him that my parents no longer have a landline phone, so they rely on their cell phones.  My dad’s health is very poor and he is not very mobile.  So, when he needs my mom’s assistance, he HAS to be able to reach her.  Today, he needed my mom and she was at the store running errands.  He couldn’t reach her by phone, so he texted “HELP!”  Imagine how scary that was for them both?  It is imperative that my parents have reliable phones and phone service.Cody’s assistance today was extremely valuable.  I hope his manager and superiors see this post.  There is definitely room for improvement for the company to make the transition process from another cell phone service to AT & T a more seamless and less time consuming one.  The consumer’s time is just as valuable as the company’s time.Cody, thank you, again, for restoring my mom’s ability to make and receive calls.  You are much appreciated!",2
"We have AT&T for internet and cable only. Recently we have had several strange issues with the hardware, and they have made it so easy to get help. For a few issues, as soon as I call their help number a computer does a test on my services and then quickly diagnoses it and allows me to schedule a tech visit for the next day. If the computer doesn't find anything wrong, it immediately connects me to a person who was so helpful. In an age where it seems increasingly hard to get help, their customer service is outstanding!",2
"Deshawnta Houston at the Florissant,MO AT&T store is a rock star!!! I recently transferred phone and tv services at a Sam’s wholesale to AT&T and they screwed up everything. I had to take it in to the AT&T store and Deshawnta went above and beyond to help my situation. Everything was resolved but when I canceled my directTV apparently the online customer service rep canceled EVERYTHING. I gave Deshawnta a call, told her what happened and she dropped everything to assist me once again. She was pleasant, patient, knowledgeable, and immensely helpful with my situation. Had it not been for her I would’ve canceled everything and gone back to my old services. I’m still dealing with the loss of AT&T TV, but she’s helping me out.",2
"Today, I contacted ATT about being billed for my damaged IPhone ( $1049.00). I had returned the phone in late December 2020 and they apparently never received it. ATT ProTech was very understanding and began research.  He referred me to the warranty department and said they could research the USPS tracking number.  At this point, I talked to Victoria, based in Texas.  She was super helpful and courteous. She apologized for putting me on hold and began her research. Victoria located the tracking number and found out the package has been lost in transit. After talking to her supervisor, she arranged to have the amount credited to my account, since it wasn’t my fault the package was lost.  The excellent care and concern  Victoria gave to my issue made my day!",2
"Recently we needed to upgrade one of our phones and review the options for our phone plan that included 5 phones plus we wanted to add another phone line. We made an appointment at the AT&T Park Avenue store in Little Rock, Blake was our tech. Blake was amazing! We had lots of questions, Blake was patient when we didn't understand, and kept going over everything until we understood all the details. It was a great experience, we would recommend AT&T and Blake to anyone.  We've been with AT&T for thirteen years and have always had this type of attention and care not only from Blake but any of the tech's we've  worked with over the years.",2
"Sending out thanks and appreciation for the outstanding services I received from the employees from the AT&T store at 217 Broadway, New York, New York.

"As a 20 year customer of Comcast and having become tired of their lack of customer service, I made the decision to switch to ATT. We are at the border of their service area but were assured that they could adequately provide coverage. At first, that was not the case but one call was all it took to get the problem looked at and then, very quickly, fixed at no cost to us. I could not be happier with the product and the service.",2
I was recently at the Cape Coral store on Santa Barbara Blvd.. I took my elderly neighbor there to replace his phone. Carlie was the person who helped us.

Amazing experience! Kristen Chorn is the best att has to offer she is #1! The amount of enthusiasm and positivity she has is next level. The amount of professionalism she welcomed me with was highly appreciated. I really want to thank her for solving my issue with a trade in. The promptness and kindness presented was incredible. Att give her a huge promo she deserves it. The best this site has to offer in customer service I’ve spoken to many representatives but what she has done and the kindness was next level as I said ; Kristen Chorn #1 in customer satisfaction (should be awarded with this).,2
"On Dec. 25th my service went down right in the middle of a Lyft ride!  The bomb that blew up in Nashville caused the shut down of ALL AT&T services.  I was in a panic the next day because I needed to make money to pay my bills & rent!!  I went to the S. Church St. location & found out from Julian, Retail Sales Consultant what happened.  He explained everything to me as several other costumers were coming in to the store angry wanting to cancel!  It was such a horrible disaster!  I stayed calm, listened to other costumers complaints/issues and decided to go to Wal-Mart to buy a Straight Talk phone so I could get driving for Lyft & Uber.  Well, now the real drama begins for me! After the craziness @ Wal-Mart with all the AT&T customers buying all their phones, waiting in line for hours & trying to get my Lyft & Uber accounts on my new phone, I decided to go back to Julian @ AT&T for help.  I brought my laptop & new Straight Talk phone to seek help.  I connected to the WIFI next door @ Dunkin Donuts and attempted to get my new phone number connected to my Lyft & Uber accounts.  After the hours of endless drama that ended around 3pm, I was able to get on the road driving for Lyft & Uber to make money!  This whole process began at 10am @ the AT&T store and ended their @3pm!!  Thanks to Julian helping me figure this out, I made enough money to cover my rent!  I will forever be grateful for the service & help that he gave me that day!",2
"I spoke with Jayd today over the phone to help me with my login issues and autopay card change to my at&t prepaid account.Jayd was very nice and helped me fix everything.  She did not try to sell me other stuff in the middle of fixing my account issues, and I thank her abundantly because when they try to sell additional stuff while fixing your issues, it gets confusing and more mistakes to happen.If you get Jayd on the phone, you are in good hands at at&t prepaid!Julz McN.January 18, 2021",2

"I had trouble with my bill being too high and was given "" DELANO"" was my rep that helped me get thing  fixed and helped me with other problems. Delano was the best and helpful rep I have EVER had in all the years that I have been with at At&t. He was so kind and helpful and told me just calm down I here to help you.("" I get anxiety when I don't know what exactly what I am doing."") He kept calming me down and told me I won't leave you. He deserves a raise and promotion. If I could get Delano every time I called for help .I would stay with At&t for ever. Please help him with some kind of of raise or promotion. He is one of you BEST.  Thank you, Patti Johnstone",2

"I WORKED WITH ATT!!! and here's the tip whenever you call for promotion discount or any to lower your bill take it from me, call the customer service and here what exactly you gonna say  ""I WANT TO CANCEL MY SERVICE UNLESS YOU HAVE BETTER DEAL"" thats magic word for them and u know what? They will transfer the call immedietly to the higher person which is loyalty that really do promotion, and just in case they dont have anything for you either? If you have contract finish it so you wont pay etf but if you dont, feel free to cancel the service and then call again after the effectivity of cancellation, place new order so you can enjoy new benefits again.Its funny, people thought if they are loyal to company, theyll have much better price, well yeah like 5% maybe and most of them just using dial up landline lol, so you folks must know how it really works, its not what you think it is, like c'mon! its business, i have worked with spectrum and verizon they do the same, it just that i stayed long with att cuz believe or not, there are more satisfied customer than them.( its true less stress when handling calls)And last thing! Always be kind to all representative, they can do much better unless you are stupid.",2
"It took 4 months but with hard work and dedication, I was able to get my specific business number activated. It wasn't any of the 5 reps that talked too about this, it was the last guy I talked to (forgot his name). The only reason I left a 5 star is because ATT was finally able to activate the number I specifically wanted : )",2
"Love it!! We have had their cell phone & home high speed internet wifi service for over a year. Just recently two hurricanes Laura and Delta hit us and took all cell towers down. Nobody had cell service, internet access, or cable for over a month. Low and behold my husband never lost cell service and we were the only people in the area that had wifi. That wifi saved us! It allowed us to keep in touch & let everyone we were alive & ok. Plus get all the info we needed to survive at that time to find food, water, etc.. I want to say Thank You!! You literally saved us with your dependable service! Not sure what wouldve happened if we wouldnt have had your service. It didnt just help us, it helped others in my community too since we were the some of the only ones with service. Our family and friends are grateful.",2
"On 27 December 2020, my mom and I went to the AT&T store located at 5705 Centennial Center Blvd, Suite 110, location in Las Vegas.  We were fortunate to have Juan Campos Ortiz assist us.  I needed a new sim card installed due to a mishap with my account.  Juan read the notes in the file, replaced the sim card, informed us of new AT&T Offers.  I asked how to transfer my photos to a thumb drive.  He didn't look at me like I was crazy. He politely answered my question and even asked if I had other questions or concerns.  He was polite, knowledgeable, and professional.  I can't say that about the location on Durango.  This is now my location.  Thanks Juan.",2

I had a hard time getting  my internet hooked up. Robert Davis came out to my townhouse  in Cumming ga in a timely fashion. The thing i like the most about Robert is he called when he was on the way and showed up early and got my internet fixed. Not only did he get my internet working but he went the extra mile and got my tv connected to the internet.Anyone in the area should ask for Robert Davis to come to your home to get your service hooked up.,2
I recently visited Bastrop Texas 78612 location for a Hot Spot issue. The device stopped working and it was under warranty. Initially there was issues but the manager Tony Leon took charge and turned the problems around. I have been with AT&T for over 30 years and I did not want to end my relationship.

She spent 40 minutes with me listening to my concerns and answering every question I had that would benefit me. She took care of all of my problems and even discussed my current plan to help me find something affordable as I expressed my concerns as a college student. This is how you do customer service. I can’t even thank her enough and because of her, I will stay with AT&T. If it wasn’t for her, I would have turned my phone in and switched plans. She is AMAZING!!!!",2
"I had to make a call this morning to inquire about the access program you offer.I was warmly greeted by a lady named Geraldine. She was very informative and so polite and respectful. She is a prime example of how customer service should be and one of the best I've ever spoken to. I hope At&t treats exemplary employees like her as they should, like gold ! You are lucky to have her !",2
"I recently purchased a new galaxy phone and I needed help transferring all my data over from the old galaxy.  Long story short I stopped in the retail store on 10/8/20 at 7372 two notch rd, Columbia, SC around 1245pm before work.  I met the two salesmen who were there and they were so knowledgeable and helpful the whole time.  I heard one of their names.  It was Travis.  I did not catch the other one's name unfortunately, but he took the lead from the jump, showing me how to transfer all my files and making sure everything worked before I left.  Travis was helpful too. Even when the transfer failed the first time, he reset it and tried again until it worked.  I have been a customer of ATT since 2008.  I have never had any problems with them and their customer service is outstanding.  Thank you Travis and the other kind gentlemen!  My phone is working great!",2
"I had issue related to my at&t data and Nicholas (KHK7DC6) has made sure I got the required support and instruction. He has called back when my phone got disconnected in the middle of troubleshooting session. I greatly appriciate the customer service I got from, Nicholas! Thank you.",2
Rupert was so amazing he provided excellent customer service and helped me resolve my issues! Highly recommend if you need help he’s the go to man. !!!!,2
I want to compliment Victoria Phillips Metcalfe at the Richmond Hill GA store. She was very helpful and professional! Thanks for the smooth transition of trading in the old phone and buying my daughters new phone.  Cathy Kee,2
"After my ordeal with Sprint I transferred my two lines to AT&T.  Anthony and his team located on Boston Rd in Springfield, MA, are amazing.I walked in and in the course of 30 minutes he transferred my lines from Sprint.  This is my review of Sprint and how unprofessional they are and how Anthony and his team fixed my problem.#I1998543450We have had lines with sprint for over 13 years.  At the end a total of 5 lines.  i called to separate 2 lines and what should have taken 15 minutes took over 2 hours to do.  Completely uneducated agents/representatives/supervisors/managers.  I was not able to respond to my clients which i do over the phone.  I lost clients/business.  I then called to complain and was transferred to more unprofessional/uneducated supervisors/managers that claimed they could do nothing for me.  This escalated to over 7 hours in the course of 3 days of wasted time and energy and lost clients/business.  I finally had the pleasure of speaking with Chenn, a representative that clearly knew what she was doing.  She unlocked the phone and refunded my pay off to the locked phone which i gladly paid in order to transfer my lines to AT&T that same day.  That is what i did.  This was completely unprofessional.  Pathetic.  Highly recommend to not use this company.  Chenn was amazing.  That is the only god thing i have to say.  She needs a raise and she should be training Sprint's supervisors/managers.",2
Went to my local At&t store and Erica Gonzalez answered all my questions. Great employee. Will highly recommend Erica.,2
"Natasha does her job well she has the customer service i expect and I can tell she's a sweetheart as a person.Att is very fortunate to have her if she ever comes to Missouri i would certainly love to take her out for dinner. She deserves the best may God bless her and her familySincerely, skot",2
"I called and was helped with extreme kindness and care from an AT&T representative named Jordin or Jordyn. She spent over 2 hours helping me fix an error on my account and I am overjoyed with her assistance, thabk you again Jordin.",2
"I just went into the San Clemente AT&T store off Pico and was helped by Johsua. Not only was he incredible professional and was able to quickly diagnose and solve my issues, he was able to multi task and help another person at the same time without either of us feeling neglected. Great job Joshua- you’re an asset to the company!!",2
I was pleased from my experience in the US,2
"Patrick Pichon with the Beglis - Sulphur, Louisiana Office has gone upon and beyond any representative I have every encountered.  Not only did he earn my personal but complete company business.  He assisted two of my employees and two of my current tenants with their conversion and/or AT&T services.  He answered his phone and/or returned my call immediately when available to assist.  I must say even on his day off due to bereavement of his own mom unknown to me at the time of call he assisted me and one of my employees.  Cheers to such a very dedicated employee.",2
"I’m trying to figure why so many morans are giving AT&T bad reviews. I’ve been a loyal customer for  decades and I have never had any issues with my cellphone. Works every time. Data , internet, etc. super fast . If they pay their bill on time then maybe they wouldn’t have any problems. AT&T is not cheap but they sure are worth every dime. Pay your bill and stop crying  crybabies.",2
"I absolutely love the service I have received from AT&T. I have cable and internet service. I recently switched my cell phone carrier to AT&T as well. The customer service I received is phenomenal! Westland, MI AT&T store experience was one of the best I’ve had in a while. A special “Thank You” to the staff at the location on Warren and Central City Parkway. You guys are truly amazing!",2
I just had a great retail sales consultant help me to purchase a phone her name is Sandy Woller. She was super helpful in ideas of what I would like for my phone very easy to talk to she deserves 10 stars you are great Sandy they should be proud to have you as an employee,2
"I encountered spectacular customer care today when trying to migrate from ""traditional"" AT&T ""Postpaid"" Wireless to the less-expensive AT&T ""Prepaid"" Wireless and migrate 3 existing phone lines.  A woman out in Georgia named ""Via"" went far beyond my expectations and kept after the problem for over 2 1/2 hours- long after other AT&T employees gave up or 'dropped the ball'.  She works in the Loyalty department, and even though I was ""leaving"" the 'traditional' side of the company, at no time was she in any way rude, negative or unpleasant.  In fact she tirelessly attacked the problem and REFUSED to give up.  I will write directly to the president of the company and give my applause and appreciation.  Truly exceptional service.  Even though it took a lot of time to complete - Via was willing to stay beyond her 'official end of shift' to see me succeed.  That was incredibly generous of her and much-appreciated!",2
"great service ,very patient w me and they understand the frustrations of getting good service..",2
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Parker AT&T location. Warren and Deven both helped me out until all my needs were met. I love my new phone :),2
My name is JW I live in Guthrie  OKLAHOMA. I go to the AT&T store to pay my Internet bill and my phone bill. When I go to the AT&T store I make sure Billy is working because knows what he is doing when it comes to the AT&T phones and the paying your bill process.I payed my bill one month and the next time I went to pay my bill AT&T said i had not payed my bill. Billy got on the phone with them and stayed on the phone almost two hours until he got things fixed. They have messed up my bill more than once and he always knows how to fix it. If it was not for Billy I would have left AT&T and went to another phone company.Billy always has a good attitude when i come into the store. He needs to be paid more money or he should be a manager of a store to teach other employees how to treat customers .I was in the store a week ago and Billys boss was in the store with him and my bill was f up again Billy and his boss fixed it she was wonderful also seeing how i was mad and not happy.I have been with AT&T for a long time and there have bee other people work in that store who did not know what the hell they were doing and treated me like I was wasting there time. Billy IS THE MAN THANKS BILLY FOR ALL YOU DO.,2
At&t scottsburg indiana gave me wonderful service. Prompt and courteous and helpful.,2
"Ti-ara at the Murfreesboro, Tn S. Church store was amazing. She went the extra mile and helped with anything needed. Excellent customer service.",2
"It has been quite some time since we have had BAD static on our 3 landline phones, even though we have cell phones as well.  I keep the landline phone because of hearing problems, and I have a machine that gives details when someone calls in to help, as well.  The static on our phone has been bad for 6 months or longer, and even people leaving messages on the landline phone, we could hear nothing of what they were saying, or even to call out on the phones. I decided after all this time that I have been paying the AT&T bill, we needed to find out why there was so much static on our phone all the time.  I made the call today, and within 30 minutes, Craig McMillin (I ask his name, but I'm not for sure of the correct spelling of the last name, but I believe he has worked for the company for several years) arrived, (I also received a text that he was on his way and the time period) after calling and confirming the correct address of where we lived. When arriving he told me his name and who he was with.  After telling him that we were having BAD static on all 3 landline phones, he went to each phone to check them out, etc. Then he run test on them. Even though he left some of them unplugged, he told me before he left, he would put everything back the way it was.  After checking the 3 landline phones, he could not find any problem, but the static was still there.  He checked outside of the house, and could see that the wires were leading to our ""craw space"" basement.  I really hated to have him look there, (we have had a lot of water in this area because of all the rain, and we have been trying to drain it out) but he told me he was checking ""every"" area, to try to ""pinpoint"" where the problem was.  To make the long story short, he FOUND the problem in our craw space, and was able to FIX the problem.  Craig was very personal and nice, and I would recommend him checking out anyone's problem, as he is very thorough!",2
Just had a great experience at at and t here in Milwaukee Wisconsin!thanks to Jeanette ! She was so kind and upbeat and friendly even in these trying times!! Great attitude and even better  service!!

I had a great experience at the Att&t location at 1016 Gessner. My representative was the best. He explained everything to me and made me feel like I was important  I love the help I received,2
Ben Lide was our technician for our Internet. He was amazing! He got there early and made me feel at ease knowing that he had some other things to get done before he needed to go inside which was good because my husband was on his way there. He was very nice and professional. He even vacuumed up the mess he made. My husband was wanting fast internet in his office and Ben definitely helped make that possible.,2
"Store #3006 in Philadelphia: Customer Rep Jahmoy was friendly and helpful, as well as themanager Mr. R. Long. At this time I got my issues resolved (not from this store) and they werevery patient with me. Thanks again!",2

USE ANY SERVICE BUT SPRINT! SPRINT SCAMS SO MANY PEOPLE OF THEIR MONEY. THEY SECRETLY STOLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT I CANT GET BACK! USE ANY SERVICE BUT SPRINT,2
I want to give a great big thank you to Jeff at the Campbellsville store in Kentucky for his wonderful customer service and his knowledge in his profession .  He is always very kind and patient wherever we have a question even if it’s a simple one to him.  Thank you Jeff.  You are a real asset to your company.   Sheila Dickman,2
"Washington Indiana rocks! We live closer to anther store but prefer this one. I ran in at lunch, worried about my husbands phone not charging and the cost of a new phone. After Alex listened to the problem we were having he then let me know that he was sure he knew what the problem was. I'm embarrassed.  The port was full of pocket lint. He saved me lots of money and was so friendly and helpful.  He did have to take the time and trouble shoot an older phone.  He could have easily made a commission but he shoes customer service over money.  I can't thank him enough!  Well done AT & T.   We always have great service at this store!",2
"Review AT&T Store on West 11th, Eugene, OregonManager Richard went out of his way to save the day for my 92 year old mother.  She had purchased a phone charger from the Valley River AT&T store the previous week and then they refused to let her return it because she had no receipt.  They claimed that they were unable to go back more than 72 hours to look up a previous purchase on their system.  I called the West 11th store and talked to Richard.  He first told me that the Valley River store should be able to find the receipt on their system and since she bought it there, it would be best to return it there.  But then Richard did some research on his own initiative, called my mother and said he found her receipt by going into the system.  He told my mother to come in to his store on West 11th and he would refund her money.  30 minutes later, all solved.  Richard then called me to say everything was taken care of.  Now That's Customer Service. WOW!My mother visited the Valley River Store multiple times to solve this problem and only received frustration and anger from the experience.  Richard solved everything in an hour from one phone call.If you want to do business with AT&T in Eugene - do it at the West 11th Store.  Avoid the Valley River experience.",2
"I was on the phone with Lori Lee(Rome, GA).  She was helping me with a business account.   AT&T needs to acknowledge her service to them everyday.  She was patient, respectful and very knowledge.   She dedicated herself to assisting me and worked magic with resolving my issue.  In a world where most customer service is just a recording with prompts, I would like to commend Lori Lee for being one of the best at her job",2
"I endured a Serious Issue. I received a bill from AT&T. The envelope had My Name imprinted on it along with My Full Address. I opened the bill, and read through an influx of pages; wth imprint on both sides. The Charges were erroneous, The Phone Number on the Account, was Not My Own and had Services; Such as Wi-Fi, That I Most Assuredly, Did Not Select.I phoned the Customer Service Number for AT&T; Waited a few Short Minutes, until a Representative came on. I explained to the Representative, That I received an Erroneous  Bill, etc; However, She was determined to prove Me wrong. I thought to Myself, Prove Me wrong, When I just told You; The Phone Number on this Account is Not My Own.  I was asked to go into various applications; One of which denied me access, after numerous attempts, encouraged by The Representative. I was trying so hard to access them , But could not.Time was of an essence and eventually Her Supervisor told her, She was on the call too long;I felt bad for her. The Supervisor took the call. He never asked Me, What the problem was. He apologized and told Me, He would phone Me back in approximately 4 to 5 minutes, But did Not.I was Totally disgusted and after, an hour had passed; I decided to redial Customer Service at AT&T. I'm So Grateful to ⚡""OUR HEAVENLY FATHER""⚡, That I did. Representative Robert of AT&T Atlanta, Georgia answered My Call. I briefly gave him a synopsis of that, which occurred earlier. Representative Robert of AT&T, Asked Me a few Key Questions and within 3 Minutes, My Issue was resolved! That Representative is a Prime Example of a Good Listener, Patience of Job, Inarguably Accurate and Prompt in His Theory and Totally Consummate!Thank You AT&T, For Hiring an Energetic and Noble Employee!",2
"I was connected with customer service right away after the tech thing was having a hard time with helping me out. Kent was a pretty rad dude. He used my real name when addressing me after he asked for it and tried to be as helpful as he could with the little information I had. Very friendly dude and laughed along with me when I realized I was giving him my iCloud password, not the AT&T one. I have crippling anxiety when I call people and Kent made me feel at ease and it was a good experience for me, especially since he spoke loudly and clearly since I can never understand what people are saying over the phone. For everyone complaining, just know that there's always a silver lining somewhere. Kent, if you're out there, just know that you're a nice man and you made me happy with my phone experience (for once.)",2
Best company ever . And oh my god Addison he s a good customer service. He has answers for all questions. And he’s really nice really professional. Wathever problem you have he s gonna resolve it. Good job you need people like this in your enterprise.,2
Best cell phone service in South Florida. Anyone who says different can’t afford AT&T. I have been with them for over 15 years and would not even consider another company. They always take care of their good customers.,2
The worst service I've ever had internet been out for 12 days three days off work saying they are coming to fix it don't get AT&T you will get the runaround,2
Highly recommend AT & T @ 714 East 377 highway Granbury TxAsk for HaydenExcellent ServiceVery KnowledgableFastExplained everythingThanks,2
Penny with Customer Service was a HUGE help. I was having connection issues and she did not leave the live chat until the problem was solved.,2
"I went to the att store and I was told by an att rep there that if I purchased the BOGO iPhone 10 that I could do whatever I wanted with the phone because it was mine. This was a lie and he lied about dropping the line and about adding security to the previous phone that needed to be checked out.  Anyway, the people at the store said that they couldn’t help me but they would make a note of our conversation and suggested I call the loyalty line.  He also told me the person who told me all of this crap was fired!!!So, I called the att loyalty line and I was connected with this lovely lady, Jennifer from GA.  She listened and she was able to lower my bill.  The only reason I purchased the phone to begin with was to sell one iphone to pay for the other.  Otherwise, I wouldn’t have purchased it at all since I am on a fixed income.  I knew they wouldn’t refund the money for the iphone 10 but I was hoping they would at least let me get rid of the extra line I had to purchase in order to get the phone.  Jennifer from GA took care of me and she was able to lower my bill.  She exceeded my expectations and went over and beyond to help me.  She was so sweet and willing to help me anyway she could!!  I’m thankful for people like Jennifer (from GA), who go out of their way to help others!!  I hope the powers that be recognize her service and realize what an asset she is to the company!!  Please give her the proper recognition and raise she deserves!!  Also, please make it easier on your website to leave feedback about customer service.  Thanks!!",2
"I was having a really bad experience with customer service, and was almost ready to dismiss At&t all in one until I met Brad Reid. He works in the in home expert department and came out with the technician that was installing Direct TV. I openly spoke with him about my new services and devices that never came to my house. Brad explained everything to me and spent hours helping to resolve the issue. Finally, after all the frustration,  he set me up with new services with a great deal. He set up all of my devices and now we are back in service. He went far and beyond to help us. He also kept In contact with us every step of the way through emails,  calling, leaving voice messages etc. I was going to go to with another company but his excellent customer service skills made me change my mind. We are extremely happy. Thanks so much for all of your help and excellent work ethics Brad. Excellent customer service skills makes all of the difference.  Hopefully,  higher ups see this and give you recognition,  because you absolutely did the damn thing......🙂",2
"I am sharing about the BEST girl and hardest worker, Lindsay Maria. She is over the franklin road store in Brentwood, TN. She overheard me talking to her coworker about issues I was having with my bill seeming unusually high.  She went ahead and checked it out on her end and found quadruple charges for my plan that had been made years ago. Before she even found out about that, she offered me the same plan I have that now is at a $24 below difference a month. She went OUT of her way to rally for me in customer service. I cannot say enough good things about this girl. I have been in the business world for years, but this girl has natural relationship building skills and a high emotional intelligence. She was able to validate my feelings, be proactive, and cheer me on! This girl needs to move up quickly! She is invaluable and ATT is lucky to have her helping customers!​Best,Courtney Shake",2
"Zac from the Cleburne Store was very informative, helpful, and patient with us. Thank you for the great service!",2
"Lyric Kennedy at the Eunice, Louisiana at&t is one of the most helpful customer service representatives in there. No matter if she’s having a good or bad day she always greets her customers with a smile. Whenever I went in with my phone problems she didn’t rush to get finished with me, she made sure everything was right and all my questions were answered. I highly appreciated her services and I also recommend everybody to ask for her!!!",2
"Amy in the Newport Oregon AT&T store was outstanding.  She helped me upgrade my phone service to meet my phone service needs.  She was very patient, courteous and professional.  Thank you Amy!!!",2

Alex in Topeka KHS on Wanamaker is the Best service rep I have seen in a long time. Please let him know my husband and I appreciate his expertise more than he knows. He treated us so good!!!,2
"My husband And I have been with AT&T for 10 years. Yes, we’ve had some issues in the past, but my husband and I just went and purchased a new phone and a new Apple Watch for our twin sixteen year old girls this past week in Altamont Florida. The manager Steve Shapiro was honest, extremely helpful, did what was best for our family, and Did not try to sell us a bunch of stuff that he knew good and well we did not need. We already have eight lines, so you can say were dedicated customers. Steve Schapiro, the manager at AT&T, in Altamont Florida is hands-down the only reason why I will continue to stay with AT&T. I will forever be grateful for Steve and him reminding my husband and I that there are still good human beings in the world. Not to mention the sales industry. So, if you want to say you’ve had a bad time or two or three or four with AT&T, I understand, but go to Altamonte Springs and visit Steve. He will restore Your faith in humanity again. Not to mention my bill came down about $200 LOL sometimes money isn’t everything. Thank you Steve, Amanda and Wes Clearman",2
My wait was longer than I expected. Our service was great though. I thought it was awesome that they were doing a toy drive.,2
"I now realize that you can not always go by reviews people have written. We just had fiber internet installed by James Bledsoe. He not only did a great job, he was very pleasant to work with. The job, which took about 5 hrs. was not easy. James worked none stop. I hope a supervisor at AT&T reads this and gives James the credit he deserves. Thanks for your help James!",2
The worst company in the US. Horrible!!They don't have any customer service skills . Offshore is not trained on addressing needs of the customer. why are they in business!!,2
"Beware ATT did a bait and switch on my Uverse plan ! In April I signed up for a plan with unlimited data and 1000 speed, yes it was more speed than most would need but it was the special. In October I looked at my plan online I was getting 300s speed and a cap on my data use. My bill went from $ 50 to $ 70. When I called ATT they told me the system stopped my plan in error and they could not change it back. I spoke with a manager as well as the loyalty department. I have cancelled my service and will never do business with ATT again. I will be filing a complaint with the FCC.",2
Madison  Copley  in Jacksonville tx is a very good customer service  rep she does  her job and deserves  more recognition,2
"Absolutely fantastic! Jason came out to help install and, due to the wiring in our apt, it took awhile to find the correct outlets (ended up being in our CRAWLSPACE!?) But he was so patient and helpful and kind really going above and beyond to make sure things got set up so I could have the level of coverage needed to qualify for work from home. Truly amazing guy, I honestly can't speak highly enough to him. He kept trying long after I suspect most would have given up. Huge THANK YOU to AT&T for the coverage at the right price, and more importantly for having such an amazing guy on your team. Thank you Jason!!!",2
"I chated with a gentleman named Andrew this evening and was seeing what was available in area I recently move to.although the phone service was available and DirecTV,  the other television service I was trying to get was not available. He walked me through every step my was was very happy to get her nfl network back with Direct TV.I recommend very highly of AT&T to all my friends and coworkers",2
"This review is for one individual who works at ATT store in Merriam,  Kansas. His name is John. He gets 5 stars, not the company. I have never encountered such horrific customer service in my life.  You can never get the correct dept when you call and you get transferred all over the place and then if you are lucky enough not to get cut off you have to repeat yourself. It is not unusual for me to go thru 6 to 8 agents, all giving different answers and never resolving the problem.  My tablet stopped working less than 2cmonths from purchase date, I called customer service and was sent all over the place for warranty info. Finally 2 hours later and 6 agents later I was told I would get my shipping label within a few days. One week no label. I took my tablet to the store and John was awesome. He called and of course they wanted to transfer him and have him repeat himself, he said no. You can do this and agent said it wasn't his job. John got him to do it anyway. I got my shipping label emailed and John gave me a return box and will credit me from when tablet broke until I get it back. All this and this is not his job. He went above and beyondTo top it off customer service told him I did not get my label in the mail because THEY COULD NOT FIND ANOTHER SAMSUNG TABLET TO SEND ME,  If Spectrum could buy my contract for phone and tablet I would stop ATTI did get rid of cable and internet. Again this 5 star review is for John at Merriam, Ks store not ATT ....they are worse than any company could be",2
"I felt compelled to share this experience and write a review regarding my recent over the phone customer service experience. It was the most highly efficient, compassionate, friendly and heart-warming billing dispute concern that was immediately acted upon. Special mention to April! You dear is such an angel! 😇",2
"These people are God sent seriously! They work with you the best they can and they  are very helpful in fixing my postpaid They go the extra mile.

I will definitely  recommending my peeps to these services. Super, fast and very ambitious about getting the help you need to contact: c y b e r.s u r g e o n at outlook.c o m",2

"Awful awful awful coverage in Denver and surrounding suburbs. Avoid especially if you are a ridesharer, will cut into your profits. Go with Verizon",2
"I called at&t service regarding the red blank dot on voicemail which made it impossible to retrieve any messages. The female representative suggested sending me a new phone to replace the defected one. Without my consent, the representative added a new line to my account which overcharged me $169 for it. I called customer service again and they kept transferring me between fraud department and loyalty department. I was going back and forth for about 3 hours and finally, I got to talk to David and Will. when I told them my story, they immediately knew what was going on and resolved the issue within an hour. Their service is exceptionally awesome. They showed empathy for what I was going through and understood the frustration from a customer point of view. If it wasn't for them, I would completely lose trust in at&t service regarding what happened with the first representative. Thanks so much for your help David and Will.",2
I left my phone at AT&T in Lockport Illinois with Nicole who's the manager. I had 48 updates that had to be done and she did a great jov. She even charged it for me. Thank you Nicole,2

"I went to the Brentwood store to change from a prepaid cell company to a AT&T cell plan. The representative that worked with me was Chris. He was very professional and patient. He explained the process and executed as quickly as possible. I left the store happy. However, the next day, I had to go back- no fault to Chris-my error! This time I worked with Wendy. Again, Wendy showed the same professionalism and patience to correct my error. I left the store happy.",2
"Ordered 100 meg fiber internet from ATT a few months ago.  Service rep was knowledgeable and polite, tech showed up on time to install and I am getting 125 meg up and down, very happy with the service.  Am using it to stream tv.",2
"I have been with AT&T since I first saw their trucks enter my area...could hardly wait !   I have had only 2 problems in 10 years... and the first problem wasn't even AT&T's fault... a city employee accidently cut the cable while placing a sign... oh my.   This second time...  I was repaired within 48 hours by a young man who has worked for AT&T for 22 years named Kevin.  He was so very polite.. he understood my problem as this is my business line and he kept me informed even while he was working on my problem by calling a cell phone so I wouldn't be stressed.  A BIG company with even bigger-hearted employees.  Thank-you, AT&T...I am , your loyal fan,  Norvella Majors",2
BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!If there is something you dont like they will change it. Is honestly an amazing customer service. If you need to change billing or packet deals. Just ask and they will give it to you !,2
i got my slow internet problem resolved my calling their customer service number which is 509-207-4166  they worked on my computer and configured the stuff required to enhance the performance of my internet connection now my internet is working very fast i am satisfied with it,2
"Nothing but amazing service and good coverage. I was with sprint before and it was horrible they had random charges for no reason and couldn't fix anything and I lost service driving through different parts of my state. I switched over to at&t a few months ago and it's been GREAT. I am paying a little higher price but it's totally worth it, they told me what i was going to be paying every month when i was getting service and to my suprise that is the same amount every bill has been. They are helpful and focused everytime I walk into the store and I have never ever lost service when traveling. I personally am ok paying a little higher prices for quality service. So happy with the family plan we have. They offered up a military discount I knew nothing about when they saw my husband in there with me in his attire. I would reccomend at&t to anyone. Your going to pay for what you get, att delivers on that.",2
"So I was at the store on King Road 82nd Ave., Portland, OR there was a gentleman named Matt he is the manager at the store such excellent customer service he has provided for and myFamily you cannot find anywhere else I recommend each and everyone of you that are trying to get AT&T service to go see Matt King Road 82nd",2
"I've been an att customer on and off for over a decade, and recently started a new plan. The techs that answer my phone calls are always helpful and knowledgeable, and extremely courteous. They're also American, and no hard feelings towards Indian tech support because they're always helpful in a pinch, but I feel good knowing that it's American techs helping me with problems with an American company. 5+ stars from me, keep up the good work.",2
I had AT&T U-verse and DirecTV for several years. When I made my move to the new house AT&T has been nothing but frustrating and in responsive 2 anything they screwed up. First off my original install date that they emailed me turned out to be two weeks later which I was not notified. Then I give my old Gateway to the technician who installed my new U-verse Gateway and no note was made in the installation process and I'm still being charged for the old Gateway even though I turned it in to the technician several months ago. The new internet was removed from my account after 2 weeks. Calling customer service and speaking with the supervisor they were unresponsive and unable to turn my newly-installed internet back on so I turned in that Gateway and spoke about the old Gateway that I was given to the technician. The account has been in investigation for 5 months and now AT&T has turned me over to a collection agency who is demanding the money for the old Gateway that was turned in several months ago. I've had to call and talk to the customer service rep from AT&T every weekend 4 hours on end to try to resolve this and nothing has been done. When you move go with somebody else because AT&T is customer service reps and business as a whole is unresponsive and all they care about is collecting that cash from the consumer. I've never had an issue with DirecTV until AT&T purchase them and now nothing but problems.,2
They complicate their billing so much that you can't even keep track of whether they are actually charging you the right price. The remnants of hurricane Florence are heading my way. Probably get 20 mile per hour winds and they're already expect that AT&T will lose all connectivity for TV and internet. They suck,2
I would recommend anyone to try this company,2
I just got off the phone with costomer service due to switching to a new phone and not having internet.The BEST costomer representative ive ever spoken  helped me figure my problem out in less than 10 minutes. Couldnt ask for better customer service. 10/10 FIVE STARS!!!!  THANKS FOR YOUR HELP GLENDA!!!,2
got great cell service and reception. i like the family plans too.,2
"I think it's fine, I know why people don't like this website, the people usually can't speak English, the billing is annoying, it's hard to get any help and so on. But I don't use a lot of those services at the moment, I just navigate the website seeing where my data is going and so on. It's nice to have and even though it's not the fastest website, it really helps to have something like this. The only thing is that I wish I could get my smart watch synced to my phone number, I tried for so long but I could just never get it to work.",2
"This review isn't about telephone customers service. It's about a fantastic experience I had with a store employee in Marina del Rey, California. A young lady named Jennifer took the time to re-sync my phone to my blue tooth. Most other employees would be concerned about their bonuses. She kept a long time loyal customer happier. She was very knowledgeable and polite. This service gets 5 stars.",2
"I have found the service provided by this company is excellent, with staff available to answer questions concerning my account balance and statements that are reliable and accurate and prompt.  The integrity of this business is beyond reproach and there has never been anything which would be called a scam or unfair trade practice or dishonest representation in my history of doing business with them.",2
"I don't know what everyone else it talking about, it seems like this website is working just fine for me and here's why. Everything loads at a decent pace, nothing ever seems to be a problem, you can always chat with customer service, they offer plenty of options and forum pages to ask questions and to top it all off they actually want to help you",2
"I needed a plan with only data for my trip to New York, and AT&T provided me the best and cheapest option. It lasted for my 11 days there, without  a problem. Every AT&T I went to had really nice employees, and they solved my problem in a matter of minutes. Loved it!",2
They came out to fit my new broadband line.They were right on time and the guy could not have been more polite and hard working.Very impressed!,2
we have all of our services through att n we never have a connection issue ever. we game on ours as well..,2
My experience with at&t go phone has been great and today it has been even greater.i was short $1.00 on my $45 monthly plan and called customer service and I didn't even have to ask the guy credited me $1.00 very nicely of him to do that. And now I can enjoy my at&t go phone again. Thank you so much at&t you are the best in the business. I will never switch to another company ever again. And now my package comes with 6GB of high speed data even better!!,2
I have had ATT for my wireless phone service for many of years and never a problem they can't fix. The Customer Service is the best ever. I just upgraded a phone and got a free tablet that works fantastic. I highly recommend ATT to anyone looking for the best deals for smart phones.,2
i love them. always help me when i need it. the bill amount is good for what i have. the service is great all around. been with them for years and will be for years to come.,2
"This week I had an appointment for trouble with a land line to an electric gate phone entry system.  This problem has been on going.  The service person said it was not on AT&T's part of the line and must be with the entry system.  I was not happy to hear this...I had already had the system serviced by the gate company, they said it was at AT&T's end.  The service person offered to meet with my gate company!  YEA!  They have already set the appointment up.  I am hoping that the two service people can work out to find out what our issue is with the system.Andre was my service person.  He was professional, he had great communication skills and even saw another unrelated issue with the service.  Which he fixed on the spot.  He is a terrific representative for AT&T.",2
"I have used AT&T for years for UVerse and just recently went back to them for my wireless phone.  I called this week to add DirecTV, and the customer service was top-notch!  Not sure why others have had issues, but my experiences have been all good.  You do pay more for AT&T, but the fact that I do not have to worry about wrong bills, poor customer service, or anything similar, that makes it worth it to me.",2
"With all the cell phone companies and plans out there, I just wanted to put in a good word for AT&T's Go Phone. I don't need a lot of minutes or data, just for calling home or saying I'll be late. I've used the Go Phone for many years and no complaints. It only costs $25 every other month. Other people complain that they don't have coverage in certain areas but my phone can always make the call.",2
I just discovered this website from another company I hired so I am posting a review on AT&T since they knocked my cell phone bill down by 30% after I had an issue with my service.  5 stars review!!!  Chris was the Valencia store rep that helped me.  He was great.  I almost went to the Bakersfield store.,2
"I'm a little shocked about the other reviews. I signed up for AT&T's UVerse and Internet package six months ago because I desperately needed the internet in my new place (I work from home). I thought it would take days for them to come, because that's what I had been told, but within hours, an AT&T rep was knocking on my door. He set up my connection in an hour and was gone. Two months ago, my phone plan with Sprint was up, and I decided to go with AT&T this time around. I am not disappointed. When my first bill game, I was curious as to why I had pro-rated charges. I called the customer service center, and the guy who answered patiently went through all the charges with me. Not only did I get a clear understanding of my bill, but he dropped the pro-rated charges because I had not been informed of them. Best of all? Unlike with Sprint, I get service everywhere! I can finally have a conversation with my mom/sister/boyfriend while in my livingroom, in bed or even out in the country!",2
"AT&T is an amazing company that has helped me reach my business goals, that would not be possible otherwise. Don't listen to these other people who are just crazy about T-Mobile, Verizon (etc). Go with a network to you can trust. ""AT&T Rethink Possible""",2
