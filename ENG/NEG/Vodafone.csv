I've had scam calls and Vodafone won't reimburse me as I've been charged. Was given the gigacube for wifi and it was the worst thing I've ever encountered they sent out broadband and then cancelled it.. The signal is absolutely horrendous they don't do anything to help loyal customers the call centre staff are unhelpful and just don't care the worst phone company ever!,0
"Vodafone mobile network reception very poor. Same like Lebara/ Vodafone /Talk mobile all are same company different names. N1C 4PF and E11 3LJ both are internet very poor. 20 years ago was same reception in my area, now 2024 still same. You can't search or watch any streaming in indoor.I'll say avoid Talk mobile and Vodafone until they improve network coverage.Thanks",0
Very revealing that all the good reviews are to do with Sales. The only thing that Vodafone truly does well. Watch for creeping bills. They have a nack for raising bills surreptitiously. Run by over-privileged cotton-wool mouthed toffs with no real world experience. Takes.,0
"We went to Vodafone for our WiFi in October 2024 and, to this day, it has not worked even once. They replaced our router, it did nothing. We've on the phone to them multiple times, even been on multiple video calls, and nothing has been resolved.After months of paying for no service and being asked to do the most basic trouble shooting over and over again, we decided to try and terminate our contract. Apparently, we still have to play termination fees, because it seems months of no service and condescending customer service does not qualify us for the right to leave. Also worth noting, the customer representative said there was no notes on our account saying we were even having trouble after multiple calls with them.Don't waste your time on their broadband packages.",0
I have 3 contracts with Vodafone and have been a loyal customer for over 20yrs.But I'm getting to the point where I will likely move them all because I have now been without mobile data for 4 daysLast thing I received was a message saying I don't need to do anything it's being looked at... since then absolutely nothing!,0
"I would give zero if I could. My home broadband is supposed to be switching to Vodafone today buy yesterday at 16:51 I received an SMS and email from Vodafone informing me that Vodafone have cancelled my new Home Broadband order without an explanation. I spent the next three and a half hours speaking to different Vodafone agents and also with my preset provider to try and stop being disconnected but achieved nothing. The only solution Vodafonre offered is to start a new contract and a manager will call me within 24hours. If no emergency action is taken today and as soon as possible, I will be with no broadband or phone line for the next two weeks. This will be a disaster as I am heavily dependent on my broadband.",0
"Had an awful experience with Vodafone customer services. If you eventually get to speak to a person instead of a robot you cannot understand a word of English they are trying to speak. Mainly they are rude, with the exception of a few and despite me trying to relay a problem with my broadband over 7 separate phone calls, nothing was ever communicated to Openreach. Needless to say I cancelled my account and want nothing more to do with Vodafone EVER!  Think twice before being enticed by their cheap deals because it will end up costing you your sanity.",0
"6 weeks and still waiting on broadband installation. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Terrible, disjointed service. Gave me a complaint ref then closed the complaint without speaking to me, I still have no service and am told simply to wait",0
An absolute disgrace.  I have been charged a late payment fee that they refuse to refund after I was sent what appeared to be a fraudulent text.Vodafone confirmed it was not them and so I cancelled my direct debit and set up again just in case.Vodafone now say it was them and they apologised for their mistake but the refuse to refund.I’m also told I cannot complain because their Ask Once service is only in a trial phase and so there is nothing they can do.As always a dreadful experience with a company who cares about one thing and it isn’t customers.,0
"I put extras on my account, but they were really difficult to remove. I spoke to some one, who - basically- tricked me into not cancelling there and then and sayin if I waited until a certain date I could have the charges removed that month. Not true. IF you get through to them on the phone, don't let them trick you into not making the changes you want right there and then. I have finbally got the charges removed, but have ened up paying for a nother three months. They seem to think that is OK. Wish I could leave them. AWFUL SERVICE,.",0
Don’t touch Vodafone with a barge poll. My so called contract went from £40 to over £150/month - pure daylight robbery! This is nearly surpassed by the sheer incompetence and appalling customer service - which has to be done over Twitter of all things! And after paying extra to terminate my contract before it skyrockets - I can’t get anyone at Vodafone to confirm that my final invoice/payment is actually my last. Seriously stick to SIM only people - these companies can’t be trusted.,0
"Had Vodafone broadband, and organised to have connection moved to new property a month in advance (allowed by the contract). They said no engineer would be needed and would be up and running on day of moving in with same router.Moved in to new house, connected router, and nothing. Contacted Vodafone, and after an hour it transpired they had accidentally closed my account. It would take 2 weeks before internet could be restored, and it took 2 hours to reinstate a new account.Awful service, and the second big screw up I've experienced with Vodafone.",0
"Be weary about extending your contract with Vodaphone! It can destroy your credit score.I was an existing customer and when my deal came to an end I applied for credit for a new phone and SIM plan. Which was actually cheaper then my current deal.Vodaphone's credit team applied 2 hard searches to credit file, which has completely destroyed my credit score. This is even more frustrating after having a pristine credit file for a considerable amount of time.I have lost hours of time now writing to the Ombudsman and FCA to try and get this corrected.It is appalling and seriously wouldn't bother taking the risk.",0
"Revolting customer service over the whole year since I entered the contract.  First they put me on on their legacy systems, then they  could not resolve roaming charges, even though i had these charges included in my contract, and now they simple closed my complaint.  I am shocked. Totally incompetent, unpleasant, extremely poor service.MY EDIT:  The reply form Vodafone is equally unacceptable.  I called them and emailed them enough.  Where is the telephone number to a competent person??",0
"I went from moneysupermarket for a Vodafone deal, at the checkout stage am told my personal details are wrong but it doesn't specify what. I try a couple of times, delete cookies etc, but no change. The bot chat is slow, and an adviser appears but disappears mid chat. I try again, nothing. I call, first time it's picked up but no voice. Second time, I'm put through to X, Y, then Z in sales, who says she can't help process the deal I want as it's online only. This has alll taken most of an hour. Absolute waste of time, and it's exactly the kind of crap I got at EE hence I left.",0
"AVOID VODAFONE!They owe me over £320 compensation due to being unable to connect my broadband on my activation date. BUT.... it's not the money that matters, when people lie to you, it means you don't matter. Choose a better provider.",0
"Simply horrible.Signal wasn’t very good, the data hardly ever worked.We eventually left and joined EE, my contract was over. However about 2 months later I got a letter from a debt collection saying I owed Vodafone £30 something. When I contacted the debt collection agency they had no idea why I hadn’t been notified and sent it back to Vodafone. Vodafone didn’t apologise or explain why they never told me I owed them money. I paid it since it was £30But my partner (who also left Vodafone) was told he owed them £210 for the remaining contract balance and phone. So he paid that, but then 3 months later, he has received a letter from a debt collection agency saying he owes £510! Where on earth did this number come from? He contacted the debt collection agency and they sent it back to Vodafone. He has emailed Vodafone wanting an explanation and has not yet received one.We even got a letter saying that his account was settled with the £210 payment. What an absolute joke. Would not recommend",0
My iPhone broke before Xmas- it is covered by Vodafone for repair or replacement.The people in the store were pleasant but really poor at communicating what information was required to be able to send the phone off- I had to go back twice and my husband once. Information given was completely contradictory and caused a significant waste of my time.,0
"My wife upgraded from ""pay as you go"" to ""pay as you go plus"" as Vodafone kept urging her to do so.After a week and a half of total frustration, being messed about, not being able to use the app to log on (the sole means of access), spending endless time on the phone to get it sorted out, she gave up and told Vodafone to just cancel it. She's now gone back to basic ""pay as you go"" with her old number.A week an a half totally wasted!",0
LIERS!They admitted on the phone that they lied to me multiple times. Were they bored? Were they incompetent? I do not know that. They did nothing to help me afterwards. Had to spend 5hours on the phone with them to sort the easiest of issues.I have never had such bad experience with any kind of service!,0
"The worst experience I’ve had. As a first time for trying to get a phone contract to build my credit score as a young person. It took them 8 weeks and over 5 in store visits. Multiple credit checks were run and effected my score. At to top it off I wasn’t even able to purchase a phone. I am utterly gobsmacked at the service and how they let this happen to multiple people due to system errors on their end that leave customers without a phone and an affected credit score. I use my phone for work and missed multiple events were it was needed as they couldn’t resolve their issue. Would not recommend, the entire infrastructure at Vodafone is useless and they couldn’t seem more uninterested in helping you",0
"Twice recently I’ve tried to upgraded and both times I’ve been on the phone what seems like forever and never got even a price because they don’t know there stuff, good god how are they still in business, EE here I come after 20 years of being loyal",0
I ordered a broadband package from this company and made appointment to deliver the equipment 4 times but did not arrive.  Eventually after numerous phone calls it did and when I complained their response was it arrived on date of switch over.I wasted 4 days and no one cared will never buy from this company again,0
"Had broadband since 2020 and it's got steadily worse since. The past few months have been unbearable. I work from home and can't do half of what I need to do due to poor speeds and an unstable connection. I have spent several hours on the phone to Vodafone over the past couple of months, and on 22/12/24 I was told I could leave if the issue wasn't rectified within 30 days.On this time, I have made several calls to customer support who have offered contradictory advice on every call with no improvement. I have also had a visit from Openreach, that did absolutely nothing. Today I was given yet another 24 hours to wait before being given a call back to find out that the issue has yet to improve. I was told today that if I cancel, I would be liable for the early termination fee even though I am already paying for an unusable service.Shocking network, shocking service. Absolutely avoid. Thankfully, the staff have been pleasant so that's the only plus point.Update 20/01/25Vodafone still have no record of the email they have sent, which I have helpfully tweeted at them after spending several more hours on the phone, being passed from home broadband team to cancellations, and back again. They are still insistent that the cancellation fees apply, even though we are now at 30 days since I received the early termination email. Shocking customer service yet again.",0
Staff not remotely helpful online or phone based.Been with Vodaphone for 16 years every time i contact them its a new challenge to actually speak to anyone who can help with my queries. The MOST unhelpful company i have ever dealt with Glad iv now cancelled my contract and moved to EE. Vodaphone is no longer what it used to be at all!,0
"Whilst I would say Vodafone are the best broadband provider for problem-less internet, I upgraded to the 250 minimum megaband limit but broadband tests never go higher than in the 90s which for me is Vodafone not agreeing to their terms. So don't upgrade!EDIT Vodafone say ring them up but i tried that. Been through all that!",0
"I bought a smart bike tracker GPS from them for £65. They have now discontinued the service, so I possibly have the most expensive bike light—thanks to Vodafone. = Regret.",0
"Poor customer service, e mails ignored and an impossible web site to follow. Bounced from dept to dept on the phone, after two hours gave up. After 30 years I'm going to a provider who values customers.",0
"Anyone who uses Vodafone knows most of these reviews are fake. Using the Wayback Machine you can see the volume of reviews on here jumped hugely from May 2023 to June 2023 and mysteriously the rating went from being 1.3 to 4. What a turnaround in just a month, it's almost like they used an LLM to generate plausable sounding reviews.The old score was reflective of the service they provide.",0
"Dreadful. I was sold a 150MB service that is slower than Plusnet standard. The router drops out all of the time, if you switch channels on the TV you are playing russian roulette with actually getting anything back. Just spent about half an hour on line with the service adviser, another waste of time.Of course to cancel they want a fee even though I am paying for a service that they said they could provide but do not appear to do so. They have drilled a load of holes in my house to fit equipment that does not work. It is that bad that I am going to pay the cancellation fee and go back to Plusnet, I should bill these clowns for the damage they have done to my property and bank balance. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Disconnected my number without warning, when I went to a branch for support, they were not interested in helping. Other networks are better.",0
"From the bottom of my heart I urge you to NOT pick Vodafone.  My WiFi was supposed to be installed in July 2024, we ordered the router and waited for somebody to come and install it, month after month it got pushed back, nobody would help us and we went 4 months without our WiFi being installed.  In November somebody finally came to install it; now you’d think that would be sorted - think again. Because I had not paid for the 4 months that we HADNT even used, they cut off our WiFi and said the only way to fix the issue was to pay for the full 6 months and they could refund us afterwards. Come to today, I have paid the full amount of 6 months, and they tell me that we no longer have a contract and I have to order a new router, but I CANNOT change my broadband to another company because “we have a contract with Vodafone”.  I have never had such an incredibly abysmal experience with a company in my whole life.  I have wasted 6 months of my life calling Vodafone for answers and every single time I’m on the phone for 3+ hours and have NO happy outcome. £130 down and STILL NO WIFI.  If I could go back in time I would have picked Gigaclear.",0
My broadband content control doesn't work and after 2 weeks of trying they still couldn't fix it which exposed my kids to adult content. Despite not being able to fix it they refuse to cancel my contract so I can move to other provider.,0
Customer service is probably the most expensive mini company I’ve been with over 20 years. I certainly would use them again very disappointed.,0
"We joined to Vodafone on 18th December and after New year we had  the problems and on 7th January it stopped working at all. Support service doesn't work. Everyday we are waiting update and they only change the date and nothing happens one week ago. Both me and my son are working remotely, but vodafone doesn't care. We are still waiting for any internet and asked the refund, will cancel this service once we get internet back...",0
"The misery continues. Day 6, still no internet. Vodafone first blamed Openreach, insisting they used the wrong type of Ethernet cable from the Openreach box to the router! Openreach had to revisit the property to prove there was nothing wrong with the Openreach box or the cable. They now think it’s a faulty router. Three more days pass. New router arrived today and yep, exactly the same, still flashing red! Openreach box looks fine, all green.",0
Just recently moved to vodafone for broadband. Agreed deal and price. But two.larger amounts now taken from account.  Not received  a welcome pack as promised. So no PIN number. I cannot get through to anyone without pin. Crazy. Tried two full days on chat. I can't answer security questions because none set up. Total waste of time. Day 3 still not  got anywhere.  They say they will send code to.my mobile. None comes. They probably got that wrong as well. Big mistake changing to them. Customer service doesn't  exist.,0
Vodafone are a complete shambles the logistics of ordering a broadband line has and still is a nightmareI thought Openreach were bad but Vodafone have surpassed them for incompetence,0
"If I could give less than 1 I would believe me! This network are financial bullies. I currently have a open financial abuse case against Vodafone. They have made up 6 different direct debits for one contract phone. Charging me almost £250 per month. So I stopped paying all 6 and just paid my monthly bill via the app. Now I'm getting letters threatening me with Debt collectors and they have sent the same ""owed"" balance to 2 separate collection agencies. To which I have paid one when I have been informed by my solicitor I don't have to pay any other than the one stated in my Billing section of my app as that is the only legally binding payment I need to make to cover my mobile contract bill. The amount of letters, emails and calls I get daily, would push even the strongest to become suicidal imo. Steer well clear of their new contract payment design as they dint inform you at the start that you'll have 2-6 separate DD..",0
"My line was cut of even tho my contract is still on going when I contacted customer service they said something about some other provider did it but the thing is I didn't go to any other provider (i think they are just BSing to save there skin) and when I explained everything they just say ""oh, ok we will place a new order and it will probably fix it"" and the order gets cancelled. This happened 4 times and no solution still its almost been 2 moths and don't have the service I paid for. I have to say dog Shit service with no real solution they could have just removed the other providers line and put in ours",0
"Broadband stopped working. No idea why and no-one from Vodafone had any idea as to initial cause. Interminable phone calls trying to get it sorted spanning a week. Issued me an 8 digit fault reference code. Phone system would only accept a 6 digit code, so had huge menus to plough through wasting time every call. Promised a call back which didn't happen. Poor. Wish we'd never left Virgin.Should also mention that we had to bin our previously reliable TP link mains adaptors when we signed on as we couldn't get them to work with the Vodafone router. Google research confirms we are by far the only people to have the same issue.",0
"After Vodafone messing up my broadband  install and leaving me with no internet, they got act together and fixed that, now 2 months down the line I find they are charging me for a mobile hotspot( that they sent I didn't want) and were going to carry on that 57.48 mth charge and the help desk idiots could not see the maths in the bill claiming the bill was correct.I've raised a formal complaint and will update asapPs the previous specialist care email I had previously referred 6 digit no doesn't workUpdate 16/1/25 after registering a complaint and spending hours on phone to the helpdesk and me demanding a supervisor contact me, a manager phoned last night to agree with my figures for the costs and has said he will refund me, but nothing else for my hassle.",0
"Update of my 28 Dec Review. Although i have proved my broadband is 27MB/s slower than the guaranteed minimum speed, my proof is not enough (ex BB engineer). They have basically said, that's it, it's your kit, live with it. They are mis-selling their packages, I believe they are over subscribed and their core cannot cope. I am searching for another provider. Choose another provider.",0
was with vodafone  for 6 days because they would not correct my last name they messed up they were only  wanting a 4 digit  security code from me  witch I could not remember .they did dot have the brains to check my form that I signed up with or my bank details  also my email address witch they had .so as I said only 6 days I had there router  and I took it to a vodafone shop in Aberdeen bon a cord centre .now I just got my bank statement with £28.oo taken out  by vodafone I returned there item with in the 14 day .rip off artists.,0
"Been with Vodafone for 4 years, never missed a payment, have Experian credit rating of 928 out of 999 but Vodafone failed my credit check for an upgrade and won’t give an explanation.I went to EE and they passed me straight away.Bye bye Vodafone 😊",0
After being with Vodafone for many years with more downs than ups and pricing does not reflect in fair customer service or what they offer with contract! Being on a 5G contract and working in a local city that they say 5G is an area they provide is false and misleading. You rarely get it yet pay for it. I don't live out in a remote area yet for the last year since moving I can never get a signal for 4G and network coverage is just awful for phone calls and have to rely on WiFi calling. So again why am I paying for an unusable service. You will get the general BS from customer service about this but ultimately doesn't solve anything so contract should not be legally binding. But I'm sure like many 1 stars on here which I find more true than the promoted 5 stars (think trust pilot needs to look into them 5 star reviews) you will just get poor service from this company. I have thankfully finished my contract to move to a cost and........ (yes I actually now have 4G at home and 5G works where it should) Giff Gaff are the way forward with more flexibility and great cheaper upgrades than most leading mobile providers!!! Take a hint and move on,0
"Vodafone are unprofessional, make fake promises and do not fulfill their final outcomes of complaint procedureI had a default on my credit file through no fault of my own, I was promised this would be removed back in December 2023 still is showing on my credit file and I have email confirmation that it was supposed to have been removedEvery time you ask for a manager call back or documents they don’t send relevant details or return your call!I HAVE PASSED THIS OVER TO THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN",0
"Hopeless. Installation of new broadband was supposed to happen 4 weeks ago but didn’t because it required 2 engineers to do the work. No contact from installation team since then, just pointless and time wasting phone calls every few days from a different department asking whether I’ve had an update. When I complained, my case was escalated, but still no action.Please don’t reply to this review with links to Facebook or  Twitter as I don’t do social media and I’m not chatting to a  chat bot either.  I just want a human being to contact me by phone or email with a date for when this installation will take place.Regarding reply from Vodafone below - As stated I don’t do social media 🙄. Generic computer generated response to all negative reviews I guess. Ho hum, back to SKY I Suppose",0
They customer service is ILLEGAL. I called them three times today and the results are:* Hanging up on me* Giving me wrong advice* Telling me my parcel is dispatched with DPD while DPD knows nothing about it.Thank you Vodafone fot being so RELIABLE!,0
"Got a fibre network with an advertised speed 400+ Mbps. That speed is hardly ever reached, but this isn't an issue. The issue is reliability of the service. The Internet drops off randomly during the day. Sometimes speed is 2 Mbps when sitting 30 cm away from the router. Being on the call you regularly get ""poor network quality"" message. Lately even watching online tv becomes jagged.",0
I've been a customer for long first 6 months. I had a good experience then became the worst customer service.I’m Waiting to end up contract this year. Then bye-bye to Vodafone forever. Customer service can’t say it’s worse ( Not experienced telephone advisor at all),0
"I think Vodafone is the most awful company I have ever felt with. I can’t even express how much pain and stress this company has caused me. How they treat their customers is vile. I have been trying to leave Vodafone for a month. I know I won’t be the only person having this trouble! I have spent hours on the phone to them getting me nowhere. Sending me around and around in circles. I’m on the app, following their directions finally to ‘switch to another network’ and that option is nowhere to be seen on my app. My whole family has had problems with them. Whatever you do DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! They will keep adding charges to your bill, they don’t listen to you, they pass your around to 100 different people on the phone and leave you feeling sick for the rest of the day and quite literally not let you leave the company. I thinks it’s absolutely disgusting how they have treated me and don’t want this to happen to someone else.",0
"I had a balance on my account which I requested to be credited into my bank account 5 weeks ago. I got back to them 4 times so far, and they finally credited a small amount of my balance. I am wondering how long it`s gonna take and how many times I have to get in touch with them until I get the total amount back. They treat customers as fools",0
"Vodafone internet broadband service is very unreliable. The service experiences network issues daily, at random times. Each event lasts ~3 min. This isn't enough time for the broadband service to ""catch"" the issue, and so they ignore it, saying that if they cannot spot it, they cannot report it. Previous recommendation I got from Vodafone under last negative review, was to contact the social media team. I did it today and they said it was a misunderstanding as they do not deal with such issues. Therefore, it's not only that the service is unreliable, and the technical help is bad, but also their own recommendations are misleading. It seems impossible to get connected with a competent member of their staff to have an issue addressed.",0
"Tried to join on the web, page said a problem so I called, firstly the Indian woman didn’t understand and I got cut off! She rang back so fair play, not understood again so passed me through to the new team! John who sounds like he’s eaten half of Newark was much help as a chocolate fire guard!! Went to get a manager. I got cut off again!! No call back.  The funny thing is I’ve not even joined yet and they are useless and secondly I was a magnet there and left cause they were crap. No improvement and I think I’ll join sky or virgin",0
"Last May, I intended to cancel my contract as I was leaving the UK to travel overseas. However, when I called to cancel, I was offered an alternative plan and assured that it would work globally.Initially, this seemed like a great deal. However, I later discovered that the plan has a restriction: after 90 days outside the UK, you can only use the data globally if you’ve spent more time in the UK than abroad. This was never explained to me at the time of purchase.This condition makes the plan completely unsuitable for me, as my sole reason for agreeing to it was to maintain my regular services while traveling. Now, I’m stuck paying £42 a month for a plan I cannot use, in addition to purchasing local SIM cards.I am deeply disappointed with the service I’ve received from Vodafone. After 15 years as a loyal customer, I will be canceling my contract as soon as it ends and will not be returning.If the plan could not be used overseas as a regular contract, it should never have been sold to me, and I should have been allowed to cancel my original contract without pressure or misrepresentation.",0
"Terrible ServiceIt took 2 months to connect and switch on the service, we did receive compensation but that came from BT not vodaphone.Since then I get 40mb at the TV and approx 130mb at our laptops if the 500mb were paying for and apparently it's NOT vodaphone that the problem it's all our equipment HaThey don't listen and haven't made any attempt to rectify the issue.After being fobbed off I looked at Sky and gave now received an email telling me I owe the £380 if I leave early. What a joke.Thanks further quick response but my review is based on my experience AFTER I've spoken with the technical team.",0
Left EE to go on a sim only plan which took 4 months and about 35hrs (yes no kidding) to get this sim connected after sending me 3 faulty sims out. I still paid for the 4 months I was waiting for sim to be connected.This company is better kept away from.,0
It has been a month which I have been trying to upgrade two mobile phones contract but no luck as Vodafone has an internal error that can’t be sorted in 30 days. Inconvenience it caused immense. Not even a star they deserve after these many years having three mobile contracts and broadband. I will be taking my business elsewhere.,0
"Shocking company! My sister has just rung them up to cancel our very ill mum's mobile phone contract (that she hasn't used for over a year) after losing my dad. We hoped that they may show some goodwill and refund some of her monthly amount invoices...........not a chance!! They cancelled her contract and offered nothing. Terrible, unsympathetic customer service.",0
"We have switched to Vodaphone Superfast Fibre. For some reason (CGNAT, IPv6 tunnelling and similar), this is blocked by Vodafone. The consequence is that we remotely cannot operate important apps remotely. The consequences are serious. Nobody seems to be able to help with this and Vodaphone are unresponsive. Not at all happy, should have stayed on copper wires with another provider. We now have to switch away. Wake up Vodaphone, get shot of those darn chatbots of yours and start sorting these issues. My advice to anyone is don't switch to Vodaphone as you'll waste your life being their beta testers.",0
"Absolutely awful, can’t get to speak to anyone that that awful txt service where they promise to do things and don’tThey said my direct debit was sorted and wasn’t. Diabolical I’ll be going elsewhere soon as this contract is done",0

"Appallingly incompetent customer service.  Have a business account plus opened a personal account, and was too difficult -- over 45mins on the phone...! -- to port a number within their own network.  For a while they tried to claim they couldn't even see the business number.  Then, after being transferred between at least 3-4 different people, the call disconnected.",0
"I've been with vodafone close to 20 years, For the past few years I've been paying for device plans and air plans for 3 people under my name. I tried to upgrade one of them at  the weekend but was denied after checking my credit profile.Even though I have asked more than once, they wont tell me exactly what the issue is, but after checking my credit profile there was a note on there to say that if you have 3 or more unsecured loans it can negatively impact your credit rating, so as I have 3 device plans under my name (mine, my partners and my sons) I can only but guess, that this was the problem. I don't have any other substantial loans, I don't have an overdraft and only have a small amount on my credit card (under £200). I would say my credit profile is ok from what I can see and the only thing that's stopping vodafone from renewing my device plan is their loans they gave me. 2 of the 3 device plans would be cleared upon the upgrade with just 1 remaining so don't see the issue?Another issue is they ask you to clear the device plan as the first bit of the upgrade process and then do the credit check for the new device plan, the credit check should be done first because now we have cleared the device plan (1 year remaining) and was going to use the trade in value for our old phone to offset it, but now out of pocket as the refuse to cancel the clearing of the device plan.I will be taking my business elsewhere after 20 years. taking every phone line and broadband away from them as I feel annoyed and let down that I am encouraged to scoop all mobiles and broadband under one account to get savings, but then my credit profile is at risk as I have multiple unsecured loans on my profile for all the devices on the account.If my partner and son managed their own mobile phones on their own account their device plan would be in their own name and be reflected on their own credit profile.*Bear the above in mind, when consolidating all your services!*",0
"My phone's screen broke and I ordered a new one from Vodafone on January 4th,2025. I received an e-mail with Delivery date:Delivery on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025, between 8am-6pmIt hasn't been delivered. excatly hasn't been despatched (January 10th,2025)I have contacted with an adviser on web site chat and said to me that your order already despatched and will be delivered today.There is no any delivery, any despatch. There is no any notice about delay.Shopping from Vodafone is a complete regret.If I bought it from Amazon on the 4th, it would be delivered on the 5th.I don't recommend anyone to shop from Vodafone",0
"Absolutely shocking that after 4 months of trying to get something very simple resolved. Nobody takes any notice, promises to call back do not happen, obstructive in contact, however, still send threatening emails. I will be sending all of the evidence of my contact to no avail over the last 4 months and Vodafone's inability to help and support their customer. Its ok for a customer to continue to try and get help and be put on hold time after time for a minimum of 15 minutes...still no resolution.",0
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS USELESS DONT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.ALSO APPLIED FOR SOCIAL TARIFF SUPPOSE TO GET A CALL BACK IN 3 DAYS TOOK OVER A MONTH AND FILLED OUT FORM 4 TIMES.ITS LIKE THE OLD SAYING PAY PEANUTS GET MONKEYS.BUT CHARGE CUSTOMERS TOP DOLLER,0
"Dear Vodafone Team,I recently moved back to Vodafone, believing it was the right decision, but I was sadly mistaken. Since rejoining at the end of December, my experience has been riddled with errors and frustrations.I have had to chase and call nearly every day, spending hours on the phone, which has caused immense stress, financial loss, and the inconvenience of being without a functioning phone or network.Here is a summary of the issues I have faced:1. Porting Failure: The porting process for my number has still not been completed, even after more than 14 days.2. SIM Issues: My original SIM was cancelled, a new SIM was issued, and yet there has been no resolution.3. Service Charges: I have been charged for a service that I have not been able to use.4. Network Unavailability: I have been left without network access, rendering my phone unusable.5. Lack of Communication: Neither AI nor customer service informed me that my order did not go through, leaving me in the dark.6. Poor Customer Service: Attempts to resolve these issues have been met with inadequate support, further adding to my frustration.This level of service is unacceptable and reflects poorly on Vodafone’s commitment to its customers.I feel deeply let down by the lack of efficiency and transparency in handling my case.I sincerely hope Vodafone can act quickly to resolve this matter and restore my trust in your services.Complaint reference: 126722239",0
Online customer service is awful. The purpose is to make resolving issues easier for people who may have access issues for phone or in person.You speak with a bot that is not very good at redirecting unless for basic issues. I also spoke with 3 different advisors who gave different advice to resolve an issue with the final one helping me only.,0
"Bit strange how some people still get the feel good Friday rewards every single week, and I for one haven't had one for months. Meant to be a random draw now, not very random when the same person gets it all the time. Maybe random means something different these days.",0
"I've left 2 times, I've confirmed by phone, I've had my connection transfered away and still they keep billing.You cannot email anyone, dreadful organistion",0
"I was fortunate to receive a free Vodafone SIM card for six months due to my financial situation. After that period, I signed up to continue with the same pay-as-you-go SIM for £10 a month. When I was able to upgrade, a cold caller informed me that I was eligible for a contract SIM, and I accepted the offer.Two weeks later, I received a text saying I qualified for a contract SIM that was now £20 cheaper. I was excited and decided to proceed with it. The representative assured me she would cancel my previous contract for the new one.However, I now find myself paying for two SIM cards because I have two contracts that, unfortunately, cannot be terminated until 2026 when both contracts expire.Happy New Year to you too!",0
Wishing I could turn the clock back. Switched broadband provider from Sky to Vodafone on 08 Jan. Openreach engineer set it up and explained it would be up and running within an hour. Three days and hours on the phone to Vodafone later still no service. Vodafone say there is a problem with the Openreach box. Openreach attended today and find absolutely no fault with the setup. They call Vodafone and tell them to resolve at their end. Totally clueless operator says it will work this time. No it didn’t. Three days without internet and I have no confidence that Vodafone know what they are doing and can actually fix the issue. Next step will be to cancel the contract and go back to Sky or A.N Other. I really do wish I could turn the clock back and wish I hadn’t fallen for Vodafone’s marketing hype and cheaper monthly contract.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with my experience with Vodafone over the past week following ""upgrading"" my mobile phone.After upgrading on 6th January the courier arrived on 7th and the driver claimed he didn't have the phone and then on the 8th they failed to deliver the phone (DPD strikes again) and then proceeded to return the parcel to Vodafone. Vodafone then received the mobile phone back to the warehouse and despite me being told they would simply send the phone out again they completely cancelled the order and will no longer honour the original deal. They have now unfortunately lost a customer. I was also looking to add additional plans for two of my children over the next two months but I will no longer be willing to do this.",0
"I confirmed a phone and sim package upgrade online and it stated I needed to call in person to confirm.The price was £10 for the sim 50GB Xtra (which should include roaming in 51 countries) and £24 for the phone contract.I called to confirm the order and they stated the sim contract did not include the EU roaming and it would be £14. And then phone contract would be £26. Seems like they’re secretly trying to make money. Biggest waste of multiple hours. I can’t comprehend how an order can be placed online, call to confirm and they quote a completely different price.",0
"got full fibre 900mbps but after every month of having the internet the speed got slower and slower and slower, i know they do this so they can save as much power as possible, so long story short if you get high download internet from vodafone they will make it slower overtime until you start complaining, mine is at 50-70 mbps max hasn’t went higher for atleast 6 months. i need to change internet but i work all week and don’t have time to call them as their customer service is horrendous so hard to even get through to anyone end of the day just don’t join vodafone if you need fast internet (i’m a gamer btw)",0
"I experience daily network outages, minimum once a day, sometimes more. Each of those outages lasts around 3 minutes. I contacted their technical support multiple times, but it's a waste of time. They do network status checks, which I can do myself via the app. They check network health, which I can do myself too. They say that they do not see any issue. Well, they will not see it, as the issue is intermittent. They also tell me to contact them when the issue occurs, not understanding that:1) When I lose network connection, I do not have the internet so cannot chat with them. I have no mobile data in the place I live.2) Issues are intermittent and for ~3 min - it takes longer for their chat-bot to figure out what to do with a case.Vodafone service is unreliable and their help or ""expert service"" recommendation seems like a token gesture. Their support say ""We do not see the issue now, we cannot report it"" - such an insightful observation, totally unhelpful though.",0
"Complete disaster.Signed up for full fibre top tear, changing from Virgin.Confirmed installation date, had texts from city fibre to confirm and all confirmed and less than 2 days after placing order random message that installation and account closed as my request.... Which I didn't do...And to tap it off stuck on hold with India call centre trying to resolve.No thanks... Off to Zen I go.",0
Absolutely hate the customer servicewhen i closed my old vodafone account they put a S for settle on my credit agremeent even though it was paid on time and with no issues - they affected my credit rating.Secondly - i recently went back to Vodafone for broadband - i have WASTED the last hour trying to speak to a a human - took 45 minutes bouncing around from automated system their online system is TOTALLY useless aswell - didn't accept the security pin even though it was correct an verified.,0
"I have finally cancelled my Vodafone broadband after two years of terrible connection and even worse customer service. Long waiting call centre times, staff unable to understand or help with issues and one of the most expensive packages out there. The average call time is typically over an hour, frequently cutting out and having to call back several times for a basic request. Happy to move over to Community Fibre!",0
"DO NOT SIGN UP WITH VODAFONE. I have used them for 10 years plus. But recently their service has been extremely poor. Their broadband is either constantly down or slow. The customer service team do not help and refuse to find any solutions, leaving the customer stressed. This is unacceptable from a service provider I have been a long term customer with.",0
DONNOT EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING ANY CONTRACT WITH THESE SCAMMERS … ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS UOUR MONEY 💰 THEY DONT CARE ABOIT CUSTOMERS ORIENTATION. Nope 👎🏾 please Go for EE NETWORK THEY ARE WAY BETTER AND CHEAPER AND MORE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY 👌🏽,0
"Absolutely disgusting customer service!!!  Anyone thinking of taking out a contract with Vodafone please thing twice !!   They are trying to block me from having a contract with another provider by saying I want to switch to them, I only asked them what the deal was and they’ve told my provider I want to switch to them, which I never agreed any contact with them,  I spoke with a Zama a customer service agent who was so rude and refused to take me off the switch, I have not agreed a contract and they haven’t sent me anything, all I can say if you want to save yourself a lot of time and hassle as each time I ring they keep putting me on hold ( up to 1 hour a time)  use another provider!!",0
"City fibre installed the cables that was all ok, however when they tried to boot the router it wouldn't work.citt fibre are saying that the router is faulty and they spoke with Vodafone who will send another.i waited 24 hours for Vodafone to contact me about delivery but heard nothing from them. This is where it went really wrong, Vodafone customer service is really appalling,they are denying it's the router and are saying I have to wait four days for city fibre to sort it out. I was with the city fibre engineers when they spoke to Vodafone and I heard Vodafone say to the engineer that they would send a new router out to me but are now denying to me that they said that.i have spent two hours on the phone trying to sort it but they are insisting it's not there fault and that I have to wait four days for city fibre to respond.terrible customer service, I'm going to spend the weekend finding a different supplier,avoid Vodafone is my recommendation.",0
"Chose to switch to Vodafone from BT. Fibre broadband provided by City Fibre. Initial date was 16th Dec 2024. There was an issue with installing the fibre from my home to the cabinet due to a ducting fault outside my home. City Fibre (I have a separate review from them) said the fault would be fixed in a day or so. Didn't happen and when I contacted, I was told by City Fibre the date would be 7th Jan. Vodafone were aware of this via City Fibre but omitted to inform me. City Fibre although not a customer facing organisation did in fact provide me with this information via a real person - not Vodafone's extremely poor TOBi thing :(On 7th Jan, nothing had happened and I contacted City Fibre again to be told the new date was 10th Feb. Again Vodafone knew but simply didn't let me know. I wrote a negative review of City Fibre and they came today (16th Jan 2025) and seemed to have resolved the issue.Later today I received a message from BT that my service would be stopping. The Vodafone router still had not synced and had no internet. So I'm in a position where I could lose my working BT Broadband and have no Vodafone Broadband. Remarkably bad. Why turn off a working system when the replacement has not been verified. BT dropped this evening at 10pm, but a reboot seems to have brought it back for now - I'm using it to write this.So this ""One touch switch"" is worse than doing it yourself as at least that way you know you won't be without an important broadband connection.Oh, to use TOBi effectively, you need a PIN. You can't set the pin unless you activate your online account, which you can't do if the service isn't live. I'd love to see the test plan for that feature set. At least today, the third time I spoke to an adviser, I was told that they could set a PIN for me. Third time lucky.I look forward to Vodafone's response :)",0
Tell you you're eligible for upgrade then refuse to give you a new phone or even let you go withthem for home broadband after being a loyal customer and never missing a payment will be taking my business elsewhere,0
"Broadband!Don't bother, constant problems with it. Won't let you out of contract even when their internet won't work. Wasted hours on the phone to them. Have left us without WiFi for days. Disappointed as when buying mobile, they were helpful. Avoid Vodafone broadband.",0
"Hi Everyone,I have been using vodafone for past 12 years when it used to be the one of the best network even though expensive but i was happy because of quality of service they were providing as i don't want stress with signals. However, for past 1 year the quality of service went below then every other one,even with full signals 4g or 5g will disappear automatically while on whatsapp call then come back after wait. I spoke to the customer service to cancel or fix the issue but then they told me your contract is finishing in June and helped me fixing some stuff with internet in my mobile but still no improvement. I realise the ppl in my circle is facing same issue and thinking of moving from vodafone. Stay away from vodafone!!!",0
"So I thought they deserve another bad review. Spent 3 days last week being asked to change settings as I am still not getting the service I pay for. Needless to say nothing fixed it. There's no problem with our mast, they said. This arrived today Hello. Great news - we've fixed the problem with our mobile network in , which means everything should now be up and running again as normal. Sorry again for the disruption to your service, and thanks for your patience while we were getting things fixed. Still having trouble? Please get in touch with us free on 191 from a Vodafone mobile.Shame it still doesn't work. They know there service is rubbish because they won't even compensate me anymore or even take a complaint from me.Edit so tried Toby and X. I don't use anything else thanks for NO help whatsoever EE here I come.",0
"Worst customer service ever received. BT accidentally damaged the connection to my house. Spent a month trying to resolve, repeatedly being told to turn the router on and off and see if that works?!?!When i called to cancel, spent ages on the phone and had it completed. As with other feedback on here no cancellation was processed.Was told I’d be compensated for having no internet for a month. Guess what…..I don’t write reviews. The fact I’ve bothered here is a strong indication of why you should avoid any dealings with Vodaphone.",0
"Previously the last activation date was 6 December when an Open Reach engineer appeared but nothing happened! Another activation date was set for today 3 January - same result - the Open Reach engineer appeared but nothing has happened!! I will now have to wait a further 4 weeks at least. That is 3 months to get connected since I signed my deal! And I have absolutely no confidence that anything will happen then either.I want ACTION not empty promises from Vodafone who are are full of fine empty words which, frankly, are just LIES. I can't even phone them as all I get is a pre recorded message and then they terminate the call!!! I wish I had never agreed to switch providers.",0
"Worst service ever, I waited for 3 months for them to repair my phone, and they failed to do it, they replaced it with a shit phone and lied about it.",0
"Went into Winchester store today (11/01/2025) shop was empty, first staff member who was on his phone looked up and passed us onto another member of staff as he clearly couldn’t be bothered with us. Second member of staff sat us down, we explained we wanted to upgrade my wife’s phone from an IPhone 6 as we were still paying £41 per month for an old phone, so wanted to upgrade and reduce monthly.  After 10 mins of I don’t know what he was doing, we were told we could get a iPhone 14 for £52 per month…..sorry, did you not hear what we wanted to do? Asked him if there were any other options…..yes, we could get a refurb phone!!!! I have a new iPhone 13 with Tesco mobile with unlimited everything for £30 per month…..  when I said that we would not be doing an upgrade and will therefore be leaving the store AND Vodafone, he shrugged his shoulders, said nothing and we left. No customer service, no smiles, no help in trying to find the right product at the right price….Vodafone, sack them, there are enough people around that would love to work and give a decent experience to your customers.  From a now FORMER Vodafone customer of over 20 years…",0
Once again charged for out of plan for something I did not use.Stay away from Vodafone. Once I am home I will be looking for a new phone and broadband service.,0
My wife purchased a new phone from a Vodafone shop yesterday. We have discovered today that a member of staff posted a review without our knowledge. We find this behaviour appalling and should not be allowed by Vodafone.Please let us know what action you will take to ensure this sort of thing doesn't happen again,0
MIS SOLD AIR TIME CONTRACT. I was having difficulty using my phone abroad and called for help. While on the phone the advisor said he could make my air time contract cheaper. I was reluctant to do this as I only had 3 months to go on the current one and wanted to change provider. He assured me that I can cancel any time with no charge. I twice questioned this and was told yes I can cancel any  time no cost. On phoning to get a PAC code I was told it will cost me £245 to leave. I asked if they could check the call to see that I was told no charge. Yes they record calls. No they don't have mine. Yes I still have to pay to leave. No they won't budge. I have had 5 contracts with Vodafone for about 15 years. So next step for me is a complaint to Offcom and to trading standards,0
"I ported my network to other network and I was initially told ill get full refund which is there in my vodafone account, but unfortunately today when I called for refund 5% cancellation fees were applied which was very annoying, it seem whenever yhe provider wants they get different policy in place as per situation and never advice before.Shame and I would never recommend anyone for vodafone.I did not had any contract it was pay as u go i have to recharge bundle every month",0
"So so bad !! Especially the manager Leonard no way … he doesnt know to talk to customers only shouting and no helping . Just to get the sim ı had 3 days and still no solution .. never going to this shop again, the way of talking is so bad…..😡😡😡",0
"Moved house, told it would be fine and all set up. 3 days later after activation date I have no internet and every advisor I speak to has a different excuse why and tells me to wait and it will come on. I haven't been able to work and have lost money because of this, apology offer from Vodafone for 2 days lost income and no internet with no end in sight? £6. AVOID!",0
"Signed up to broadband in October, the engineer didn’t ask where I’d like the cable to run. The cable looked ridiculous and I asked them to remove it for that reason, the neighbour complained it was on her property and the fact it had damaged my 3 month old render. Refused to do anything about it so cancelled after 3 days. I’m now receiving debt collection letters for £60. Would be laughable if I wasn’t about to remortgage and wasn’t ignored by the complaints department. See you in court Vodafone.",0
The customer service was very rude and unprofessional.i have  being using mobile and WiFi connection to my residence for so many years but when i wanted to get my prepaid existing number change of my daughters to monthly plan the agent dint even care to offer me the packages instead trying to promote me a new number once. I scanned the qr for customer feedback his total actions change and was more friendly.but I still don’t want to complain but had to now after even so many times requesting for the same number to be activated he has just activated a new number when we put the new SIM card by the agent.i expected more better customer service from this outlet.,0
"I am moving house and have so far spent over an hour trying to get through to someone on the helpline. The line then cuts me off.  They are now going to ring me back at 17:00 today. For a process that should be simple as alluded to online, this has so far been a nightmare with the robot chat sending me round in circles. I will update if we are successful with our change! Seriously thinking of changing providers.",0
"I ordered my broadband 3 weeks ago. Despite getting several messages confirming the installation today 7 January 2025, nobody pitched up. I was quite clear to the person signing me up that they would have to send an engineer to do the installation as there is a loose fibre wire lying here and not connected to anything. I took a days unpaid leave to make sure that I would be home to let them in and I have the router connected as much as I can according to their instructions but nobody turned up. I phoned in to Vodafone and I was told that they would have to get an engineer in, which I told them 3 weeks ago and they confirmed that, but the engineer would only be here in 10 days, so I lost today's pay and now they say I must take another day off and wait for the engineer to come. I subsequently cancelled the order and now it is up to me to return their hardware.  Why can these big companies not just do what they say. Back to the drawing board for me",0
"Worst experience I have had as a customer. I paid every bill on time.I left Vodafone several months ago for another Internet provider and was refunded an amount I was owed a couple of months after the account closure. I have not had any communication from Vodafone since until receiving a letter today to state they have sent me to a collection agency for £19.98, leaving a default record with the credit agency!! From a quick look online I am not the first they have done this to and clearly don't care enough to fix whatever issue is causing them to send prior customers to a collection agency for no reason.",0
So slow it spoilt our TV viewing new years eve. Did the Vodafone checks which just confirmed the signal to be very unstable and only achieving 6Mbs.Can't be relied upon.Will contact City Fibre as Vodafone don't take any responsibility.,0
"Update: Its 2025 and since Christmas my vodafone speed has dropped to under 100mbps when I should be getting 700-900mbps. I haven't changed anything or connections is just suddenly started doing this. Of course this is not the first time, in the past engineers have been out and not been able to fix it. £36 per month for this crap is daylight robbery, they never reimburse you either. Trying to get help means you have to sign in here and there and passwords never work that's why I gave up with their stupid app which is another piece of garbage. I've never used it since my last review. Update:11th Jan 2025 I received a text message to re register my account, I went there then got told my accounts been locked temporary. I've already waited 48 hours to hear that. I am still getting less than 90mbps instead of at least 700 with my paid for 900mbps speed account. Really annoyed to say the least as I know they wont re emburse me for all this time wasting and crap service because its happened in the past so many times and I was never compensated.",0
"Customer Service is SHOCKING!I understand that companies often choose to outsource their customer service functions, but Vodafone has become unbearably difficult to deal with when problems arise. For me, a truly great company is defined by how it resolves issues, not by its sales tactics—and Vodafone is falling far short in this regard.I’ve been passed from one representative to another, from South Africa to India and everywhere in between. None of the representatives I’ve encountered seem empowered to truly empathize or assist; instead, they simply repeat the same scripted responses over and over again like robots.Getting through to someone—whether by phone or their chat system—takes an eternity. To make matters worse, I was just four days late on a payment, and yet I’ve been bombarded with threatening emails and texts, even warnings about debt collectors. Four days! This level of response is excessive and unwarranted.What on earth has happened to Vodafone? If I could leave today, I absolutely would.",0
"As an existing broadband customer I assumed it would be easy to add a couple of sim only mobile plans, how wrong I was! Thought it would be easy using the live chat, After wasting my time with the useless digital assistant, was supposedly transferred to chat with an actual person, ended up in a queue , and eventually just gave up . Totally useless !",0
Dreadful broadband experience with pro 2 boosters. they are not proper mesh and dont work well. vodafone helpdesk even advised to turn them all off every few days to prevent them overheating. I cancelled within 14 days (they also would not follow the terms of their own contracts to allow me to leave between day 14 and day 30 as per their terms for pro broadband. be warned!!!!!,0
Vodafone is the worst mobile phone company had to deal with. Cancelling contract to a different provider is not straight forward will never ever use Vodafone in the future. Changing my daughter's contract was a nightmare getting money out of you after changing to a different company. Vodafone don't deserve one star surprised the staff putting up with their stupid rules.,0
"Terrible online portal that never works or accepts payments. You are then charged a late payment fee, even though you have no access to your account online to pay. You are then disconnected and once you pay you are not re-connected immediately. In fact its been 4 hours since payment and no connection. No support, can't log in to the account portal. No humans to rectify the problem.Terrible network with no support and crap cell coverage.",0
"Third time chasing up compensation for broadband loss for 8 days (20/10/20).Apparently no UK call centre, only a bot service (TOBi) a chat line to I am assuming India. Three times I have explained the problem, besides having to read through previous conversations the guys there try to help.All I can say about Vodaphone Broadband is that when it works it works well. Have a serious fault with that service and require help, turn to a wall and talk to it !!!.",0
"Am more than three weeks into a nightmare with Vodafone routers restarting by themselves and cutting me off in the middle of important work meetings.I have serious health issues and have to work from home with Vodafone having caused incredible stress and worsening of my health due to their appalling technical service.Vodafone broadband technical help desk support staff are super nice and follow up on calls but are following scripts like computers and are obviously trained to deflect from the actual faults with Vodafone equipment and have no technical training .Instead of getting advanced technical support to investigate why their routers restart by themselves on a regular basis they keep blaming the network, and my electric connections, which Openreach engineers, which Vodafone sent can show me clearly are working.I now had disrupted work and endless stress since before Christmas with no compensation, no alternative solutions provided by Vodafone and no resolution to the problem with their routers.Will continue to post updates.17/01/25 - Vodafone just admitted on a recorded call with me that they don't have engineer support for their service, and refuse to replace the faulty router the sent me. Appalling service. Will be looking for alternatives and will continue posting updates on my ongoing nightmare with them. Vodafone forum is full of complaints of their routers resetting themselves so demand routers being replaced until they get to you one what works.18/01/25 - router restarted at least half a dozen times yesterday  losing internet connectivity and again several times this morning and it is only 07:00. This is a ""new"" router Vodafone provided earlier in the week. Obvious headway and software problem with their routers they refuse to admit",0
"This review is not for any specific individual offering new contracts. Vodafone loves new contracts, however transparency and maintaining loyal customers is a different matter. I travelled to France and Spain for 10 days 8 of those were Roaming charges in excess of £300 pounds! Never offered a bundle but only a message that I had used ‘too many Gigs’ what on earth is a gig I asked and could not receive an answer.I wasn’t taught in school what data usage amounts to a Gigs nor did I receive any messages from Vodafone each time I had used a Gig. The only time I was told that was when I received a message from them that my next bill would be £330! My monthly agreement was £39 per month so a bill over £300 was a shock. Customer service while abroad couldn’t be reached because they had also cut off my wifi, so no way of contacting anyone including Vodafone, who sent me messages but couldn’t respond. Vodafone completely ruined my vacation. After 15 years with the firm the best thing I’ve done is leave them for another provider. A reminder that when you’re told ‘unlimited’ on your agreement from Vodafone, it really means limited and any additional charges most likely be more than an annual contract. Another example of corporate greed.",0
Vodafone have associated an incorrect phone number to my account and will therefore not allow me to access it online or via the phone. I fear the only way around this is simply to leave the company as despite answering half a dozen other security questions they refuse to allow access to the account.,0
"Reported a complaint told response time would be 72 hours that was 3 weeks ago and still waiting when an agent told me registered blind, disabled and housebound customer to pop down to my local store to get help talk about rude and discriminatory behaviour is that Acceptable ?The reply I got was reach out to our social media team what part of  BLIND  did Vodafone not get?????",0
"18 months of a terrible service.... Constant dropouts. Enough said, never again.",0
"The worst customer service experience of my life!!!!Long story short I received a notification about an outstanding balance on my device plan on the 10/1/2025 which paid immediately.After I'd made  the payment and contacted Vodafone, they advised me after 20 +minutes going through the same information that the payment would take 24 hours to update.However, on 16 January 2025,my phone service was barred. Despite 13 attempts to contact the free customer service number, being left on hold and also having the phone disconnected by Vodafone, the issue remained unresolved.The customer service team said I'd failed to pay the outstanding balance of £21.00 even though I have photographic evidence (screenshots from my banking app) that I offered to email them. Said customer service advisors informed me that Vodafone don't have an email address??? Unlikely don't you think?  I told one of the customer service advisors that my mental health has severely been affected by this as I have been going through a very difficult time at the moment, due to being in temporary employment and the added pressures of the financial impact this has had on me. I have ADHD and its proven very difficult to find a permanent role.To which I was greeted with radio silence from the advisor and a very patronising and uninterested tone. They do say if you want a job doing do it yourself and so I spent yesterday afternoon having to visit my bank for payment details and then a Vodafone store to resolve the issue, because the customer service advisors left me on hold. The whole situation caused me to leave work early because the stress and constant pressure made it impossible to concentrate at work and as a result I lost 4 hours pay.If I hadn't visited my bank or the Vodafone store yesterday, my phone would most likely still be blocked due to no fault of my own.The lack of empathy, professionalism and respect is absolutely disgraceful and I dread to think how many customers have to put up with this.I'm lucky that I have the support of friends and family, but for customers who are alone, and in severe mental or financial difficulty, an experience like this could really drive them to despair. I got a robotic, lacklustre response to my complaint with £10 Compensation against my next bill! Such an insult. I'm looking forward to July 2025 when my contract ends and I can leave Vodafone for good.Absolutely shocking service, received and to be penalised for actually paying your bill is beyond a joke. I would avoid Vodafone at all costs!!",0
"Setting up a new broadband account and it got cancelled. Then the new one was agreed to be set up on the 10th Jan as requested. However, all emails now say the 17th, after speaking to customer services again they cannot help me and no one shared that this was going to be the date. Really let down",0
"On the 1st of January, I bought a Vodafone sim card for a mobile phone with 40GB pay as you go. The next day, I called them to get a refund of my £20 because the Internet connection was weak and constantly breaking. They told me that because of ""government works to improve something in my area, the Internet is weak to the end of January."" I asked for the manager but they never contacted me. Nobady else in Vodafone could find anything about ""government working in my area"" when l called them again on the 5th of January.Under the Consumer Protection Act of 2015, l should get back my money if the product doesn't work.The CEO and management of Vodafone seems to believe that my £20 is very important to the existence of the company.Meantime I tried SMARTY, which has very competitive offers, but sadly, their Internet had the same problem. SMARTY's friendly and professional customer service very quickly refunded my money.",0
Vodaphone most rubbish network on this earth and three both connected because crap customer service appaling rudness at branch for charging phone and promotion of bollocks in everyone faces I don’t wanna go on an app only to find naked men or women on there you’re a network provider not a Ann summers or porn site since we all have access to this rubbish we can all see it but what’s the need for it we don’t wanna see people unecarry body parts since there are married and unmarried people don’t force us to see what we don’t wanna see so callled very NOTme rewards my ass promoting asses 24hoyrs a day,0
"I’ve been a Vodafone customer for years, but my recent experience has been incredibly disappointing. I have a SIM-only contract and was paying £11.44 last year. For the first time, I considered other providers because I was worried about running out of data and paying extra for roaming abroad.I visited the Vodafone store in Derry and spoke to customer service on the phone. I was reassured that a new deal would meet my data needs, so I stayed as a loyal customer. Unfortunately, the new deal didn’t provide enough data, so I had to increase it. Even after doing that, it still wasn’t enough, and I had to increase my data again. I’m now paying £16.20 per month, and most months I still run out of data.I’ve been back to the store and called customer service several times, but the only solution they offer is to add 1GB of data per month for an additional £7.25. This would bring my total to £23.45 for only 9GB of data and no roaming—far worse than deals available from other providers.My last visit to the Derry store was the worst. The representative was argumentative and unhelpful. I feel I was mis-sold this contract, and now I’m stuck with it until March 4, 2026.Avoid Vodafone! Their promises don’t match reality, and they don’t seem to value loyal customers.",0
"Further to the response to my earlier feedback, I can confirm that I have been liaising with Vodafone on X. However, it takes 20 minutes plus to get a response to the 'chat / DM' feature - which means it's far from user friendly.Example: ""Please explain the problem."" You do. 20 mins later a response.""Please confirm your tel number"" You do. 20 mins later a response.""Please can I have digit 1 and 4 from your security code"". You supply this. 20 mins later a response.Makes it challenging to have a coherent set of comms in any sensible timeframe.",0
"Terrible customer service, everything takes an age, no smiles, staff drinking juice at front desk,  another staff member rolled eyes. Not able to change trade in from post to instore option",0
I'd been with EE for two decades or more and decided to switch. What a big mistake. Vodafone is a kafkaesque nightmare. Even the complaint form produces a 404 error.  Nó attempt at remedy works. Really regret trying themPs I did as they suggested and dm'ed via Twitter but have heard nothing back,0
"I have been waiting for an installation date since I placed the order on 11/10/24 every time i speak with an advisor they tell me it will be done in 5 days obviously not as still waiting .i have just been advised the end of January must have given up on the 5 days spiel .problem is they are quick enough to cancel your existing broadband of which I cannot now cancel parts of my package and is costing me monthly for stuff I don’t use ,sky were delighted to tell me this as they continue to take money from me and advised if it takes 12 months they will continue to rob me for 12 months.so don’t use Vodafone as they will keep giving false information and to cancel all previous contracts personally to save yourself a lot of money.",0
"Made a mistake myself and husband but then the nightmare unleashed. We signed up whilst we were renovating the new house and instead of changing the dates for the installation, we cancelled the contracts within those 14 days. Recently, when we wanted to re-join, they messed up our credit check badly. Just so you are aware, once you've cancelled the contract with them, you'll be rejected 90 days afterwards if you want to re-join - it will say your credit check failed. I spoke to them via phone, chat and they sent me to Experian and once I opened a claim with them about my credit check, Experian raised a dispute with Vodafone and told me it was sorted. But no, it wasn't and also will block you from joining other suppliers online, where you can get the best prices and offers because your data will stay stuck on their system and the one of Open Reach so you will have more issues. It can be sorted but you have to pay a lot more for another provider to take over. And the messages and communication received from them were very misleading. I feel so sorry I made such a big mistake to deal with them, at my father's recommendation who's been with Vodafone Romania for over 20 years. Yesterday evening I spent 2 hours over the phone until Kelly managed to re-activate my account and that got me a massive headache which is still ongoing today. And that at a higher price than you find online. I understand I made a mistake but be careful because they do not specify all the unleashed mess which starts if you decide to cancel within 14 days, as per the consumer's rights and will cause you so much stress. If I manage to sort it with another provider, I will cancel it forever and tell to all the people I know to be aware and stay away from Vodafone. I got the best ""deal"" yesterday over the phone. 25£ for 150mgb when online you can buy it at 24£ plus a 90£ voucher. But they blocked me from being able to purchase it online...",0
"Worst company to deal with , I top up my phone to call 09083264512 and they restricted my access to that number , top of that I ve been on webchat for a refund 3 days and they couldn t process it after they confirmed I am eligible for it . The guy who I spoke with on the webchat doesn t have a clue how to do his job, I understand they hire cheap labour but at lest train them properly",0
"I wish I never gave any mind to Vodafone. I’ve only ever had broadband routers from them. My first router did not give me the speeds promised. Customer service is shocking, almost always you get connected to somebody in India with poor language. This time I have a 12 month contract with Vodafone, I have been overcharged since I started the contract 4 months ago, when I try to call Vodafone to resolve this, this is how it goes: I ring, they answer in India, I explain that they are overcharging me, that I have email proof for the £29 agreed, they tell me that all they can see on their screen is £39 which is what they are charging me. I tell them I can send them proof if they have email or if they screen share or send me a link to upload the screenshot of my email. They tell me that they will ask they’re manager to cal me, they’re manager at first didn’t, so I had to start all over again, they’re manage finally calls me and long story short, he can not do anything, he says he could only send me a link if I have a Vodafone mobile, his language is very poor, he confirms he is in India, he does not have the power to pass me to somebody in the UK and does have the power to resolve my issue. In the end he gives me Vodafone’s website address and asks me to chat to the team and upload my screenshot to them, I did laugh because it was that or cry. I asked why as a manger all he can do, is read out Vodafone’s website address. That was that, he wasn’t going to help no matter how hard I tried. I clicked the link and I am greeted with, HEY ITS TOBI THE ROBOT ASSISTANT, HOW CAN I HELP? Honestly this is the worst company ever and I will never use Vodafone again. Please be warned everybody. Use a local business or one like BT where at least you will be connected to real people and people in the uk 🇬🇧.",0
"I used the self-service option to request the porting of two numbers into Vodafone on the 13th and 14th of December. It has now been nearly a month, and the numbers have not been ported. To make matters worse, neither the original Vodafone numbers nor the ported-in numbers are working.I have attempted to resolve this issue through your online chat service, but the chatbot refuses to transfer me to a human agent. I have also called multiple times without success. This situation is unacceptable, and I am now considering reporting the matter to OFCOM.Vodafone has lost my numbers in the porting process, and they are now stuck somewhere in your system. This issue needs to be resolved immediately, as I will not tolerate any further delays.This matter needs to be prioritised and demand that a swift remedy is assured.Can someone respond to my complaint so that I can provide all the details to get this mess sorted.I made a big mistake choosomg to port into Vodafone. I now regret itI don't use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, so please provide an email address to contact you.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with Vodafone's service and their complete lack of professionalism. They agreed to install my internet on September 10th, but never showed up. Since then, they have rescheduled the installation six separate times, each time with little notice and delays of up to 30 days.Each time I called to confirm that everything was in place, they reassured me that they were ready to go, only for the installation to be cancelled again the day before it was supposed to happen. This has caused immense frustration and inconvenience, and it's clear that Vodafone has no regard for their customers’ time or commitments.If you are looking for reliable service and a company that actually values your business, I strongly advise you to avoid Vodafone. Their incompetence and terrible customer service have left me completely dissatisfied.UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO REPLY FROM VODAFONE: They've asked me to contact them on socials as a token gesture to appear people reading this review but they've ignored me there too. Horrific service.",0
"I am writing to formally raise a complaint about the exceptionally poor service I have received, particularly from the Milton Keynes branch, as a loyal Vodafone customer of 10 years. The series of issues I have faced over the past several months has been incredibly frustrating, time-consuming, and ultimately unresolved.I initially began experiencing service issues in August 2024, when I had no access to my phone for two weeks. Due to work commitments in a different city, I was unable to address the issue immediately. Upon returning, I visited the MK branch, where I was told that the problem was caused by an old SIM card. However, despite the fact that the account is in my name and the phone belongs to me, I was informed that no action could be taken because my father pays for the service. My father, who is 68 years old and suffers from dementia, Parkinson’s, and poor mobility, is unable to leave the house easily. Even after explaining this, the staff at the MK branch offered no apology or assistance, and I was sent away without a resolution.The following week, I had no choice but to bring my father into the store in a wheelchair to update the account and receive a new SIM card, which should have been done in the first place. This issue was somewhat resolved for a short period, but in December 2024, my service dropped once again, this time for a more extended period.On December 28, 2024, my service dropped again and did not return. I returned to the MK branch, where I was told that the issue was hardware-related, not the SIM card. I was assured by both Sunny and another store manager that I would not incur any charges for repairs, and it was suggested that I return in the new year to send off the phone for repairs, as this would be quicker.I returned on January 7, 2025, to send the phone off for repair. I was assisted by Avril, who seemed unsure of the process and stated that she ""wasn’t very good at this."" After some assistance from the store manager, I was informed that my warranty had expired just a week prior to my visit. I inquired if there was any possibility of disputing the repair charges, as I had previously visited the store within my warranty period, and was assured by Sunny that everything would be handled, and I should not worry. However, the interaction felt rushed and dismissive, especially as the store was nearing closing time.On January 17, 2025, I received my phone back in the mail, still broken, along with a letter stating that the repair could not be completed due to the warranty expiry. The letter also mentioned that they had attempted to contact me, but I have not received any emails or messages regarding this matter. This is entirely unacceptable. I am now left without a working phone and still being billed for the service.I am deeply dissatisfied with the entire process, the lack of communication, and the ongoing inconvenience this has caused. I have invested a significant amount of time visiting the store, engaging in live chats, and speaking on the phone, only to be left with no resolution and no confidence in the repair process. I was assured multiple times that this issue would be resolved, but I am now at square one, with no solution in sight.As part of the resolution to this matter, I would appreciate a full refund for the two-week period in August 2024 when I had no access to my phone, as was initially promised. Additionally, I request that this issue be escalated to ensure a proper resolution, including repair or replacement of my phone at no cost, given the ongoing nature of the problem and the significant delays caused by Vodafone's lack of communication and support.Please consider this letter a formal complaint. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will be forced to take further action, including escalating the complaint to the relevant regulatory bodies. Should this issue be resolved, please be assured that I will be discontinuing my relationship with Vodafone after 10 years of service.I look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely,Chloe MayockAnthony Mayock",0
"We had to call up to get to grips with my Dad's vodafone contracts as he has brain cancer and we're getting his affairs in order.From start to finish, over the course of about an hour of attempting to gain an understanding of his payment commitments and agreements with vodafone, we found ourselves utterly none the wiser due to painfully unclear communication from the agent, who repeatedly insisted on gaining agreement from my Dad for my mother and myself to be granted insight despite having apparently satisfactorily achieved this early on and my Dad being fatigued and experiencing difficulty talking. (He was twice put on the line to the agents satisfaction, but this ultimately wasn't good enough).As we had to ask for clarity over and over, the agent eventually became noticably annoyed and snippy and we were ultimately passed on to another department whom he failed to sufficiently advise of the situation, so we were once again asked to put my Dad on the line which I refused to do.I was declined the opportunity to complain to a senior and instead fobbed off to their website, but guess what, I've ended up here.All we wanted to know was what services his direct debits to vodafone were for. We still don't know.The experience was exhausting and agonising.Dreadful.",0

Before Christmas I contacted Vodafone about my monthly bill. My bill had my old address even after updating and confirming my new address. I got my monthly bill amount and decided to make an early payment on the 13th December. I didn't want any issues in the same month especially during the festive period so I made the payment so I could get it out the way. Right after Christmas they took out a direct debit for the month and not only that I had to learn the bill was not correct with a £29 overcharge and they missed out the device costs when I requested the bill amount for the month.,0
Absolutely shoddy.. I’ve been with Vodafone for over 20 years and never had a problem until now… I can’t stop the contracts at the minute because I unknowingly started a new 2 year contract in November for my daughter by just uping her data.. when I also asked at the same time if I can change her phone into her name when she was 18 which was 4 weeks after uping her data’s… I was told yes I could .. I now can’t change her phone into her name because the new contract doesn’t run out till November 2026 unless I pay a cancellation fee... like I said I didn’t know that uping data would start a new contract.. also my bill has upped significantly with added airtime payments.. not only do I pay £120 a month added airtime payments are also added on which ups my bill by an extra £50+ ontop.. as soon as all the contracts I have are finished I’ll be changing phone company… absolutely shoddy and I’m so angry about going into a new contract by only uping data,0
"Poor data dongle with little justification for the £38/month.Also hard to understand how is Trustpilor pulling the 4.5 stars, with 34% of reviews of 1 Star, 1% with 2 Stars and 1% with 3%. Anyone with basic arithmetics would calculate 3.4 Stars…..",0
"Should have had Open reach engineer on 12/12 to install Vodafone Router. Didn't turn up and there was no prior notice or contact made. I contacted them next day but earliest new date 27/12. OR engineer came on 27/12, set up Router (or so he said) but said Vodafone had to activate the line so waited up until past midnight. No joy - no internet and no lights on Router except flashing red led on the front. Contacted Vodafone and followed instructions to try and remedy. Still no joy. He said he'd report it to The Back Office (?) as it seemed that Router was duff. He called phone on 30/12 to say there was further investigation to be done but if  new Router needed, it would take another 3 to 5 working days! I wish I'd never heard of Vodafone. No internet, no WiFi, no central heating, no TV entertainment, no contact via video to family for Christmas or New Year and we are 75 and 81 years old. I guarantee they wouldn't put their own grandparents through this and would make a supreme effort to put it right as soon as possible. Customer care? I don't feel it. 😔",0

Very unhappy with the customer service I have receivedI ran out of data and bought 1 GB to tide me over on my trip to London with my young childI noticed I had 2 charges on the bill - i rang and asked for the charge to be removed for the extra data and advisor removed the data I had boughtI then explained I wanted the data I had bought but I didn’t want the future charge for data and the advisor refused to put back the data back on as said I had asked for it to be removed which wasn’t the caseCommon sense surely would be for the advisor to question why I would ring up one day and agree to pays for an extra G of data to then ring back the next day and ask for it be removed 😡I spoke with a manager called Jacob and he again refused to put the date I had paid for back on and said if he did they would charge me againLeaving me in London with no data to get the maps working with a young child,0
"The worst experience ever. A lot of lies, extreme unprofessionalism and I can't even make any sense of their actions. I informed them that I need to stop my contract on the 24/07/2024 as I'm moving to another country.They kept me on the contract. Then I got a notice in October for a sudden disconnection. I wish they stopped the contract at that time.As I don't have access to my account, I can check all this only via my bank account... As I left the country permanently. The Vodafone app doesn't allow me to log in n requires the use of SIM as verification which is an invalid SIM. So even if I want to pay, there is no way. Except if I make an international call...On the 11/2024 they moved me to pay as you go and on the 01/2025 I saw that they sent two monthly bills for November n December! Unbelievable...They kept the contract going again... As I live now in another country, you can still keep sending me letters and you can still keep sending me text to a number that doesn't exist! The only thing that works is the email.On the 12/2024 they told me that I m moving to pay as you go and then on the 01/2025 they sent me the monthly bill.All this whilst I lost my credentials in the app from 08/2024! I don't have access to my account!Still on the 20th of January, whilst I don't have access to my account, no SIM card, the employees are incapable of terminating my contract.",0

"First, I filled out all the info on the website, and everything seemed okay; after hitting the ""Submit order"" button, I was redirected to a screen with a message saying that it might take ""up to 2 minutes."". 30 minutes later, it was still showing the same message. I contacted their support via chat, and they advised me to try again. So..., I tried again. I went to the final order confirmation screen and hit submit, but it got stuck again.I contacted the support again; TOBi (their ""AI"" chat) asked the same questions repeatedly, clearly losing all context from the previous session. Eventually, I connected to a super helpful agent who offered to create the account and manually sign me up for the broadband. It took forever, but we worked through all the details, verified my ID, did the credit check, and agreed to all the contractual details. Then, just as we were about done, the chat just disconnected. No message, no error. Just nothing,Reloaded the screen, only for a chat to start all over again. TOBi is pretty retarded, asking the same circuitous questions... Eventually, I got connected to a new agent. I asked if I could be transferred back to the previous agent and was told they couldn't do that. Had to answer all the security questions all over again (despite being logged in to the account at this point!)Long story short, the new agent said I'd have to start the whole process again, verify my ID, provide all my details, do a credit check, etc. At this point, I just said, ""No, thank you."" By this point, I had been trying to sign up for broadband for three hours, and I reached my limit. The agent was thankfully understanding, but yeah...I went with Plusnet. It literally took me 5 minutes to sign up, create an account, and transfer from my current provider. Amazing.",0
"My Vodafone broadband over time became extremely sluggish and I contacted Vodafone to find out the cause and I was told I was still on some old copper wire. As my home could not get full fibre, I was then sold a partial fibre upgrade which was meant to significantly improve the performance and Vodafone gave an assurance I would get a guaranteed minimum speed of 50Mbps download and about 18Mbps upload. Given I was getting less than 10Mbps on the copper line, I signed up for the upgrade. Post the upgrade, the performance is still the same. I am now trying to get the upgrade cancelled as I am still inside of the 14 days cooling off period but Vodafone customer service just keep passing me around from one team to another for such a simple cancellation request. The customer service is beyond a joke!",0
2 hours and 4 minutes on the phone to change my plan.  After 1 hr 50 mins they tell me unfortunately they can’t do it on the phone but I can do it online.  Stay on the phone I say and talk me through… 15 mins later they agree I can’t do it online.  Apparently someone will call me back now… I despair … 2 hours of my day wasted!!!!!!!!,0
"Unless you are prepared to take out a contract (very poor value for money) I would give Vodafone a wide berth. I took out a PAYG sim with them with a view to changing to pay monthly and was unable to upgrade to a contract when the 'great value' contracts they offered were impossible to access. Changed providers and was due a refund. Of course, they didn't want to pay out and after claiming I would be refunded, I had to chase them up when the refund failed to materialise. One hour of wasted time later, I was told they had 'ordered a refund'...so what did they do in the first place? I'll believe the refund when I see it. Poor customer service and treat their PAYG customers like garbage. Will never use this company again.UPDATE: As expected, the usual bog-standard reply pretending that they care. They don't. Already wasted my time 'reaching out' to you and I'm not going to waste more time doing it again. Just enjoy your rubbish review and hopefully it will put some people off using your dreadful service.",0

We will take it off. It came off, thinking all good. (Even though my credit score had not been restored to it’s original score)Then this morning again a missed payment.There are no words.

"Absolutely horrendousFor many years (20+) I’ve had my main contract phone, various business contracts and a tiny contract exclusively for use on my electric gates (which have a SIM card inside them).Having recently moved house, I needed to cancel the contract attached to the sim in the gates. Unfortunately, as it was set up many years ago and given the simple requirements, I have no idea what the pin is for the SIM card and am unable to receive messages sent to it as it’s in the gates at my precious home.Vodafone have made it completely impossible for me to cancel the contract and continue to take money from my account for a service I haven’t used for months and do not want any more. It’s impossible to get through on the phone and when I eventually did, they told me I needed to go into a store, which I explained was a massive inconvenience. Well, guess what, I’ve just been into a store who explained they can’t cancel the contract in store. He insisted on me trying to call from the store so he could potentially speak to them, but as ever, it’s impossible to get through. So I’m now completely stuck and apparently if I cancel the DD Vodafone will pass onto debt collectors and this will affect my credit record.Unbelievable",0
"Their customer service is a nightmare, with endless waits, they never understand the problem and have no resolutions.I have already written a review here but the only thing that they are able to say is to connect through social media for a solution which is quite ridiculous as I don't have them.I called customer support because I have a problem with the internet on my phone the advisor was completely unhelpful, rude, and did not provide any help she said that the manager would have called me in 1h but as I knew nobody called.I called again and the advisor said she would transfer me to a supervisor but as always even this person was unbothered to give a solution and said they said that the issue I have with my internet is not their problem.Absolutely unacceptable service!

"Vodafone sold me a 73Mb, min 37Mb fibre package. After installed, it didn't work for two weeks, had multiple disconnections, data drops, and very high latency. An actual download rate capped at 10Mb/s. Multiple tickets, never resolved, just repetitive diagnostics by support, basically consisting or router and ONT resets. not calling at requested times. I am a ex Broadband support officer, and network infrastructure support officer, i can measure my throughput accurately and have the graphs to prove it. Support never listens, and just read from scripts, even their second line ""experts"" are not technical in any way. Vodafone are mis-selling their broadband packages by vastly over estimating the speed people can get, and relying on the public not being able to test properly, or having the technical knowledge to prove things, or giving up when reporting a fault because they are just asked to reboot things over, and over, and over again. Note, I am disabled and have problems getting down on the floor. They have repeatedly asked me to get someone round to help me, and basically inferred if i don't they will close the fault. I managed to get one rep to read back one of my call logs and it stated I refused to do diagnostics because i couldn't get to the router.",0
Bad service coustomer relationsBad 7 years was a coustomer got my lPac code today will be search around for a new provider making sure its not 3G aswell as they have morged,0
"I’m sorry to say that in recent months we have found Vodafone in Hayward’s Heath absolutely diabolical in being helpful with situations that do not include signing a contract and buying a new phone.For example, my phone stopped working, we went into the store and we were told to send the phone off for assessment and repair as it was still under warranty. This was done and then two weeks later - without a phone, I received a letter that was sent back to say this was not done due to it being not under warranty. This was checked in store. I was without my phone for a month due to issues and mis communication and it is still not resolved. I had to buy a new phone with a new provider. It was blamed on them being a franchise and its Vodafone fault. That doesn’t help the customer and it’s just passing the buck. Personally, once the contract is up, I will not be going with Vodafone again. Apparently they can’t close accounts in store due to it being a franchise!",0
Moved for talk talk with no problems but got a better price from Vodafone. Had nothing but trouble since moved. The Vodafone router is rubbish and does not reach WiFi in to my room so rang Vodafone and now say I need a booster and need to upgrade. When I first took it out they said there modem was the best . Spent hours on phone what a bad service.,0
"I simply want to remove Alexa device from Vodafone One Number and add my iPaid Air with e-sim.* Spent all morning messaging Vodafone support on X* Spent an hour with Tobi BOT then human chat* Spent another hour on 191speaking to humansAfter all this i am no further forward!Complaint 1.  One of the support people transferred me to sales to get rid of me!Complaint 2.  A lady i spoke to tried her best for 30 minutes or so but in the end admitted she was unable raise anyone in technical!Complaint 3. Apparently what i want can only be done on 191 by speaking to technical, cannot be done on app or by lesser mortals.How does one get to speak to someone who has technical knowledge and access to systems to make changes? In the end i hung up and gave up.So, Vodafone when you reach out to me please do not suggest i call 191 but instead give a direct number to someone who knows their onions.I have lost a day put of my life and now have high blood pressure and generally a poor opinion of Vodafone.",0
Customer service is a joke!!!!! A Bot….then a call centre who leave you hanging on the phone until you hang off. Attempted for 2 weeks to get an issue resolved. Totally totally useless - AVOID,0
I come to shop and rude man only want to talk if sale if no sale he very rude man,0
My elderly parents have been without internet since before Christmas and they are not interested in solving the issues!,0
"Left us 7 days without broadband, and provided around 200mbs of speed while we are paying for 900mbs !!!The customer service we engaged with after installation kept lying to us about what will happen and that someone is working on the issue, instead it became apparent that they were simply hoping it will resolve itself.We first waited the 24 hours for internet to switch on. nothing. then 1st call they told us actually its 48 hours. nothing. 2nd call ok they tried something to fix it we need to wait another 24hours. nothing. then 3rd call same just give it couple hours. I persisted kept asking for update. nothing day 5 I started recording their conversations and said I would publish this to show people how rubbish they are. I even called the cityfibre who installed it. first got some headway with them they told me the status of the line, that its not them because the connection to the home is valid, but the Vodafone have not ACTIVATED it. its the router basically. Vodafone denied it. when threatened with recording and more they still persisted I have to wait and wait and wait. keep resetting router each time. nothing new. finally after a week of waiting the internet finally came on.We were some tired from that ordeal that we did not want to go to someone else, but now after 9 months of experience we should have. Internet is on 95% of the time, but sometimes randomly resets. looses connection despite router being on. this is annoying as I work from home and can be on a call with someone or you are watching a movie and it just cuts off have to wait 5 minutes for it to come back.Last straw was when I checked the speed just now. I was checking it few times throughout the 9 months and it was NEVER higher than 400mbs where they promised 450mbs minimum and the speed actually  should be 900mbs. today it was 180 - 220 mbs.My ping in games is 40 at best, usually 60. that is appalling level of broadband. I had better ping when had 15 mbs broadband 15 years ago.I am connecting to the router directly with fibre internet cable to my PC. so the measurement is as close to the broadband speed as can be.",0
"Switched to Vodaphone some years ago, and seemed to be nothing but problems.Regularly had trouble with my phone signal, after eventually getting through to support, they refused to accept the issue was on their end.  Swapping the sim card out, even replacing the phone, would not fix the issue.  When I would point out the various dead zones where the signal was poor at best, non-existent most of the time, they would refuse to say there was an issue (In spite of their own maps showing the area in question having poor/limited connections)Only had them call me on a few rare occasions, first was when my original contract was up, to inform me of changes to my pricing due to not being on a fixed contract.  Only found out a month later when looking at other providers, that they had decided to stick me onto a new fixed contract without any confirmation, and calls to get this fixed were met with a 'not our problem' attitude, meaning I was forced to stay with them, or be forced to pay a max of £400 to end the contract early.Next time they would call was when that contract was coming to an end.  Made sure to inform them that I didnt want to renew the contract and would be going to another provider, which was then met with a condescending, brattish attitude from the sales rep who tried to rely on scare tactics by warning about all the things I'd loose access to.The final set of times was after I have moved to a new provider.  Despite already being a few weeks into a contract with a new mobile service, they have repeatedly tried to offer me upgrades to my old contract, or incentives to rejoin.  Doesnt matter how much I say no, or say exactly why I dont want to rejoin, they refuse to take no for an answer, and kept trying to call back until I was forced to block their number.Absolutely worthless service that hides behind the lie of being the nations 'number 1 provider' while offering a poor service, terrible support, and dodgy chages to your contracts without any input from you.",0
"vodaphone poor service I've had no phone or broadband for over a week,service reception is somebody reading a script you cant understand,allways says the fault is in your house but I've had the same problem for years and its always external 3 poles up the road,WYE DONT THEY LISTEN?",0
"On Friday the 3rd January our internet became intermittent, It come on for 5 to 10 minutes and then goes off. I contacted Vodaphone 17 times to assist as my wife and I need the internet for work. I told them  on a number of occasions I  urgently needed it fixing. Like most people today we are reliant on the internet. They told me I needed to use a filter, something they claim to have provided when we opened the contract. I told them an engineer fitted it and we had nothing. We need the internet to control, our heating. I asked an engineer to call me before 10:30 on Saturday as I was going out, he called me at 12:59 when I could not answer the call, gave me a phone number to call up to 8 pm I called at 4 and it cut me off after introducing it was Vodaphone. On Saturday night I got through to an advisor after trying 4 times to contact Vodaphone using the call number and the bott. Every time I contacted them they struggled to find my account. They are now sending me a filter that will take up to 3 business days to get to me. The Advisor is calling me between 12 and 2 although I have told him I had to leave at 12 for a 120 mile journey, but i am supposed to delay this for me to tell him we still have no internet. But what will happen if the filter does not work? On Monday we are supposed to our bosses we cannot work at home until Vodaphone can be bothered to fix the issue. There has been  no offer to help us out with a free upgrade or compensation for no internet for so far three days and there is no urgency to fix the issue. Why do we need a filter after using the service for over two years. This is an extremely poor service especially for me and my wife who are dependant on the internet",0
Crap connection. Constantly drops off. The router is rubbish and the customer service is the worst in history. Stay away.,0
"Vodafone's broadband is inhumanly emphasised terms. You have to tell them 30 days before your termination needs and you will lose the £150 upfront fee if you don't return it within 14 days of purchasing their broadband, it's simply robbery. If you buy this broadband on the 1st of January and tell them on the 14th that you want to cancel, they will stop on the 14th of February and charge you 150 pounds of upfront cost and the cost from the 1st of January to the 14th of February. As a Vodafone customer for six years, unbelievable money-grabbing behaviour! Will not be buying anything from Vodafone in the future and will be telling everyone around me not to go for anything from Vodafone.On January 4th, 2025, I recently received a response from Vodafone, and I was taken aback by their statement about their ability to refund the upfront cost. On the 3rd of January, I enquired with Vodafone's online customer service, and your billing team firmly informed me that they could not refund the 150 pounds. Now, they are claiming that they can. Are you misleading your customers? I received your parcel on December 20, and I cancelled it on January 3. You have charged me over 200 pounds for the 14 days of borrowing time. I enquired with your customer service about the possibility of receiving a refund for the upfront costs if I returned the broadband to your branch on the 4th of January. However, your representative informed me they would not refund a single cent. Is the way you intend to profit from the customers?  I will go to the Vodafone branch to return the broadband in person and keep updating the details of the chargebacks.",0
"On 2 December 2024, I started a customer service call via Vodafone chat system. My current broadband commitment with them was ending. I shared the offers I received from other service providers with their evidence and told them that I wanted to continue with them if they could give the same offer. However, they asked about the phone tariffs used by me and my wife. I said that I was not interested in the telephone line and that I only wanted to get information about broadband. They said that they could not make the same offer.In that case, I asked them to take the necessary action, that I did not want to continue when my contract expired. In the meantime, when the process started to drag on, I told them that I was quite ill and asked them to speed up the process. However, the opposite happened.They told me that I had to submit a service termination request 30 days in advance, that there was an extra period in this case, and that a final invoice would be issued at a non-discounted price at the end of my commitment, which was quite high. They did not back down in any way.Then I realised in the e-mail I received that they had calculated the notice period as 32 days, not 30 days. I informed them about this, and they said that they included days such as bank holidays etc. I objected and they said they would correct it. I said OK.This whole process took 4 hours!I asked them to create file a complaint for this extremely bad customer service experience. They did, but no one ever got back to me.If it takes 4 hours to terminate an internet service even though I state that I am ill, I cannot see any other purpose here other than trying to make the customer regret the out of the service.I will take the matter to the official authorities.Non-FCA Frontline Complaint - 124527284Account number: 7074678879Chat Reference Number: 763192246090689716DATE/TIME: 2024-12-02 15:51:25 - 20:02:50",0

Staff on duty in Macclesfield on Saturday were rude and unhelpful - I went in to pick up a device that I had ordered in person in the shop two days earlier and because i did not take in id in the form of a credit charge i was not allowed to take the item - my daughter went in later to collect it and when she asked about the sim card and some technical advice was told to contact customer service,0

Sim card missing.Contacted Vodafone multiple times [on hold for excessive periods] trying to arrange sim card.Was told I could get an e-sim by one operator, but told otherwise by another. Was told Sim was in the post.Was advised there had also been a glitch and that the transfer of my number to Vodafone was held up and delayed [a ""porting order"" delay].In this time, my former provider issued me with emails notifying I was being cut off at my request on the same day.Called former provider and they informed me that Vodafone had instructed the cut off.Meanwhile, still no Sim.So - unable to take or make calls for around 48 hrs over festive period.Using wife's phone to contact Vodafone, I insisted that I needed a Sim.

"It’s the first time i became a customer with Vodafone this is the diabolical service I received from Vodafone.I bought a phone from Vodafone 34 days ago a refurbished prestige condition phoneWhen I Asked what’s wrong with the phone before agreeing to deal with it they said the customers who decide they don’t like the colour etc they send the phone back this is what they mean by prestine they assured me nothing wrongs with the phone.The phone is not charging it takes hours to charge.The screen suddenly goes blank and if someone rings me it’s still ringing, however can’t see who rings not showing up on screen because screen is blank.Screen goes blank.I phoned them they are not willing to do anything about the phone or exchange it for another, the only thing they are doing is taking it in for repair I don’t even know if it will work when they send it me back.Can you believe this happened with an I phone 14 pro max within 34 days.I’ve lost all trust.I also asked would I still have to pay a months bill as I’ve had no use of the phone they said I will have to pay it, not willing to budge making me feel like I’m the victim.They are making out like it’s my fault it seems like the customer is in fault after 34 days of no phone usage, faulty phoneI’m going crazy, I feel like crying, they have given me severe anxiety 😥I thought Vodafone is a well established company clearly not if they re crying over a phone which is a fault from their end not the customers.",0

"My experience with Vodafone has been extremely disappointing. Their mishandling of my case involving fraudulent device loan agreements shows a complete failure in safeguarding customer accounts and addressing issues fairly.1. Lack of Proper Security MeasuresVodafone allowed someone to create two loan agreements in my name without my consent. Changes to my email and address were made without any proper identity verification. When I flagged this, I was told that since these agreements were made online, no authorisation or signature was required. This is a glaring oversight in their processes and a failure to protect their customers.2. Inappropriate AdviceAfter reporting the issue, I informed Vodafone that the police explicitly advised me not to contact the individual responsible. Despite this, Vodafone repeatedly encouraged me to reach out to the person, leaving me in an even worse position than before. This was completely inappropriate and showed a lack of understanding about the risks involved.3. Unresolved Security VulnerabilitiesI raised concerns that the answers to the security questions on my account are not mine, yet Vodafone has failed to address this. This means my account remains vulnerable to further misuse, which is deeply concerning.4. Refusal to Take ResponsibilityRather than taking accountability for their failure to secure my account, Vodafone has shifted the burden onto me. Despite blacklisting the devices, they are still charging me for the loans and have advised me to take the matter to small claims court. This shows a lack of willingness to resolve the issue and disregard for their role in allowing this to happen.What Vodafone Should Have Done:Cancelled the fraudulent loan agreements immediately.Investigated and fixed the security vulnerabilities that allowed this to happen.Taken responsibility for their failure to verify the identity of the person creating the agreements.Final Thoughts:Vodafone’s handling of this situation has been unacceptable. Their failure to protect my account, their inadequate security processes, and their reluctance to take responsibility have caused unnecessary stress and financial burden.If you’re considering Vodafone, DON'T!—their lack of accountability and poor handling of security issues could leave you in a similar position.",0
I am with vodafone for long time.I wanna an upgrade to my phone contact to ipone pro max 16.So i called the customer service and tried to get deal. So we amost done with the deal.But before i sign the contract i find out they add something which they didn’t discuss with me. So it’s basically the put me phone deal for 36 months £35 months which cost me £1260 and sim deal for 24 months with £10.I am paying basically £45 for monthly..The worst part is they didn’t tell me phone contacts for 36 months..even they include my old phone trade in but still i have to pay £1260 for phone where same phone i can get from apple store for £1199. £1260 including my old phone trade in cost £170 if i buy with apple they trading with my old phone for £90 and cost is down £1109. Huge difference. My only concern is they never mentioned about 36 months contract. It is misleading and waste of time for me as i have to with them almost an hour.And finally I cancelled my contract..Its not acceptable at all.Thanks,0
"Absolutely rubbish, moved home ,supposed to supply Internet from 31st December, still waiting  spoken to 4 advisers,all rubbish can't even send an engineer to fix problem, but expect payment",0
"I'm currently with EE (just mobile and mobile internet) and because of the Wi-FI going down, now and again, I wanted to switch to broadband and just get a cheap pay monthly sim, to use home broadband off if I need it.I decided to start up with Vodafone. I ordered their broadband but wanted to upgrade, to a better service. They told me I had to cancel and start again. I hadn't been connected yet. So I cancelled and signed up for the new deal, they told me was available. Upon getting to the last page they said I couldn't get it, because it was full fibre and I was in a part fibre area. So, I had to cancel that and then apply again for the previous deal. The router arrived on the 28th December, for the cancelled 6th January install date. Then I got notified by DPD that I was getting another package on the 4th (today), which was for the new 9th January installation (the reapplied contract after the two previous cancellations). I received emails, from Vodafone, telling me that installation date was on the 6th and another on the 9th. I didn't know what was going on. I went to chat and waited ages for them to answer, because they were all too busy on other chats, in between my chat. They then told me I had come through to the wrong chat, even though they'd connected me to broadband. I was talking to Pay as You Go monthly. So I called them and got an exceptionally rude Indian man, no doubt in India, who couldn't give a rat's arse about my problem. To top it off, before I was connected to him, I had to press umpteen buttons to speak to him, being told my connection date was the 6th of January. He told me I had to installation date set up, before I hung up on him for his rudeness. In the middle of another call, waiting to be answered, DPD arrived and I just gave him both packages to be sent back to Vodafone. I told the assistant to cancel everything, at which he then told me that I had no installation date booked.What a waste of time. They didn't have a clue what was going on. I'm so glad I never entered into the 24 month contract. All that hassle and I wasn't even a customer yet. LOL",0
Customer service shoddy. Chief executive department is near useless. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Vodafone as a company is absolutely rubbish.I went with Vodafone as their broadband cost was cheaper than my existing supplier, Sky. I cancelled with Sky and joined up with Vodafone. The installation was booked on 27/12/24. The technician came and installed it, but there was no internet. The technician advised it needs activating at the pole, which will take 24 hrs. I get a call the following day (28/12/24) about how my internet is. I advise waiting for it to be activated. They checked their system and found that there is something wrong with the lighting at the pole that is connected to the internet, and it will be reviewed on 7/1/24. Bearing in mind that I work from home. The family is reliant on the internet,  I took a day off on 27/12/24 to get it installed; now they're saying it will be reviewed on 7/12/24, so I will be left without internet. I had to cancel with Vodafone on 28/12/24 and called Sky back up to put me back on, but they said as I cancelled with them, the line is with Vodafone. So unable to provide internet until they receive notification from Vodafone, which will take 24 hrs. Also, Sky has bumped up their price, which is costing more money going back to them. Furthermore, the agents at Vodafone don't know what tariff I am on; I signed up for £21 a month with a discount. After calling them up with all these issues, they were adamant I was on £28 a month. At the end I spoke to a UK agent who confirmed I am on a £21-a-month contract.Vodafone prices may be cheap, but if you're working from home or you need an internet connection to go smoothly, do not rely on them. They have caused stress, inconvenience, and I am worse off financially, or thanks to Vodafone. They are the worse company ever. I would not recommend them.",0
"I had a highly unsatisfactory experience with Vodafone's broadband service and cannot recommend it. During my one-year contract, the connection dropped at least ten times each evening. Upon completing the contract, I sought to cancel the service. However, when I contacted Vodafone via chat, I was informed that a 30-day notice was required, which I later discovered was incorrect for customers outside of the contract period.Subsequently, Vodafone proposed upgrading my connection to fiber optic, assuring improved stability and speed. I scheduled an engineer appointment, but the engineer failed to arrive on two occasions, causing me to waste two days waiting. Frustrated, I contacted Vodafone again to cancel all services and received confirmation that my account was closed. I also received an email offering compensation of £219 for the failed connection attempts, which I disregarded, believing my association with Vodafone had ended.Ten months later, I received emails indicating overdue payments of £28, followed by another stating a balance of £63. Upon contacting Vodafone via chat, I was advised to visit a store, where I was then directed to call customer service. It became evident that Vodafone had not canceled my account as confirmed; they had been charging me for ten months, depleting my credit, and only notified me when the credit was exhausted.Additionally, during a 40-minute call with customer service, the agent terminated the call, citing that I had been waiting too long.(I know the info from the customer service team when I went in the shop they looked into my account and I have read all their notes, disgusting)I strongly advise avoiding Vodafone and recommend verifying that any account cancellations are fully processed to prevent similar issues.",0
"I ordered a new home broadband service from Vodafone this week and spent an hour providing all the necessary information to a customer service agent. I signed up for a 24 month contract and was very happy with the package. My current provider BT then notified me that Vodafone were preparing to take over the service in a few weeks, so all seemed to be progressing well and I was impressed with Vodafone. However, the following day I got an unexpected email from Vodafone saying my order was cancelled and that I would need to ring them in 4 days time to raise a new order again. I initially thought it was a scam. I contacted Vodafone to find out what was happening and to try and reinstate the order. After using their chat service I was passed through 5 different teams for over an hour trying to get clarity on what had happened. They confirmed the order was cancelled but could not help me or explain why. They told me I had cancelled it but I hadn’t. When I told them it was clearly a mistake and that I still wanted to go ahead and requested that they simply reinstate my order, they told me I couldn’t and that I would have to start all over again. Obviously I don’t want to do this - partly as I don’t have the time and also for fear of having the next order cancelled as well. So, after many hours trying to transfer my broadband service to Vodafone I actually don’t have anything to show for it other than a cancelled contract and a notification from BT that they are going to end my current service in a few weeks time. I can’t tell you how stressful this experience has been and how frustrating it has been to try your very best to become a customer of Vodafone. Their customer service teams really don’t seem to have the information or systems needed to support them. My final request to Vodafone was for someone to call me to help me reinstate the order. Amazingly they told me they couldn’t call me. I’m now looking at alternative providers in the hope they can do better.",0
Very expensive plus couldn’t provide full fibre. Gone elsewhere for half the price and 6 times faster speed.,0
"One of the Worst Broadband ServicesI had one of the worst experiences with Vodafone while purchasing their broadband service. Initially, they offered a huge discount in the form of gift cards, which seemed appealing, but I later realized the issues hidden behind their service.After installation, I found that the WiFi range was insufficient for my home. I contacted Vodafone customer service, requesting a solution either to fix the issue or send me a WiFi booster (one or two, depending on the need). Instead of resolving the problem, they insisted I upgrade my contract to a more expensive plan to get a booster. All I asked for was a WiFi extender, not free broadband for life!The situation worsened when a customer advisor promised to call me back on December 26, 2024, to arrange a return. Not only did she fail to keep her promise, but she was also extremely unprofessional during the call. I could hear a house party in the background, with kids crying and noise throughout. If you can’t fulfill a promise, don’t mislead customers it adds unnecessary stress. Why couldn’t Vodafone use the voucher credit they offered as part of the promotion to send a WiFi extender or their so-called booster? It’s frustrating that they push customers to upgrade their contracts instead of using the existing credit to address basic service issues. This would have been a fair and logical solution, considering I only needed a simple device to fix the poor WiFi range not a costly new plan.”My biggest concern was the cooling-off period. If I didn’t return the equipment on time, I would have been stuck in their contract. Thankfully, I contacted Vodafone again around 5:30 PM (UK time) and spoke to a representative named Bumba. He was professional, helpful, and explained everything clearly. I truly appreciated his assistance and told him I’d leave a review to highlight the issues and commend his support.Now, Vodafone has sent me an email stating that I need to pay for a full month’s service, even though I only used it for six days and canceled well within the cooling-off period. According to the Consumer Rights Act, this charge seems completely unjustified.",0
"Moved house and moved the vodaphone broadband over to my new house, they changed my contract without my permission and after hours of phone calls for them to admit fault and put my contract back to original contract, constant lying, had enough and leaving them finally , paid up to the end of the month and now suddenly they are switching my internet off and on even though there’s 20 days before I leave ,stay well clear , go with sky or utility warehouse",0
I went into the store and was standing there for a good 10 mins whilst the sales assistant watched me obviously aware that I needed help eventually he asked me what I needed help with I said I'm interested in this pay as you go phone he said we don't have any of the pay as you go phones without even checking to see why put about 20 pay as you go phones on display if your out of stock and don't have them  it's a waste of time for the customer it's not rocket science to remove them from display if there not in stock available for sale.,0

"The main complaint I have with Vodafone UK is their poor service, specifically regarding buffering and latency issues. After months of frustration, I bought a third-party router (TP-Link Deco) which finally resolved the issues, proving that the fault was with the router provided by Vodafone. Despite this, Vodafone refused to send a replacement router or send someone to test the equipment. Their boosters and routers are of very poor quality, and I strongly recommend avoiding them. Instead, invest in a reliable router like TP-Link Deco or Eero and use the PPPoE account provided by Vodafone rather than their subpar devices.From the outset, Vodafone’s service has been appalling. When I first signed up, they never bothered to send anyone to properly set up the connection. Aside from the Openreach engineer installing the fibre, I had to do everything else myself. Despite reporting multiple issues, Vodafone repeatedly came up with different excuses for the poor service. At various times, they blamed congestion, my house, the number of devices I was using, or even the fact that I tested the internet on iPhones rather than Android devices. I was told to make video calls to show the cable I was using—even though I was using a high-quality Cat 8 cable.Despite all of this, no one from Vodafone ever came to my address to properly investigate the issue. Instead, I was left dealing with a support team that appeared to lack any knowledge of broadband or technical troubleshooting. I’ve had to waste hours on the phone, often during the day when I’m at work, and was still left with no resolution.Even after I reported the case to CISAS, Vodafone continued to be inconsistent. They emailed me stating I would not have to pay a termination fee, yet every time I tried to cancel, they insisted I would be charged £70 for the remaining three months. This lack of accountability is unacceptable.To make matters worse, when I asked for email responses instead of phone calls, their standard reply was to offer another 24-month contract, with no credit or reimbursement for the time I paid for non-functional devices.For anyone considering Vodafone broadband, I strongly advise against it. If you’re looking for a reliable provider, check out Zen, Cuckoo, or Utility Warehouse, and focus on Openreach providers with better reviews. Avoid Vodafone’s devices entirely—use your own router with a PPPoE account, which is easy to set up and far more reliable.Additional Advice: If you’re considering Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, make sure you have the latest devices in your home (e.g., iPhone 16, the latest MacBook, or top-tier Lenovo laptops) to fully utilise these technologies. Otherwise, they’re not worth it.To Vodafone: Please do not respond with a generic “contact us to discuss” reply. Every time I’ve contacted you, I’ve been stonewalled, ignored, or offered unhelpful solutions. Your customer service is the worst I’ve ever experienced.Update 13.01.25: Vodafone reached an agreement, and I received a credit as compensation. A new contract has been established without any additional boosters, offering a favourable monthly rate.",0
"In essence, they incorrectly charged me, took my money and then said they couldn't do anything to put it right. However, let me take you on a journey of poor customer service:I was billed mid-December for a broadband service that was not even due to be connected until 7 January. I contacted their customer service rep who told me it was a technical error, it would be resolved without me doing any more and they definitely would not take my money.They took my money.I logged on to my account and tried to connect to customer service. It needed to verify who I was (despite me having logged in) and offered to send a verification code. It then refused to send a verification code as I didn't have a Vodfone mobile. Instead I had to enter my account id and password again.I was then through to the AI chatbot - artificial certainly, intelligent not at all. It refused to accept this was a problem it could not resolve and we ended up going round in circles with the dunce bot sending me a copy of the bill several times and insisting it could explain it. In the end, I explicitly asked to be connected with a real person. This is did after a few more inane questions to get me to the ""right"" person.I explained the problem to the real person. Who asked me to confirm that I had no broadband from them. A point they should have known and eventually went on to accept.This took an enormous length of time as the real person replied very slowly (presumably juggling to many enquiries at once). Speed of response was so slow that the dunce bot kept interjecting with threats to terminate the conversation, even though it was the rep that was failing to respond.The rep tried to excuse the charge on the basis that I was paying for a landline connection. For a host of different reasons, this was nonsense. So they lied about not taking the money and then lied about the reason for the charge.Finally, it was acknowledged the bill had been issued in error. I thought light could be seen at the end of the tunnel. However, even though the bill should not have been issued and the money should not have been taken, the rep said they could do nothing about it. They had no power to issue a credit note against the bill or to return my money! This from the person the dunce bot had connected me to because of an ability to resolve billing issues.After fruitless and slow further discussion which just served to make me angry, I asked to be connected to a supervisor/manager. The rep said there was no point as the supervisor had the same powers an would just say the same thing!I asked if there was a formal complaints procedure/contact. This question was not answered.I decided to abandon the call and see, for the first time in my life, whether the direct debit guarantee scheme would offer an avenue to get my money back.I was offered an email with a transcript of the call. I thought this might be useful so accepted. It asked for my email yet again. Unsurprisingly the the transcript was never sent (yes, I checked junk.)In the unlikely event anyone reads this far, sorry for the long review; just needed to get it off my chest.UPDATE: Found their formal complaints procedure. It was impressively efficient and sorted everything out very quickly. It is a shame it had to come to that.",0

"Absolute rubbish, now have no WiFi, TV or landline phone, moved over from sky, what a mistake, router on constant flashing red, contacted Vodafone, said it's activated, went through all set up, reset etc, still nothing, now said will take up to midnight to activate even though they said its activated, total pile of bull, it did come on for about 10 seconds, then went back off, said router configuration was wrong, so they reset it, again reset router, checked cables etc, all correctly connected, asked if I could do a video call of router set up & said they would send a link, said yes, law & behold no link sent, said there was a problem with sending a link, total rubbish, they need to get there fingers out, service absolutely atrocious, tried also to sign up to the Vodafone app, guess what? Can't even do that, as soon as I try to register it locks me out, tried that god knows how many times!!!",0
"Customer service has to be the worst I've ever experienced, installation of our new customer broadband was only half completed as cherry picker was needed to connect line from house to pole as the pole is labelled unsafe to climb, I've been in touch with them on numerous occasions via Facebook messenger with a different customer service person every time, since the install date of 6/12/24 and still have not been given a date as to when it's going to be completed, all I get is review dates that come and go without anything new to report or any action taken to get a date to complete from Openreach, have raised an official complaint with them too which they automatically closed without any solution given apart from £10 good will gesture into my account that I can't yet access??, appalling way to treat a new customer, I'm going to give it a few more weeks and if not installed I'm going to cancel as they have failed to honour their side of the contract !!Vodafone, have tried the link in your reply previously and the bot Tobi is absolutely useless !!Any people who are thinking about joining Vodafone just read the reviews and make your own minds up....",0
"I visited your Harrow store on December 11, 2024, to port my number from another network and take advantage of an online offer that I found. I was assisted by Store Manager Hafsa, and the situation has since been plagued by mistakes, delays, and poor communication.Chronology of Events:1. Initial Porting Error & Promise of £75 Offer:On December 11, 2024, I went to the Harrow Vodafone store to port my number and purchase a broadband package. While attempting the porting process, Store Manager Hafsa made an error with the phone numbers. She assured me that the issue would be resolved within 24-48 hours and also confirmed that I would receive a £75 offer on my account.2. Service Disruption:Despite this promise, after 3 days, the issue persisted. I contacted Hafsa again, and she informed me that it would take another 48 hours to resolve. During this time, my temporary Vodafone SIM stopped working as of December 12, and I was left without service. I continued using my old SIM for two more days, but it, too, was deactivated, leaving me without network or internet access for over 48 hours.3. Further Delays & Inadequate Solutions:I returned to the Vodafone store, where I was provided with another temporary SIM, with added minutes and 15GB of data and its finished within some days and I recharged my self .However, the problem remained unresolved, and I was repeatedly told by customer service to wait another 48 hours for activation.4. Unclear Communication & Rude Behavior:I requested a callback from a manager, and a representative claimed to be a manager, promising a resolution in another 24-48 hours. Unfortunately, nothing happened. I called customer service again, and this time, I was transferred to the technical department, where I was subjected to rude behavior and a repetitive response to “wait another 48 hours.”5. Transfer Confirmation from Previous Provider & PAC Code Issues:After speaking with my previous network provider, I was informed that the porting process had already been completed. I then requested either my Vodafone SIM to be activated or for a PAC code to be issued. However, Vodafone customer care informed me that they were unable to issue a PAC code due to unspecified reasons.6. Incorrect Information Regarding £75 Offer:On December 24, 2024, I spoke with Hafsa again, and during this call, she informed me that the £75 offer I was promised was not applicable to me and was only for existing customers. This contradicts the email confirmation I received on December 11, which clearly outlined the offer. I find this inconsistency and lack of accountability deeply frustrating.Current Status:As of December 26, 2024, my original phone number (which I have been using for the past four years) is still not activated, and I am unable to use my Vodafone account or services. This ongoing issue has caused severe disruption to my personal and professional life, including affecting my work, communication with family and friends, and overall connectivity.Resolution ASAP ,I will escalate the issue to Ofcom and other relevant authorities.",0
My pac has not yet come and my mobile data,0
"They offered broadband and landline. The broadband is fine but the landline doesn’t work. After a number of iterations the latest is for the matter to be referred to another department. I’ve received a text to say the broadband is fine, which it always was. There was no mention of the landline which still doesn’t work. My 92 year old father in law relies on the landline to call us if he has a problem so this is a really serious matter.",0
I put in £40 for unlimited data package but the can't supply it now they have my money and I am going too be taking them to small claims court to get my money back they are worst phone company I have ever seen I was told to give it 24hrs for the plan to take the money and still nothing,0
"Vodaphone 500 mb deal. Day 1 203mbps, 5th day 37.2! OK 'settling in period' but two concurrent days, below 40 no way! I then wasted an hour of my life with their hapless Tobi Chatbox rubbish talking to the Pacific ring.Almost beaten by their complete inertia, as a last shot, I rung Cusomer Service after a treasure hunt online to access the number!Another waste of time, I could hardly understand what the woman was saying, little remedy that the content had to my situation. Definitely from a script, she was completely absorbed about identity etc.Told them I would quit within the 14 day cooling period from service if the speed didn't improve. After the best part of two hours of this friction my download shot back up to 200+. A short lived fix though, for this morning and all day 29 .4! Got onto my old provider TalkTalk, who took over the whole thing very competently and I go live 2/1/25 with them with an Amazon 6e mesh router. What an utter waste of advertising and all thats involved with gaining a customer in a very competitive and active market. Shocking performance, I'd have fired the lot if they'd ever worked for me! Instead this experience will be hidden, buried in a bland world of Corporate anarchy and disinterest.OK £8 a month more with TT and only 150mbps top download, but at 80 years of age my heart doesn't want any more trips down Vodaphone's 'Stroke Road' to nowhere. Service and competence has a value and living for two years dreading having to contact the supplier has a price and one I'm pleased to pay!",0
Great service at carphone warehouse but the problems started once setting up.Terrible reception which I thought was guaranteed but Im now advised that as the issue is with the construction of my house I’m stuck paying for a phone that I can’t use in my own home.I will refer to Ofgem but for now I’m having to go back to EE so beware of these false promises relating to network coverage .I was also given an incorrect telephone number ( by text) to ring to remove my voicemail.I tried ringing unsuccessfully from various locations ( as it doesn’t work at home ) only to find out it was a typo so another waste of hours of my life I won’t get back!UPDATEThank you for your response .I did both of your suggestions!1210 does not work as I constantly get a call failed as I can’t phone from home.I cannot completely turn off the voicemail and am told it could take 6 months to delete messages on there already.( I’ve been back to Carphone Warehouse and they cannot do it either) .I did use your tool to check coverage and it says excellent coverage indoors and outdoors so your information is inaccurate and a  waste of time just like your network !,0
"Customer Care is shocking, awful experience with them after cancelling broadband,  they try to send you more bills, unnecessary hassle off them, charge you £5 when you've cancelled direct debit but when they go on to make mistakes all you get is the famous sorry.0 out of 10Useless company",0
Absolutely disgusting. Got an iPhone 5 which I changed my mind on. I returned it and now 4 months later they have sent my details to a debt collecting company saying I owe £40 for that phone . I’ve rang them so many times and each time they say I owe nothing. Why can’t they just sort this out. It’s the worse phone company ever. Would not recommend.,0
"I recently went on a trip to Saudi Arabia found out I had wracked up roaming charge. I have four accounts with Vodafone, when I disputed these roaming charges as I have a spend cap of 0 on all my 4 accounts, I came across the rudest two people in the form of Abhisheikh and Kratika from web chat who flat out refused to raise an official complaint for me. I will be taking all my 4 accounts from Vodafone as soon as possible. Stay clear from Vodafone they are crooks. They kept me waiting for an hour on Xmas eve wasted my time",0
"Vodaphone offered us an upgrade on our broadband on 18/12/2024. We were told this would be done on 19/12/2024, we were not informed that any issues would occur. We have not had internet since! After many phone calls and getting told different issues we still have no connection. We have now been told to wait another 48 hours even after being told this would guaranteed be sorted by yesterday and to not worry. So that’s Christmas with no broadband which means the presents we have got the children will not be able to be used, we will not be able to have music or watch any TV as this is all done through our broadband.I have been a loyal customer for years and I’m utterly disgusted that this is not being sorted and no one at vodaphone seems to care about this. Would not recommending vodaphone to anyone going forward.",0

AVOID! I’ve had broadband for 6 months and I’ve spent over 13 hours on the phone to them as the internet drops out several times every single day!!I’ve contacted them 13 times since October. Every time they run through the same process and nothing has changed. They always say they will call back but they never do!!I tried to make a complaint on the phone and when I’ve called back today apparently the complaint wasn’t even submitted their end.They’ve tried to say I need to pay more even though I’m on one of the top packages!  They’ve refused to refund days I’ve not even had internet. They won’t close my contract without me paying!!I think I have been very patient trying to resolve this during the 13 hours spent on the phone to them. Now I’m trapped paying for broadband that doesn’t even work!!,0

"My Experience with VodafoneI want to share my experience with Vodafone, a company that has caused me significant frustration, financial loss, and emotional distress. What started as a simple request to switch my mobile number turned into a nightmare of fraudulent practices, poor customer service, and unauthorized charges.On 25 November 2024, I contacted Vodafone to transfer my mobile number from my previous provider, EE, to their network. I provided the necessary PAC code and was assured that my number would be successfully transferred by the evening. However, later that day, my phone lost signal entirely, and my number was not switched as promised.When I contacted Vodafone to resolve the issue, I was shocked to be told that I had another contract associated with Carphone Warehouse. This was completely untrue—I have never had any connection with Carphone Warehouse. Despite my insistence that this was a mistake, Vodafone failed to resolve the problem.Instead of fixing the issue, Vodafone created a second contract in my name without my consent. This contract was unauthorized, fraudulent, and completely unnecessary. As a result, my service was disrupted for days, leaving me without access to my mobile number, which severely impacted my personal and professional life.The situation worsened when Vodafone deducted £39.67 from my bank account, far exceeding my agreed monthly contract payment of £17. This charge was unauthorized and a clear indication that Vodafone deliberately created this second contract to extract more money from me.Despite numerous calls and complaints to Vodafone, their responses were dismissive and inadequate. They initially offered me a compensation of £10, which was later increased to £245. However, this does not even begin to cover the financial harm, inconvenience, and emotional stress their actions have caused me.This entire ordeal has been nothing short of a nightmare. Vodafone’s actions, including creating an unauthorized contract, disconnecting my service, and withdrawing funds without my consent, are fraudulent and unethical. They have shown no accountability, no genuine effort to resolve the issue, and no respect for my rights as a customer.I have decided to take legal action against Vodafone to hold them accountable for their actions. This includes filing a claim in court to demand the immediate cancellation of the unauthorized contract, a full refund of all unauthorized charges, and compensation for the harm caused. Additionally, I plan to share my story publicly so that others are aware of Vodafone’s unethical practices.This experience has shown me that Vodafone cannot be trusted as a service provider. Their actions have caused me unnecessary stress, financial loss, and wasted time. I urge others to think carefully before choosing Vodafone, as no customer should have to go through what I have endured.",0
"Poor and pathetic services in Maidenhead area. Anyone living near maidenhead, don’t even think of getting the services.No internet at all and every time you call them they will say the maintenance work is going and there is no ETA for this.Absolutely gutted.",0
Awful internet coverage. Two days this week no internet at all. Vodafones response there are many factors that affect this. But this wasn't just for a short period of time they are offering no service at all. Dealing with customer service is painful as they really aren't very helpful and don't all adopt the same practice. Had many different providers over the years and Vodafone has been the worst. If you don't want to risk pulling your hair out in frustration at an internet company can't provide the one service your paying for avoid!!! I will expect the usual standard response to a review they always provide. Please phone us do we can help. Well after hours of trying to get anywhere with Vodafone I refuse to spend anymore time dealing with them. I get notifications saying I asked to change things I haven't. Shambles of a company.,0
"Network drops out several times a week, custom care is shocking, they tell you what you want to hear just to get you off the phone or simply hang up. I've spent 6 hour on the phone over the last couple of weeks to them and still no further forward. I CANT WAIT TILL MY CONTRACT IS OVER!!!!🤬🤬",0
Shit company charged me more every month carnt out a screen shot in 4 some reason wonder why that be,0

Just spent 20 minutes going in circles around the Vodafone 191 automated system trying to speak to a human and it was impossible.I will be cancelling my contract tomorrow. Absolutely disgusting lack of service.,0
"Vodafone are charging me a whole month line rental for a period where I am no longer a customer.  Customer representative told me I should pay a false bill, so I can claim a refund later. Makes absolutely no sense at all. In any other sense, this is theft (demanding money for a service that you will not be providing)Also, access via the web front end hardly ever works (Safari). The chat function falls over frequently - the desire for feedback at the end of the chat also means that you cannot save the transcript. Access to information is difficult generally, for example nowhere can I find the date that I ported my number away to a new provider. The two years I was with them, the signal was also very patchy as well.Update 30/12- reduced to one star. They are now charging me a £5 late payment fee, even though I am out of contract with them!. in other words realising their mistake (charging me line rental for a period after my contract had ended) they have send me a revised final bill of £zero with a late payment fee of £5. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and really adds weight my accusation of this company being thieves (demanding money for a service that they are not providing, and then fining me a further £5 plus VAT, for not paying for a service that they are not providing). Honestly, you couldn't make this up.(and yes, I have spoken to your social media team. I have been messaging them for one hour, and so far have got as far as the basic questions).",0
This happens to a lot of users so i had cancelled my membership with them and after that cancellation they had charge me two months after until i said something . This has happend to my partner aswell and they said that they didn’t know why it kept charging him money after he cancelled the contract with feb and charged him in march and April . Before going with Vodafone just be prepared for when they charge you after you cancel your contract with them.,0
I'm still awaiting a response to my complaint and the broadband team to phone me! It's getting beyond a joke now!,0
"Signed up and was given an installation date - nearly 2 weeks later it was finally put in by a sub contractor. Only the phone upstairs works and they can’t fix it.Vodafone never answer the phone.

"Ordered 3 phones for Christmas to be delivered to a relative to hide. Vodafone a) got address wrong despite being given correct one, b) tried to deliver to previous address when told I had moved and had correct current address, c) delivered only 2 phones. I have spent in excess of 4 hours today trying to get this sorted. None of their staff have English as their first language so can't understand what they are being told, do not read previous contact information, tell complete lies ie. The phone was delivered, the phone was cancelled, the phone was redirected all on one call. 4 separate complaints raised and not one call back from manager as requested numerous times. Appalling customer service. Did offer to deliver on 25th December when I had to inform him that is Christmas day in our country! Extremely disappointed and unbelievably unhelpful staff.",0
Our interest has been down for two weeks now since storm Darragh. We spoke several times to a lady at customer services who assured us everything would be up and running within a week and we’d be compensated for our hardship.The engineer called today and fixed the problem but he said the router needed replacing as the signal wasn’t stable and it shouldn’t be like that. Vodafone have just messaged to congratulate themselves for fixing the problem and when we asked about compensation we’d get £9.76 for a reduced timeframe. About a week. We’re not getting a new router either. Contract runs out in March so they know where they can shove the renewal!,0
"I can’t make or receive phone calls from my house due to poor Vodafone service. Ironically, after chatting online to Vodafone they told me to call them to sort this issue which is hard when I have zero signal at home. I’m eight months pregnant and have had issues with the hospital not being able to ring me. Vodafone insists the network coverage is good at my address but I know it’s not. Case in point when I called to discuss this issue the call immediately cut out. My husband is on O2 and has signal at home.I asked about leaving Vodafone and was told I could pay out the remainder of my contract. Why should I pay anything to leave as I’m currently paying for services I’m not receiving!",0
Customer service is gone for good...I am with Vodafone since 2001 as a personal customer and also since 2015 as a business cutomer. The customer service currently is the worst that I experienced in all these years. I will move away once the contract finishes.,0
"The quality of the broadband is good, but the app provides false information about payments and bills aren't showing details about missed payment.I must been missed one payment for them and than strange things happened:Next month I tried to pay for the current bill but had no idea about missed payment (they never informed me about it) there was some super strange glitch:first payment had returned the message unsuccessful so I tried to pay again and it was successful. Than when I have checked with their app it shown double amount taken. I checked the previous month and it says that successful payment via DD. So I have contacted them via chat: first thing no4 PIN nor memorable word have been working, after unsuccessful attempts to pass so many security questions my chat has been disconnected. After putting again in the PIN and memorable word via their app I have started new chat this time I passed the security with no problems, then I started the dispute about the double payment and it was a terrible experience: the agent said that it is shown on the bill that I paid for the both missed payment and current month - it was a rude lie - no such information has been given on the bill only current month and the late fee has been shown but overall sum has been doubled. After 2 hours of me trying to explain what is wrong I have checked my account statement from the bank and indeed there was no transfer of DD to Vodafone for missed month, but also there was no reversal information which is always provided if the DD is unsuccessful. For me it is very strange that the app is showing that I paid for the broadband and also makes me suspicious that they have no provided any information that payment has been missed also very strange that it is not detailed on the bill for what they charged me double amount plus late fee and at the end the strange glitch occurred during payment.1 I was never informed about missed payment2 there is no evidence in the app (it's shows paid via DD3 even during this payment wasn't any information about missed payment and that I paying for it4 on the bill is no information about the missed payment - the final sum doesn't add upI don't know what to think about that experience it makes me starting to believe in the conspiracy theoriesAlso it's extremely hard to communicate with agent via chat the window don't scroll automatically to the latest messages by me or by agent you have to do it manually, after couple seconds of inactivity it says: ""I'll give it three more minutes before I end this chat session"" and it is very stressful to log into the bank and check the account within 3 minutes.Also it's really strange that when I have logged into my banking app it downloaded the statement from year before and it is usually showing the latest statements on the top.As well they said that theirs system does not allows them for offer any form of reimbursement for the hassles and poor quality app.Everything what I have experienced makes me believe that all reality we experiencing is in the fact matrix I mean that data can change in the split of the moment in one moment I have a statement which is shown payment made but after sending the screenshot to agent it turns out to be from the year ago.I don't want to make any accusations but it's they provide the transport of the data to your device who knows if it is not possible to change the realms at least on the digital level.",0
"Tried to call to notify change of address, but office was closed so changed online. 6 weeks later, received a bill in excess of £154 - cancellation fee. Explained the situation with moving house and my intention to arrange reconnection at new property, but told 'because I made address change on line and didn't call to order new connection' the charge stands. Only with them 1 month, was preparing to switch 3 mobile accounts from o2 to Vodafone as well, but not now. Good riddance",0
Took out fibre broadband on 4 September 24 it is much better than my last broadband but unfortunately my last broadband was not cancelled phoned Vodafone when I realised I was still paying my last broadband provider I asked why it was not cancelled they said they did not do that then so I must of dreamed this because they said I was not told this although I received many messages about dates of installation etc and feel sure I asked about cancellation of old service and told it would be cancelled for me so I now have to fill in a form although been told won’t do much good being a pensioner I feel sick that I have had to pay for 2 broadband services since 4 September trying now to cancel old broadband but unfortunately can’t seem to do this will review them next,0
"We recently switched after a long time (3+ years) due to probably the worst customer service I’ve had.We moved home and with us our Broadband, but the activation date was delayed, initially by a month (fibre needed installing by open reach). That’s fair, I rang Vodafone and asked for a temporary solution as I work from home and was spending an amount of money on data (there’s a daily compensation but that doesn’t cover it). After several calls and rounds of complaints (this seems by design) they finally agreed to a temporary solution: a WiFi dongle, who would’ve thought!? They also kindly provided with a 4GB SIM card.Nearly a month and a half later the open reach team came and did the job, my broadband could be activated.Next thing I know I was being charged for the WiFi dongle, and the 4GB sim card (which I didn’t use) a non-trivial amount of money (nearly £100 in total).Given how much hassle it was to obtain a temporary solution for such a long delay in service, and they charged me for it, I’m waving goodbye to Vodafone on all accounts.",0
I am really hating on this company. I joined using the one switch process in August. They didn't cancel my old account and I have paid for both for 4 months. I called to complain and it's a a 5 minute process before you speak to someone - I finally got through and they put the phone down on me.Terrible experience so far.,0
"""I absolutely hate Vodafone. Their customer service is a nightmare – endless waits, no resolutions, and being passed from one department to another. Their billing is a mess with hidden charges and errors they never take responsibility for. The network coverage is terrible, with constant dropped calls and slow data even in cities. Their promises about 5G are a joke. Avoid Vodafone at all costs!""",0
"So I'm in quite a shocking experience with this lot. No broadband connection a month in, multiple calls and chats with various departments asking for my inside leg measurements (well, my year of birth, PIN number, account number, name). They seem unable to fix a basic router malfunction issue which could be easily fixed by sending out a new £20 router. Weird, distressing, odd, weird. I will update.",0
"Worst phone company and broadband I've ever had. Paying for two contracts when I clearly cancelled June 2024, no refund and then mentioned I should be charged £180 cancellation fee. No offer for refund. So finally get the new sim of the upgraded contract, takes 18 days to arrive and now doesn't work, because they said it was ""lost"" in the post and will be sent a new one. Moved into our home may 2024, broadband didn't work for 6 weeks. Now I'm chained to them for another two years. Quite frankly can't wait to leave.",0
Awaiting the essential broadband team to contact me!,0
"First we started by calling Vodafone, completely useless. With the phone call, in the end all they had to say was that we apparently didn't buy the phone from them (we did) and that we should go to the shop (wow, very helful thanks.) So that was a complete waste of time.I went with my Nan today because her phone started to turn off. She got the phone around last year, for a phone battery to seemingly start to fail a year after purchase is disgusting. The individuals in the store in Wigan provided no assistance, other than checking the battery percentage. Before giving the phone to them I had re-seated the battery and checked it. We were told that nothing can be done because it was purchased via pay as you go; my 80 year old disabled nan was stuck with a phone that may be starting to fail. It's honestly disgusting, is this the treatment you think she deserves? Is this what she pays you for? Wasted money on the car park too.From this bad, time-wasting, neglectful experience I can't say I'll ever recommend Vodafone to anyone again, and this was -after- I had switched her over to Vodafone. Seems that was a mistake eh?If the battery does end up failing and I have to buy a new one for her or figure something out, I can say that I am more useful than your company that specialise in this. For shame.Heed this warning if you buy your phone on pay as you go with them. This is how they treat their paying customers.",0
"Really dissapointed with the speed, and also with the customer support. I have cancelled my contract but Vodafone does not cooperate with the new broadband supplier to do the switch.",0
"One of the reasons I've stayed with Vodafone for so long is the rewards especially the Friday ones, however since renewing my contract haven't received anything for 9 weeks.  Chatted with Vodafone several times about this and constantly get fobbed off with nonsense.  I have another contract and broadband that I will be cancelling shortly.",0
"Can NOT wait for my contract to be over. Lied about me keeping my number, 0 coverage in my area which they should have known about, stuck to pay another couple hundred quid until the contract ends or I pay extra to end it early. 0 help from customer support except messing around with settings that never help or work. Save your time and money and go through any single other network provider.",0
"Ordered a phone on the 6th of December as a Christmas present to be delivered to the store, and the email said it would be in the store in two days, Still waiting for it to be delivered, I have rung Vodafone multiple times to no avail keep getting told should be with them in within five days. I have never had a problem with an order like this before I am upset and stressed about the whole thing",0
"Recently joined Vodafone UK and opted for the 300 international minutes add on for my landline.Two things I have experienced1. Terminates calls after 30 minutes2. not able to get a balance either from my web account or app.The only way is to spend up to 25 minutes on the phone or the same time on their chat service.I've even been to the local Vodafone shop and even they cannot help.So why is it so difficult for Vodafone to provide this information as I don't want to exceed my monthly allowance and incur premium charges.My previous provider gave this information via their app in real time.------------------------------------If you require any assistance, pop us over a message via Facebook: or Instagram:Thanks, Vodafone Social Media Team----------------------------------------Typical Social Media Team response -  not everyone uses Facebook or Instagram -  so why can you not respond to the questions above so others can see the reply.

"Booked a new broadband installation with Vodafone. The sign-up process ran smoothly, and plenty of information was shared before the installation date this Monday. I still have my previous contract with another provider running for another week. I was informed that Vodafone could not cancel my other contract with the other provider, which is ok because I cancelled it myself. I ensured with Vodafone's customer service in advance that this would not cause any issues with my new connection. I was reassured that I would get a brand new, separate line installed so there would not be any problem. On Monday, when the Openreach engineer started with the installation, he decided to cut the old line and install the new line, as I should be connected to my new provider within two hours. The new line is now installed, and the new ONT box is in perfect working order. However, the Power Hub refuses to connect to the newly installed ONT box. I escalated the issue to Vodafone's customer support on Monday and was asked to be patient as it could take up to midnight for the new connection to be established. However, whilst I called, they also tried two hard resets of the Power Hub, which had no success, so all I could do was wait for the magic to happen overnight. The following day, the Power Hub was still flashing red, and no connection occurred. Customer support contacted me to double-check if everything was up and running by now. I had to deny it. They tried another hard reset and then asked me to send in several photos of my setup. I would be contacted within hours by the specialist team, and if they could not solve the issue, a technical engineer would be appointed for a home visit. Nothing happened. I gave them another call. They were still waiting for the photos to be uploaded/attached to the ticket this could take another 16 hours as these photos are usually only uploaded around 9 am every day... (WHAT?) The next day, nothing happened, although I was supposed to get a follow-up call between 1 and 3 pm. Called at 3 pm, and still no photos, if I could send them again. Did so, but this time, I insisted on staying on the call until I received confirmation that the images were attached to the ticket. This happened, and I was told the specialist team would now be in touch within 4 hours. After 2 hours, att 6 pm last night, I got a text from the specialist team that an internal team would not look into my fault and that it could take until today for an update to be provided. The customer support employee from last night promised me a call this morning, which unfortunately did not happen. Instead, I got my first bill claiming money for the service that is supposedly been running smoothly since Monday and although I had been promised that I would only be charged from when the connection is succesfully established and I would be entitled to compensation as well. So, I had to call myself at noon to challenge the bill and now learn that the internal team had now promised ""an update"" on the case on the next day. So, since Monday, I am without any internet connection at home and I can no longer believe that anyone is actually really trying hard to solve the issue, instead of having two separate working lines with two different providers, I now have zero working lines and feel utterly neglected and only promised loose, non-binding updates. Where is the service technician at my place that was promised to me on Tuesday? To avoid similar issues, at this stage, I can only recommend avoiding this company by any means.",0
Vodafone Business - internet not working properly and no landline for 3 months.I choose Vodafone to provide internet and landline for my commercial premises and from the beginning we have had on/off internet and no landline at all. This is obviously a disaster for a business owner and I now regret choosing Vodafone.We opened in early October and I have been told our issues will not be resolved end of Jan/Early February. Finger's crossed that is true. I was told it wasn't Vodafone's fault but that it is an issue with the Openreach - as if that is my problem.What Vodafone have been good at is phoning me regularly to telling me nothing different than what they told me previously - that my case is escalated as a priority. Ever phone call ends with a request to fill in a survey for them.,0
"Received my router, noticed that the cable didn’t fit. Rang and asked for an adapter, was told that the adapter would be sent before my activation date. Activation date is today and no adapter received, spoke to Vodafone and was told there was never an order raised. Have to sit and wait now for another week to wait for a bloody adapter. New customer, wish I could just cancel. Why not send an adapter in the box anyway for people who might need it.",0
"Horrible irresponsible service. I was asked be home yesterday as the renewed contract phone will be delivered. However, no phone or a call. Now I’m online for the past hour with customer service who are unable to locate any record! My account number 7065712806",0
"I went on-line on Saturday 14th December 24 to request the deal for the Apple iPhone 13 128 GB which was due to end at midnight on the 19th December. The girl I dealt with appeared very efficient and processed my order sending through my contract to my email address which I needed to sign within 72 hrs. When I went to sign the contract the following day that was when my nightmare started! My husband noticed they had put the wrong address on the contract and my sort code was also incorrect. When I made contact with the team the following day they said they could amend the incorrect details but when I requested the new contract they said they couldn't amend the contract as they would need to cancel the order and start again. I was not happy to sign a contract on-line which was incorrect and after a long time trying to explain this said they would have to cancel the contract and start again. I was advised to ring back the following day giving it time to cancel on the system. When I rang on the 17th December 2024 I initially spoke with someone who insisted I would have to accept the old contract which hadn't been cancelled to get the deal despite me explaining that it had the wrong address and sort code. This gentleman put the phone down on me. With trepidation I phoned Vodafone back again on the 17th December once I went into my local Bishops Stortford store for some moral support at 3.20pm. I spoke to a gentleman on-line a Vodafone Customer Service called Stephan who was extremely rude and talked over me and after nearly two hours we were no further on with the process with him insisting the old contract was still online. The staff in store were extremely kind and supportive to me particularly Ben and his trainee, Ali, but unfortunately they could do nothing as the contract was still open on-line. Stephan advised to ring at 8am on the 18th December and he would cancel my original order. When I rang again today at 8am I spoke to Corrie who was polite and helpful but when he re-did the order again unfortunately when he got to the end of the process, it still wouldn't go through despite saying my order had been cancelled at 02.20am on the 18th. I was advised to ring again on the 19th which was the following day, noting that this deal ended at midnight on the 19th.I took the risk of ringing again today at 5.20pm and spoke to a very pleasant, empathetic young girl called Imaan, who was based in Lancaster. She reassured me that she would do her best to solve my problem and asked relevant questions which give me hope. At two different stages she checked with someone senior that the correct process was being followed and double checked my details with me to ensure everything was correct. She apologised for the distress I had encountered over the last four days with Vodafone and was genuinely caring towards me. Imaan managed to successfully process my order for the Apple iPhone and hopefully it will be delivered tomorrow. Her service was faultless. However the last four days has been an extremely distressing and stressful experience with the online service with Vodafone with each phone call at times taking up nearly two hours of my time. I praise Ben and Ali in the Bishops Stortford store and Lovely Imaan today but as for the other staff unfortunately I rate the overall service as poor.Where do we go from here, I would expect more than a written online apology for the time and stress this has caused me. I am sure Vodafone can do their homework and work out by the details I have provided who this service user is!!!!!",0
"New broadband, engineer booked set date many messages and emails confirming, booked days holiday waited in all day no engineer Rang Vodafone transferred four different departments 38 mins on phonePromised “we will call you within 24 hours to rebook” Guess what no call back after they text me to confirmWhat rubbish level of service",0
Had internet issues over a week. Promised a call back never happened. Called again and again offered a manager callback never happened. Their customer service is truly AWFUL,0
Pack of lies by the specialist team trying to tell me that they cancelled my package and carried out a credit check because the order was submitted wrong but won't tell me what was wrong. Awaiting their final response before going to the financial ombudsman service!,0
If I could give 0 I would have.They install the broadband then forget to install the landline I lost a full week of income ( business broadband) lost near enough £5k and this scammers thieves offered me £150 as they don’t compensate for the damages caused.Avoid at all costs this scammersI have follow every instructions possible you forgot to activate the line blaming BT first then some other random stuff and took no responsibility whatsoever for the damages caused.Rather than be sorry do something fair about it !!You know how to contact me! I will update if any attempt to contact me happens ( I doubt it as the reply is very standard),0
"Worst telecom company ever avoid at all cost they don’t honour their words and they keep making false promises without fulfilling them. After I cancelled my contract with them and switched to their pay as you go to keep my options open due to their unstable internet connection they disconnected my number despite saying they would transfer me over to pay as you go. And when they got me back my number after multiple long phone calls l, I kept asking them to tell me how much I owe for my final pay monthly contract bill and every time I would speak to an adviser they would give me different amounts with one saying roughly £22, the other saying £15, and the last saying nothing is owed which he confirmed repeatedly with me. However, after few weeks I was surprised to be contacted  by a debt collector who told me that they were sent by Vodafone to collect an owed amount of £19, despite being told by Vodafone that my account was clear. Therefore, I decided to call them and ask why they lied to me and went behind my back to debt collectors and guess what I was met by a rude advisor called Andi who was shouting at me after hearing my frustration as if he is the customer which was quite shocking. Anyway, after transferring me to the bills’ team I spoke with the most boring and dis-engaged adviser who was not bothered to understand what went wrong. I ended up raising a complain and making the stupid payment hoping that they won’t call back again with another bill after confirming my account to be all clear.",0
"Took out broadband with Vodafone, during the installation our property was damaged.Put a complaint through Vodafone in the complaints department which have been as useful as a chocolate tea pot in resolving this. The complaints department have lied multiple times. We’ve been waiting over a week to speak to a manager and keep being harassed by the same rep that has lied multiple times saying a manager does not exist, there is no manager, she is the manager, she’s not the manager and then to finally agree to a call back from a manager who just didn’t speak and ended up terminating the call.Safe to say we have now switched to a different company all within the 14 day cooling off period.Vodafone are quick to take your money but when there’s an issue it’s clear they don’t have any respect for their customers to try and help them resolve it. Instead they like to play games and pass you from pillar to post wasting your 14 days in order to lock you into a contract.All of our calls from Vodafone were recorded our end and I would advise everyone to record any contact you have with them to prove any lies from their part.Will never use Vodafone or recommend them ever again.",0
"Why did I leave O2Sometimes the cheaper phone contracts are not always the best thing.Signal is in and out like a yo yo for a start.The roaming charges are ridiculous. No add on available to buy if you travel out of Europe.Come on Vodafone step in to the real world.I can not imagine being told to use a SIM card from another company from o2 , three or EEYes I know you have a global package but tell people about it.You can charge people 7.39 per day for roaming because you don’t have anything in place.I will never use Vodafone again",0
Absolutely horrendous service. I was on call with them for two hours to fix my account and no solution. They have extremely slow service and poor customer care team who do not understand the issues.,0

"What is going on, without sending the phone to the repair centre, how come Woolwich branch decide that the phone is not covered in warranty. The application form says “Good news your device should be covered by our warranty”.And the branch gave the reply “the phone should open to see if it is valid to repair”. If the phone is working then why even we bother to come to your place. Still there is three months to end the contract. I got it repaired for my sister paying £389 cause of urgency.Better deal with it, or stop creating and selling bullshit. And, now to hide the 1 star, you are creating fake reviews, wow! 🤮🤮🤮",0
"Would give 0 if it was an option! Appalling service all around.Had the broadband service since May, does not work. Vodafone checked and said there was a blocker at my house, they did not know why but that I would need a booster, but they could not send a booster on the £33 month plan I was on. Have been paying £33 per month since May for a service I have not had! Vodafone have now switched me onto another of their plans (same price but speed not as fast?!) and agreed to send a booster, which was supposed to come on Tuesday, said I would need to be in, so I took the day off to stay home, no one came. I contacted Vodafone and they discovered that they had arranged for the item to be delivered to an old address, despite that fact that since May I have always been at my current address, which is where the engineers came, the account is set up at current address and the email confirming about the booster being sent was at my current address, so why it was arranged to old address is anyone’s guess!Vodafone agreed to amend delivery to correct address and agreed to send today. Again had to take day off, waited in, again did not come. 1 hour and 10 minutes on the phone to Vodafone for them to say they don’t know what happened today, and they can’t arrange for it to be delivered today now so will put it in for tomorrow, I explained I can’t take another day off, and I have no confidence it will be delivered anyway. Asked to speak to a manager but they said they can’t put me through to anyone, and would arrange for someone to call me back, but can’t say what time because they said the call will come from Eqypt or India.I can’t leave Vodafone, because I am stuck in a  24 month contract, and I will have to pay for 24 months (because they have just switched my plan) upfront if I leave.Just an appalling service all around, and I am stuck in it!",0

"Extremely Disappointed with Vodafone’s Device Care Plan ServiceI am beyond frustrated with Vodafone’s Device Care Plan. My iPhone’s display had a problem, so I took it to Vodafone for repair, expecting it to be covered under my plan. However, despite multiple visits, they refused to repair my phone and kept making excuses. I ended up having to pay £389 to get it fixed at the Apple Store, when, according to my Device Care Plan, Vodafone should have handled it for free.I trusted Vodafone to honor the plan, but their lack of assistance and poor customer service has left me extremely disappointed. If you’re considering Vodafone’s Device Care Plan, be aware that it may not offer the support you expect, and you might be forced to pay out of pocket for repairs that should be covered.",0
One star is simply being generous I would rate this company -5. We wanted to change our phone line & broadband services so looked on u switch that recommend Voda phone so we went with them on the 13th December which was the given activation date. We went for the pro 2 deal S we run our business from home. The day of activation came & went & as we all know how easy it is to set up a router was surprised to see after 24hrs still no signal or connection so phoned the helpline. Unfortunately that’s where the problems started it took 5 attempts to call the helpline centre based in the Philippines due to the line cutting out but still ticking over on time which as we are not a Vodafone customer standard rates apply. After an exhausting 3 hrs of calls we were informed that the router has a fault. They would have to send out a new kit and reactivate on the 19th December so for the sake of my business I cancelled the contract which had been going for 48hrs. They duly accepted this and I got a cancellation of contract email. I was then informed that a returns label will be sent out by email within 48hrs. I still haven’t received this & then read the email regarding cancellation of contract noting that if the equipment isn’t returned within 14 days I could be charged £1050 four days have now passed. I also arranged for another broadband supplier who was supposed to have connected me on the 19th December. The new supplier called me to day to say that they will have to cancel the contract I made with then as Vodafone have frozen my landline number and broadband leaving my business before Xmas destroyed. No customers can phone us through our website & we can not send out invoices and 4 quotations for work we were tendering.  I have now phoned this call centre 14 times and have got no further apart from a dubious promised it will be unfrozen on the 19/20th December which gives me no internet until the new year. For all this incompetence they have charged me £45.I have taken hours to try to sort this but now it’s in the hands of trading standards as there’s no doubt I will be seeking compensation for lost of business due to people in a call centre that are utterly untrained to do there job I’m really lost for words living in the U.K. & I will be without an internet connection & phone line for at least 4 weeks in total.,0
"This is the 3rd time Iv posted a review about this lacklustre so called broadband provider ,After hours and hours of mind numbing phone calls trying to sort out my broadband due to lack of strength and being sent a pathetic booster box which hasn’t made any difference in performance i don’t know what to do,, but what I do know that its taken over 3 months now to try and get what Iv been paying for the 30 days I was given to get my money back if I decided to cancel has unsurprisingly lapsed but I’m sure Vodafone know exactly what they are doing so you are trapped for 24 months ,Absolutely disgusting in my eyes .I live in a small 2 bed bungalow and and my Vodafone signal ( fibre 2 ) has trouble going beyond the front room the router is positioned lol it’s a joke , so Vodafone upgrade me to fibre 2 with a booster box 6 and it’s exactly the same , even my ring doorbell is still dropping outDO NOT  and I mean DO NOT waste your money on this diabolically run provider unless you like the piss taken out of you .I had so many people say to me not to go with Vodafone at the start but I thought that I couldn’t be that bad so I give it a go :-(((  I wish I had listened to them now good god !!!",0
"Over the past few days I had the worst experience of my life trying to buy an additional line on my Vodafone account.I bought my line online and asked for porting my number from another network. I never received the eSim on email. I got in touch with Vodafone support via Tobi and the customer rep said you will receive it by end of the day. But I didn't receive receive it.Today I tried to connect with customer support via Tobi and I was shocked by the quality of service.I asked for escalation and complaint, the customer rep was resisting offering £10 as compensation. I continued to insist.To summarise, my issue is still unresolved. The quality of support is horrendous and offshoring support has surgically removed any sense of accountability, quality or ownership from Vodafone.It's a shocking experience. I will cancel both me and my wife's accounts and move my network to a competitor.My trust is completely broken!",0

"Dear Vodafone Customer Service Team,I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the service I have received following my decision to switch to Vodafone for my internet and landline services.I signed up for your service after being assured of a smooth installation process. However, the experience has been anything but satisfactory. Here’s a summary of the issues I have faced:1.	Missed Installation Deadlines:•	An engineer was scheduled to install my services on 12th December but was unable to complete the task, citing a lack of proper equipment. I even provided a ladder to assist, but the installation was still not completed.•	I was informed the issue would be resolved the following week, but this promise was not kept.2.	Repeated Delays:•	Despite contacting your team again, I was assured the problem would be resolved within two days. However, I have now received a text message stating the new installation date is 2nd January.3.	Significant Financial Losses:•	As a business owner who relies on a card payment system, the lack of internet has resulted in a daily loss of approximately £250. This period includes some of the busiest days of the year for my business.Your repeated delays and broken promises have caused me not only financial loss but also reputational damage as I’ve had to turn customers away.What I Expect:•	Immediate prioritization of my installation before the new year, as further delays are unacceptable.•	Fair compensation for the financial losses I have incurred due to your failure to meet your obligations.If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. I trust that Vodafone values its customers and will address this matter seriously.I look forward to your response within 2 worki",0
"Broadband order date was October 13th, OpenReach engineer came out no problem and installed the fibre cables November 29th, however the router box never arrived and was being sent back to Vodafone apparently. The first person (out of a total of 6 after this mess) we spoke to at Vodafone said they would send us a new router box, we had no email confirmation for this so called up again the next day to double check, as we had waited long enough and had been without wifi which when you both work from home, is essential. This person said that the original order had apparently never gone through which we found strange considering we had an order number, confirmation, and already had OpenReach install the fibre cables so how that had happened we do not understand, and it didn't seem anyone at Vodafone understood either. We had a new order made, and were told they would cancel the OpenReach engineer and send us the new router box which would arrive within 3-5 days. No next day delivery was given, which it should have been considering what we had been through. After what we thought was a simple request of re-sending us the router turned into a whole new order, we were hoping it had been resolved - but of course not. We had another email saying an OpenReach engineer would be installing fibre in January 2025.... which we obviously did not need because they had done their job already we were simply waiting on Vodafone to send us this router. We called again to cancel this engineer coming to prevent wasting OpenReach's time, then to be told by Vodafone that we wouldn't be able to get the router box until January now (even though the person the previous day had told us 3-5 days...) because apparently there was a 'problem' with our street and OpenReach needed to come out to sort it... in January?! Completely and utterly ridiculous. Nobody at Vodafone it seems talks to each other or has a scooby about what is going on, as we have been told a different excuse by every person we have spoken to - nothing aligns and therefore I don't believe any of the excuses. If there was a problem with our street this would have been explained in the email, however it was just the generic installation email which meant the whole order was starting from scratch again, even though we had emphasised profusely to Vodafone that all we required was the router box, nothing else. As you can understand at this point we were beyond fed up, we would never have signed up to Vodafone had we known we wouldn't be getting wifi until January, when we made the order in October! The most frustrating thing is that no one seemed to have a clear answer and what should have been a simple fix, turned into a huge headache that led us to cancelling both the broadband and our mobile contract, it has been an awful service. After all of this, at no point was any compensation offered - apart from 10% off our current mobile contract which was a sneaky pitch to sign us up to a further 2 years! Absolutely not. Appalling service wasting not just our time but our money, as we have had to go out to buy a temporary sim to provide us with some wifi whilst we sorted out this mess. Extremely frustrating process which needs a lot of work.",0
"Hello, I applied for home internet from your Vodafone branch and they said it would be £30 per month but 3 home internets were opened in my name, two of them are mobile home internet and the other is normal home internet and the amount I have to pay monthly is £65.

"A falling branch knocked down the fibre line near my property on the 24th November. I reported the fault immediately to the customer service team. It is now 16th December. I have made ten calls to the customer service team, had seven different Openreach engineers visit, been given three different dates to put the cable back up and still the cable has not been reconnected. The first engineer told me that a pole might need to be replaced but a temporary repair could be done in the meantime and would take about an hour. Still the cable has not been reconnected. We are pensioners living in rural Wales and rely heavily on this service as our telephone is VOIP and therefore not working either. Our mobile service is patchy at best and we are concerned that we are now facing Christmas unable to connect with family and friends. The customer service approach is hamstrung by adherence to script and distance from the problem and despite escalating the complaint to a manager we have made no headway whatsoever. I am sick and tired of being told how sorry everybody is for these are just words to dismiss me when what is needed is action to remedy the problem. This level of customer service is deplorable for a global company and I will certainly consider my options when contract renewal is due.I am writing an update to my review having seen the reply from Vodafone. If the respondent had read the review more carefully I made it clear that the fault was reported on 24th November. Storm Darragh occurred on 7th December. That gave a window of two clear working weeks to take action and rectify the problem. Even if a specialist team was needed to put in a new pole, a temporary repair could have been effected to keep us online and this opportunity was not followed up. I have now had four dates promised and passed and I still have no internet or phone. The call count to the customer service line is now up to thirteen and a total of seven hours spent trying to get an answer to this problem. All I keep hearing is ""we are waiting for an update from Openreach"". I have escalated the complaint once again and am now told that someone will be in touch within the next seven days. I cannot help but reflect that if my monthly direct debit had been refused the action would have been far more swift and robust. This whole episode is an absolute masterclass in how to irritate and alienate paying customers who rely on a service which is not being provided. Maybe if the customer service was more focused it would not be necessary to have a team monitoring social media to deflect and excuse poor reviews.",0
"I switched from Sky to Vodafone and was told by sky that my activation date would be 16/12/2024 midnight. As Vodafone told Sky this was my activation date, sky cancelled my service. I have no internet and Vodafone are saying it will be activated at midnight on 17/12/2024. I should have stayed with Sky. Poor service.",0
"Was a customer for years with no complaints until i moved house. I gave Vodafone 3 weeks notice to switch to my new house. Initial call was a sales call where they upgraded the package and signed me up to a mobile phone contract with them. They passed me through to 'easy switch' team to manage the disconnection and connection at the new property - this was the most laborious and ineffective process i've ever experienced.After going through all the terms and security questions (that I'd already gone through with the sales team) I'd been on the phone for an hour and a half. However, they could only arrange a connection in the next few days (i was moving in 3 weeks) so called me the following tuesday to get a date closer to move-in. I had to go through all the same scripting again on that call and the connection was booked for the day before we moved in.I then received a call/text a few days before the move to say they could no longer offer the arranged connection date. So i had to call them back, go through the same scripted telephone conversation again - afterwhich they told me they could connect a week after we move into the new property.We both work from home so internet is vital (which is why i gave them 3 weeks notice). The 'easy switch' process is anything but. Hours and hours on the phone with them answering the same questions and listening to the same script only for them not toCall handlers failed to understand the simple outcome i (and anyone else moving house) needs, which is ""I want to move in on xxx date and I want the internet to commence before i move in"". Instead, call handlers just talk at you and give you options and information that is not relevant or helpful - over and over again.When i called to complain they didn't really seem to understand what a complaint was and how to handle it. At one point, someone rang me back then put me on hold just to return and say they had referred me to a manager who would ring me back tomorrow. Not much help to me after i'd cancelled the contract!Just a mess of a process and call handlers who didn't seem to grasp what I needed/wanted from their service. I would avoid moving house with them - much simpler and easier to go with a new provider.",0
"I paid £12 to activate 8 days of roaming, but every time I try to use the internet, it says ""No Internet Connection""—despite showing a 5G signal! This is absolutely unacceptable! And shows 8 day roaming is active!!!The chatbot Tobi is completely useless and offers no real help. I’ve been a loyal Vodafone customer for the last 12 years, and while the first 10 years were decent, the last couple of years have been absolutely terrible.They tricked me into renewing my contract just before I went on holiday, without mentioning the roaming charges had changed. When I returned from my holiday two weeks later and tried to cancel, the store told me it was “too late” and that I’d have to pay almost the full value of a yearly contract to leave. What a joke!I cannot wait for my contract to end so I can move to another provider. Vodafone has become the worst company ever in my experience. Never again!",0
Worst service all over United Kingdom.,0
What a waste of time paying for something your not received. Chat line is terrible just keep going over and over the same question. Paying for a mobile number i have never received. But refused to cancel and help .reply off Vodafone. Is going on to Facebook or Instagram what a lot off help this is never used Vodafone. Total rip-off.,0
"Endless problems with broadband installation and now mobile phone contract. Hours on the phone over the last 3 weeks after agreeing to renewal of mobile and broadband contracts. Ended up cutting my broadband off before installing it at a neighbour’s flat, several weeks without broadband now, and I work from home regularly, making this almost impossible. Now I find they have not given me Mobile roaming to Europe which I checked was still included as travel to Europe regularly, away to check voice recording now. Over 5 hours of my life spent on this so far, they should be paying me.",0
Awful service I have issues my broadband Internet it keeps dropping connection and I lose connection to devices for sometime now every time I contact them via chatbot to report issue the customer service is OK they go through the same procedure and surly the issue is fixed for couples hours and then it returns. I have expressed the issue is either with router or outside street network. Vodafone customer don't seem to care or offer any solution in this matter. When I request new router they simply refuse saying its working but as I know its not working adequately. All I would say is I will.avoid renewing my contract with Vodafone in the future. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS.,0
"Sorry Vodafone - ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!  We took out a new Sim the other week - £20 a month for unlimited data, calls, texts etc.Rang today and asked - our 2 existing sims that we’ve had since 2010 (both out of contract), why can’t we change them to the same £20 a month deal?Got told ‘that £20 a month is for new customers only - nothing we can do, best we can do is £23 a month’Thats AWFUL - someone in product should be sacked for that - existing loyal customers should get BETTER deals than new customers to ensure retention.We’ll keep the new Sim as its working fine, but Vodafone will lose the 2 existing SimsIts high time Ofcom stepped in and just like insurance companies  forced phone providers to offer existing customers the same deals as new customers on renewal!In the mean time Vodafone product teams can should ‘read the room’ and do a lot more to ensure customer retention - there’s only so much customer services and sales can do if their hands are tied by poor deals for existing customers!",0
Customer services absolutely appauling. Twice got cut off after call handler couldn't be bothered to keep going after 45 minutes or so -  after agreeing problem was difficult to fix. They literally couldn't be bothered to keep on the call.,0

"I recently ordered a Full fibre broadband from Vodafone. While ordering online, i was told that Vodafone will take care of the switching process and let Virgin media know that i am switching over to Vodafone. Immediatly after the order i got an email from the Virgin Media as well. After the installation, when i spoke to Virgin Media, they mentioned that Vodafone has not notified them of the installation date so they have not siwtched off the service.Vodafone said they can not notify virgin media since its a completly new line and not a take over of Virgin media line.Now i have to pay to Virgin Media for an another month to serve the cancellation notice.Vodafone has completly brushed off their responsibility of providing false information at the time of order and customer service representative after showing the snapshots of the order process stating that Vodafone will take care of switching process and notify Virgin Media said that i should have ordered by calling instead of ordering it through website as information on website may not be accurate.",0
"I upgraded to full fibre 500 on 18 Nov from full fibre 2, I believe it was called.  Well, at least I thought I did...got the new contract, and the new billing but saw none of the promised speeds.  In fact, the download and upload speeds have not changed one bit.  I've been on to vodafone every week since, and have been given all kinds of nonsense excuses. Nobody there seems to want to tell the truth.  I was told service was down in my postcode one time, but my service was not down at all.  I was told the 500 needed 24 - 48 hours to settle in!  A week later (now 4 weeks later), no change.  I was most recently told I had to change from cat V cable to cat VI as the V cable was the problem as it limits the speed.  I purchased cat VI cable and of course, it made no difference at all.  I believe vodafone has now run out of lies and excuses.  I have found online that their routers are crap and can't do the higher speeds.  They deny this but can't explain (or won't say) the real reason the speeds customers are paying for aren't available.   They also won't initiate an investigation with OpenReach to investigate and/or fix the problem.  It took them 6 months to sort our my full fibre connection when I first went full fibre. Crooked company.  I asked to raise a formal complaint about 6 times and they wouldn't do it.  I asked several times what their complaint procedure was and they wouldn't say.  I said I had asked for a formal complaint to be registered and when I asked them on a later chat what the file number was for my complaint, they wouldn't say.  I have found them to be dishonest cheats who can't be bothered with customers.  Avoid vodafone broadband like the plague.  Their full fibre speeds are a lie and their customer service is useless.Update:  I went on to the facebook link provided by vodafone but there was nowhere that I could see to make contact. Why do I need to go onto facebook anyway to have the speed failure escalated?  I have spent hours on the inane chats for 3 or 4 Saturdays in a row!  vodafone knows all about this and continues to bs their way around it. As for their remark about slower speeds than I am expecting!, it's guaranteed speeds that I am paying for! Is nobody in charge there, and is nobody at vodafone honest?  Why has this not already been escalated?  why has a complaint not already been given a case number?  why do I have to go through the same chat bs everytime and the get lied to about the speeds and what the issue is?  Why does vodafone blank out their guaranteed speeds on the chats when the copy is emailed to the customer?  Feels like a fraudulent company to me, at least the broadband arm.",0
Vodafone Fibre experience summary - ABSURD!I placed my order online and Vodafone cancelled it without telling me and when asked why they didn't know. Their customer service just not capable of resolving simple enquiries. Without any hesitation I refused to place another order and went with a different provider instead.,0
"My phone died on Thursday morning, so at the next most convenient time, I spoke to a Vodafone customer service agent, who prepared a new phone for me via the chat. I explained how very urgent this matter was as my phone is critical, not just for my life, but my work.I was assured, everything was fine and they said one was available to collect the same day from a store not far from me. Fantastic! I thought, what service. After running through a million questions and T&C's I was told that they mucked up the order and now the phone was unavailable, even though i was told it was reserved for me. They then suggested I get the phone delivered, next day, to the store of my choice. I told them the store that was close to me, which is in the same City as I work. We went through another round of questions, only to be told this time, that there is a power outage at their HQ, so she couldn't complete the order, but not to worry, she said she would do it later when everything was back up and running. Feeling rest assured, I went back about my day. What could possibly go wrong.Obviously having no phone, I went on my laptop, at home, to get confirmation that my phone was on its way, as promised, only to be told by a different agent, that the order was cancelled and not followed up.Blood pressure starting to rise, I was reassured that if we place the order again, I will have my new phone delivered, as promised, next day. Wow, thank god.We proceed to go through the 3 hour ordering process, again. This time the order was complete and promised for the second time that the phone will be available for me to collect the next day and that I would receive a message, once ready. I explained that my phone was broken, therefor I had no way to receive a notification. Don't worry, she said, just turn up at the store in the afternoon, and it will be there for you.The next day arrived, I left work at 3pm, to walk into the City centre, which would mean I got there at near 4pm. I told the member of staff that i was here to collect my phone, I had a print out of the order confirmation with me for proof, as well as an ID and Bank card. He wandered off into the back room and came back empty handed. He told me that he sorted out the delivery himself and there wasnt anything for me. Absolutely fuming, I got home to speak to another advisor, only to be told, no, It will be Saturday, but you have to wait for a notification.. I dont have a blooooody phone, how will i know???Dont worry, you will get an email.. Brilliant, so i have to stare at my emails all day, on my day off. What a wonderful way to spend it..So, I dont hold out much hope, that my phone will be there tomorrow. Just seems i have been lied to multiple times and scammed into taking out another contract.Did i mention, I have been a customer with Vodafone for around 20 years and this is how I have been treated.Lied to twice, could be a third and not even a grovelling apology or some kind of reimbursement for the loss of money/time.",0
Received a late payment fee because their app wouldn't let me make a payment (infinite looping loading screen(. Live chat advisor told me they do not have the power to remove such a fee. That's predatory practices and I'll be changing provider immediately as I've never had a late payment before.Edit after reply : Vodafone don't care for customers they care about being paid. They just lost a long term loyal customer for life.,0

"Utterly appalling service from Vodafone! I recently changed from another big name Broadband company as their monthly charges has sky rocketed! So on recommendation I tried Vodafone, the date was set for the engineer to fit the equipment in our home as there was drilling to be done, was then told BT Openreach would need to come out to sort the Line to our house but this was going to be external work so we did not need to be home. Was told BT Openreach would be out one day, there was a no show was then told it would be another week, that day came and went, I contacted vodafone for them to confirm it was going to be yet another week, In total it was 3 weeks and still no BT Openreach...what a shoddy service! I then cancelled for Vodafone to say okay then....a brand new customer who they ere not willing to help and support in any way possible.",0

"I’d like to share my experience with Vodafone and CityFibre regarding my broadband installation and the ongoing issues I’ve faced since then.On Friday, 6th December, CityFibre engineers installed FTTP at my property, which took 1 hour 45 minutes as it was an overhead fibre installation. The Vodafone package promises speeds of 900Mbps, but testing on Ookla showed only 450Mbps. Initially, everything seemed fine, but by the weekend, the internet went down for several hours. After calling Vodafone, it coincidentally came back during the call. I decided to give it time, thinking it might be provisioning.However, on Monday, 9th December, the internet went down again from 8am. My neighbour, who has the same package, experienced the same issue and managed to get an engineer booked for Tuesday, 10th December. When I contacted Vodafone, I was told CityFibre hadn’t completed the job for my address. After several calls, I was advised to wait three days for their Artificial Intelligence system to fix the issue—an absolute joke!On Wednesday, 11th December, a CityFibre engineer called, claiming to be outside my house. However, he was confused and accidentally contacted the wrong customer. When he did arrive, he found that my ONT box hadn’t been provisioned properly during installation. This explained the intermittent service. He resolved it, but on Thursday, 12th December, the internet went down again at 8am.The back-and-forth between Vodafone and CityFibre has been exhausting. Vodafone repeatedly blamed CityFibre, while CityFibre insisted there was no issue. Neither party took responsibility, and I had to push Vodafone to escalate the issue each time. Diagnostics tests were run over and over, but the problem persisted—a flashing red alarm light on the fibre box.To make matters worse, I bumped into a CityFibre engineer on the road, and he confirmed the ONT boxes in my area needed replacing. However, he couldn’t proceed because Vodafone hadn’t submitted the necessary report. Vodafone also refuses to confirm conversations or actions by email, citing internal policies.Despite being within the 14-day cooling-off period, Vodafone has made it nearly impossible to cancel my contract, claiming their system won’t allow it.I’m sharing this to raise awareness about the appalling service from both Vodafone and CityFibre. The lack of communication, accountability, and professionalism has been incredibly frustrating. If this doesn’t improve soon, I’ll be forced to escalate the matter further.",0
"Pathetic useless company can't register my SIM card. Constantly getting prompts saying number not valid etc. yet my phone says Vodafone, and they take money from my balance after buying a bundle.

I should never switched to this network. I've now escalated this to a complaint, next it's ofcom.",0
"My wife and I have been customers of Vodafone for many years, but our recent experience has greatly undermined our trust and confidence in them . My wife had a contract for a mobile data device to which an 'entertainment package' for Spotify had been wrongly applied by Vodafone without her knowledge of consent. This is at the same time that Vodafone was also applying a fee for a Spotify to her mobile phone contract and to my mobile phone contract. She has complained but so far they have not apologised or refunded several hundred pounds for which we feel we have been overcharged. As Vodafone know, it is not possible to use Spotify via a mobile data device. Nor is it possible to have more that one Spotify account registered a single email address held by my wife. Whilst refusing to refund us, they do not seem to be able to prove that the entertainment contract was requested by us nor give any sensible account of why a single customer would have sought to pay for more that one Spotify account through different contracts.I no longer trust this company and trying to resolve this issue through their customer service team has been shambolic and disappointing.",0
VODAFONE are the worst phone company in Britain even more 💩 than KCON as I couldn't even get Broadband and phone landline service with them and they are also liars as they say you can now take any number to anywhere in the country well BT confirms this is rubbish so all I can say I only had a mobile with them that's now CEASED and is now with with EE! Don't be fooled by their lying false promises as they have given me the worst 😤 service of any company in the last fifty years avoid them like the plague and sign up with BT like I did do not use crap VODAFONE,0
"WORSE THAN GHONORREA! Once you have them it is impossible to get rid of them. I've tried three times to cancel with them with no avail, which is 3h of my precious time that I'm not getting back. The service during the years I had them was bad and they very quickly started raising prices, even before the fixed period contract was over last year. Would recommend to Hitler, Stalin and Jeffrey Epstein.",0

I would not recommend this company to anybody at anytime !! This isn't just a one off, it's been continuous for over 2 years !!!",0
"This morning our wifi went down and it turns out that vodafone have accidentally closed our account instead of starting a new one. They have admitted it was their mistake but have now said they cannot get us up and running again until the 31st December which is 3 weeks away! We live in a house with very low signal so we are unable to data hotspot and 2 people work permanently from home. I am absolutely appalled that there is nothing they can do to reactivate our account or fast track us to a new account when it was their mistake and they are leaving us in a position with no wifi for 3 weeks over Christmas. Absolutely no customer service or consideration for their customers to rectify this issue which was their own mistake to start with, beyond disappointed, stay away from this company.",0

"Vodafone have to be one of THE absolute worst mobile phone providers currently in the UK and I'd urge anyone who's considering signing up with them to think twice about doing it!  I had several months of a nightmare time with them, trying to get my, what I thought was a no contract SIM deal with them, sorted out so that I could actually make & receive calls & texts without problems but that never happened.  I had NOTHING but major problems and couldn't make or receive calls or texts, plus they had apparently opened 2 accounts for me and had the nerve to be taking money from my bank account every month too.  I spent mind-numbing hours & hours on their 'chat' service online, 'chatting' to endless various agents, trying to get the issue sorted out, I got endlessly passed from one seemingly barely English speaking agent to another, having all sorts of promises of quick resolution, etc, made but with nothing ever being resolved.I finally pulled the plug and demanded Vodagfone cancel whatever accounts / contracts they had for me and I blocked them from taking money from my bank account for a ZERO service they ever provided me with.  The 'manager' I 'chatted' to online when I told them I was done with them and that they couldn't charge me an early cancellation fee (as I shouldn't have had a contract anyway, and they never provided me with a working service either!) tried to insist that I would have to pay a fee for early cancellation but I made sure in no uncertain terms that he knew they couldn't do that in the circumstances.  He ultimately gave in and said that I would be charged no such fee.  However, fast forward about 6 months and, lo & behold, I received a letter the other day (right before Christmas!) from Lowells (debt collectors who had sent several letters previously until I told them what the circumstances were and I was told they wouldn't contact me again!) claiming I still owe Vodafone around £25.00.  Needless to say, I'm contacting them AGAIN to reiterate that I do NOT owe Vodafone anything after the torturous fiasco and non-service I experienced with them.So, having anything to do with Vodafone can be like a recurring nightmare that you just cannot be rid of.  AWFUL company, AWFUL service and AWFUL money-grabbing, dishonest, incompetent company.",0

That house has had over 100k spent on it innthe last 2 year and hes just ruined it now it means we will have to chissel chases into finished rooms pull up new flooring  then re plaster and re decorate all because the lazy so called 1hour course ""engineer"" couldn't be bothered to do it right. There is a proper desinated place where it needs to be like the old one was so it can feed 2 ports that run to managed switches it would have take him 10 mins extra tops, can this contract be cancelled the installer basically fobbed my mum off, oh and i want all the patch cables back please, he could see it has a professionally installed network which was done when the house had a full rewire a year ago, you have ruined what was a perfect home, Stop calling your installers engineers they are not even close to a engineer, you have caused problems the house has never had, get it sorted and move it to the correct position",0

"Shambles of a company!I contacted Vodafone on their drive for getting full fibre broadband business.   They checked to see if my postcode and address were compatible and offered a great deal that I couldn’t refuse.  They said they would contact my current provider (BT) to cancel and all I had to do was wait 3 weeks for the arranged date.  A week later the router arrived, no problem.  Next week I got a text to tell me that they couldn’t get hold of BT to cancel so I should do it myself.  Did that and arranged cancellation for 10th of December (Vodafone were meant to instal the fibre on 25th Nov), this took me about an hour between being on hold and answering questions so thanks to both BT and Vodafone for that one.  A few days before the instal date, I got another text to say that due to complications with citifibre, there was an issue and they couldn’t make that date.  The fix was on the 28th nov and Vodafone would contact me then to re arrange the instal date.  I mentioned to them the cancellation date with BT so everything needed to be in for then.  No problem they said.No call on the 28th and then on the 4th of December I received a text from citifibre and Vodafone to simply say my order had been cancelled.  After waiting an age on their hold I got through to them for them to blame everything on citifibre and take no responsibility and say I was cancelled and had to deal with it myself.  They’re weren’t interested in discussing any further and only gave me some useless and meaningless apologies.  I had to call BT and start a new contract which of course leaves me cut off for a week between cancel date and new start date.  Cheers Vodafone you useless bunch of liars.",0
"I have been a loyal customer of Vodafone for 15 years, but my opinion has drastically changed since August. My first negative experience occurred when I was charged twice for roaming services during the same period. They insisted that the service had been activated on two separate occasions, leading to a frustrating phone call that lasted nearly an hour and a half as I fought to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident.On October 20th, I made the decision to leave Vodafone due to my initial negative experience and the consistently poor service in my area. To begin the process, I reached out to Vodafone's AI assistant, Toby, and subsequently sent a text to a designated number to inquire about the final payment required to terminate my service. Despite my long-standing relationship with the company, I can no longer overlook the trouble I have facedI received a message and an email confirming that if I decided to leave their service, my charges would amount to £0. Thankfully, I had the foresight to keep both of these records. However, just three weeks later, I was shocked to receive a bill for £327, claiming that I had broken my contract. This was surprising, especially since I have clear proof indicating that my early termination fee is indeed £0.After numerous phone calls and a visit to the Vodafone store, where staff took the time to verify my claims, I finally spoke with a helpful lady from customer service. She listened attentively as I explained my situation and, with a reassuring tone, confirmed that I was indeed correct—there would be no bill for me to worry about. It felt like a relief to have my concerns validated after all the back-and-forth.Just when I believed that my issues with Vodafone were finally resolved, I received yet another bill, this time for £77. Confused and frustrated, I decided to call their customer service to inquire about this new charge. To my dismay, they not only mentioned the £77 bill but also informed me of an additional charge of £327, completely disregarding the challenges and frustrations I’ve faced throughout this entire ordeal with them. At this moment, I am in the process of collecting all the necessary evidence and have requested the recorded conversations related to my issue. I plan to take this matter to the Ombudsman for further investigation. I urge all of you, dear readers, if you value your time and well-being, please consider avoiding Vodafone.",0
"Horrific broadband service, just finished 24 month contract. So happy and relieved to have escaped.Constant connection drops (no issues with previous or post broadband provider)Getting through to someone requires you to go through the most irritating AI chat and takes ages, when you get through, security questions are over the top and too many in comparison to any other service out there. The whole complaints service takes so long and is so infuriating, I think they do it on purpose, or I would of complained a whole of a lot more.Mobile phone service was good.",0

"What an experience I just had with an online advisor at Vodafone.My contract was up for renewal and I was presented with an offer via the app, it was a sim only offer as I recently upgrade my phone . The plan was set out and was highlighted it was similar apart from they removed the entertainment package( Spotify)Since picking the plan it was fine until I received a message stating I was 80% nearing my spend allowance and to that effect my data was cut off.I eventually got online to check and it appeared Vodafone missed out my world traveler options so now i get charged a ridiculous amount for data roaming.So I reached out and got the usual you are out of the 14 day grace period sir!You’ll have to pay a cancellation few, ok that’s fine what is that £768….you can imagine my reaction when I heard that.I stayed calm, or as calm as you’d expect, and explained to them I have been at sea for the past 2 weeks hence why I didn’t catch this earlier.Bear in mind I have been with Vodafone for 20+ years and also have my broadband with them.I was told my only option was, merge your account into another plan, it will cost a bit but at least it will save you from leaving us and  paying the cancellation fee.At this point I had to leave the conversation, basically sounds like the uk labour government has hijacked Vodafone.So if anybody that is looking to upgrade don’t trust the recommendation tariff they pick for you, as it will mostly definitely be wrong and like myself they will trap you in a 24 month contract. Some might say it’s my own fault for not reading terms and conditions but having done this serval times before without issues I wasn’t expecting it.I hope sharing my experience helps others avoid the same mistake.Do I recommend Vodafone yes I do as I have had no issues until now i just thought they would be able to apply the world traveller to my account and it would be fine.",0
"Going round in circles with Vodafone trying to sort out the simple matter of keeping my phone number on a new plan. My port in request was cancelled and so naturally they deactivated my sim card without telling me, so I'm stuck unable to make calls/text/data roaming and paying for something I can't even use!Every time I speak to someone, I'm told something different about the cause and/or solution. They have very dodgy policies designed to extract as much money out of people as possible.I've spent hours trying to sort this with no success and certainly no help from customer services, who promise one thing one day and send me on a wild goose chase the next. The early termination fee is high but seriously seems worth it at this stage! Save yourself the headache and avoid Vodafone like the plague!Update: 11 days on and Vodafone has not resolved my issues. They have given me 2 new sim cards but have been unable to activate them, they've sent me to my nearest store to sort it out in person but I still don't have a sim that works. The links in the reply to my original post  were useless and I was signposted to another account. Would give 0 stars if that was an option. Total time wasters, can't trust them to do anything right.",0
This company are to be avoided they will lie when it comes to the final payment. Also customer service is  terrible no one can speak good English and very hard to understand,0
"I have 3 lines with them and are loyal customer for years as I don’t often want to change but unfortunately this time I’m very disappointed. Since I renew the contract, I have entertainment to choose from but it never worked regardless how many time I contacted them , it never sorted out, they said someone will call to follow up and sort out for me but no one called , I kept calling them and nothing happened. It has been Almost 1 year now . I will not sty with them when my contract finished .Plus the quality isn’t and good like before, 5g speed is slow, often get no signal in some area, price are expensive even you are loyal customer. Think again if you want to join with VODAFONE. Customers service are not good to deal with.",0
"Yet again I allowed myself to be fobbed off by Vodafone media services team, they promised my issues, which they admit is their fault would be sorted by the 9th December, guess what they're not. This company shouldn't be allowed to operate/trade  in the UK.",0
Their signal is terrible and they charged me £5 late fee for not paying the bill.Can I charge them for the time of mine they wasted asking me the same question 3 times In a row when I tried to sort the signal issue?Once my contract is up I will NEVER use Vodafone again.,0
The plot thickens! They cancel my broadband deal because it was incorrectly submitted!!!! I just brought on there website! Affected my credit score and now they have a hold on my line and I can't take out another broadband deal and on top of this Huzefa in the complaints can't handle the complaint at all and avoids my questions! Avoid people!,0
"Cancelled the broadband order as I have absolutely no faith in both Vodafone & Openreach actually doing their jobs. Customer service is useless, they do not listen to the customer, just run down their list of standard responses/checks. Would not recommend.",0
"Vodafone have provided broadband to our home for over 4 years. Every interaction, whether by phone or the awful ""Tobi"" chat has been awful. They do not know their product. They make promises that they break. They lie about what they have done or not done.This week they disconnected my broadband service ""automatically"" when they were supposed to be renewing the contract. They then said that they couldn't provide broadband any more.Obviously I am now moving to a new provider.I cannot stress enough how terrible customer service and support is at this company. I would recommend that you avoid them at all costs.",0
"Dear Vodafone and CityFibre,My name is Ramazan K****, and I subscribed to Vodafone's ""Full Fibre 910 Mbps"" plan on November 6, 2024.I was informed via SMS, email, and phone calls that an engineer from CityFibre would visit my property on November 22, 2024, to install and activate the internet connection. On the scheduled date, two engineers from CityFibre arrived, but they encountered a blockage in the underground duct running from the internet distribution box on the corner of a nearby street to the front of my house. As a result, they could not pass the fiber cable through. They assured me that a team would return within a week to resolve the issue.Since then, both Vodafone and CityFibre—who were very attentive and communicative up until that point—have seemingly disappeared. Despite contacting customer services via phone and written communication, and even reaching out on social media, my issue remains unresolved.I want to stress that no one has come to address the issue since November 22. Please refrain from saying, ""Our team has looked into this,"" unless there is concrete evidence of action.I work from home, and this delay has caused significant disruptions to my professional life. If this issue can be resolved, I urge you to take immediate steps to fix it. I also request a clear, concrete explanation regarding the situation.If this problem cannot be resolved, please inform me transparently so I can cancel my subscription and explore other options.Thank you !",0

"Avoid Vodafone broadband at all costs.If there was an option for zero stars, this is what it would be!Since the beginning of the contract they failed to deliver on the minimum guaranteed speed. Connection dropped completely due to a Vodafone tower fault and they failed to accept responsibility and kept pushing back to open reach. The poor open reach engineer came to our house multiple times despite advising there were 12 other houses in the area, all on Vodafone, all with the same problem, yet all other providers were working as they should be. Again, Vodafone were taking no responsibility for this.Even when complaining, they wanted to charge us the early termination fee of £259! After 30 HOURS of phone calls Vodafone finally accepted liability and waived the termination fee, allowing us to switch to a provider who could actually deliver on their promises,  happy ending right? WRONG. Vodafone have since sent two bills and tried to collect the £259 from my account! 3 more HOURS of phone calls and “someone will call me back in 5 business days” I won’t hold my breath.Absolutely ridiculous from a well established company. Think twice before going with a company who have not an ounce of customer care in them.",0
"Vodafone is pathetic again. I was forced to upgrade to the more expensive fibre wifi package because of pathetic internet speed and persistent connection dropping on their lower priced fibre. I am now on over £40 per month with an advertised 900 mb per second speed and a connection booster.  I am currently struggling to write this review because of very slow speed and the connection perpetually dropping (PO6 4TL). I cannot attend my crucial online meetings. If you contact them, they are arrogant, dismissive and never admit their shortcomings. Please stay very far away from Vodafone. Update: same problem today. I am on 4G now as my wifi is mostly off today. Thank you very much for nothing Vodafone",0
"I recently contacted Vodafone to change my number due to an ex partner constantly calling me off withheld on my previous number everything got changed and I was told it's gone through. At 9pm last night I get a notification that I can not use my phone for any inbound or outbound calls, I contact Vodafone who say that due to a fraud investigation I would not be able to use my phone for 7 days for either incoming or outgoing calls. I'm a carer for a vulnerable adult family member and Vodafone have caused extreme stress doing this last night I was filled with worry that my family member may need to contact me and as Vodafone have blocked everything they wouldn't be able to get through and I wouldn't be able to help them this has caused so much stress for me and my family, I havent slept all night and when I called Vodafone they hung up on me after i explained everything then got through to another agent, who wouldn't allow me to speak to a manager and shrugged it off that it'll take 7 days. I NEED MY PHONE FOR AT LEAST INCOMING CALLS SO I CAN SUPPORT A VULNERABLE FAMILY MEMBER. Awful service I will be raising this to the Financial ombudsman and FCA!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I wish there was a negative star for this broadband company. They are totally pressurising to sell and install a broadband in my property. I have written to them, I have called them on the phone numerous times. I have also been to the local shop to cancel my installation on 20th December, 2024. They are are very difficult and earless company to deal with. I have spent few hours on their website to convince them that: I DO NOT NEED A VODAFONE BROADBAND INSTALLED IN MY PROPERTY. But still sent me a letter yesterday saying that they will come to install the broadband in my property. I am just getting sick and tired of this company. Please some one help me to get through to these people, and cancel my installation. They do not listen - In my language it is called a pressurising sale, which was illegal in the UK. I do not know what else to write. I do not wish to have a vodafone broadband installed in my property. Thank You!Thanks for your reply, but unfortunately I do not use or deal anything on the facebook - facebook should be called an open book...",0
Terrible unreliable service provider. Have not connected my broadband. Also very poor mobile network. Don’t bother with them,0
"Not reliable at all, I don't have service atlist 4 days in a month and internet as well, sometimes they need more than a week to fix it. Poor customer service. I can't even receive calls from my child 😕",0
"I have been experiencing severe issues with Vodafone's mobile internet service at East Croydon Station for the past four months. Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts, SIM swaps, and regular contact with customer service and technical support, the problem remains unresolved. The mobile internet connection is either non-existent or extremely slow, severely impacting my ability to work as a self-employed black cab driver.In addition to contacting customer service every week and sending numerous emails, I have now lodged a formal complaint with Ofcom, the UK telecommunications regulator, due to Vodafone's lack of response and inability to resolve the issue. I also requested to terminate my contract due to the service issues but was told I would need to pay a £180 termination fee, which I find unacceptable given the lack of service.If you're considering Vodafone for your mobile internet needs, think very carefully. In my experience, the service has been unreliable, and the customer support unhelpful. Save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable options.",0
"I am going around in circles with there complaints department a guy called Huzefa where he states my broadband purchase was cancelled because it wasn't set up correctly, but won't elaborate on why, what was the issue? This is ironic when I questioned a incorrect price they then cancel the deal!",0
"Oh dear after a marathon install of untold hours, nothing will work.  Some numpty has decided that Russians will be outside my country home so I must have a 12 digit password. Problem is I would have to reconnect 50 IOT devices that use an 8 digit password, and re-enter more than 150 routines with over 800 commands in. No, thank you.  Just get an unlimited SIM for £18 and find an old phone.",0
Unfortunately the worst internet coverage I have ever encountered. Internet connection drops multiple times a day. The speed is so slow you can't make calls over the internet. As somebody who is working from home constantly having to apologise for my internet provider. The internet you pay for should not be this poor in this day and age. Taking ten minutes to send an email is no joke! Today I couldnt purchase something and had to phone up to complete as the internet timed out on the sale. This is just a few of the issues when trying to use Vodafones internet service. Certainly would not move to them for mobile based on this experience. No point phoning as have not been able to reach a solution to date. They are happy taking my money for a sub standard service.Again missing the point that I am writing this review after the many times of reaching out to Vodafone by phone and email. Just another standard response to a review with no care for the reason why the customer is writing it!My opinion is even lower of Vodafone after this response. I have had nearly a year of poor internet. So not sure when it is going to be better when you say it is variable. Banging my head against a brick wall trying to get any sort of resolution.Didn't think it was possible for Vodafone service to get any worse. Now two and a half hours without reliable internet. Vodafone have now after many previous emails decided my account details aren't correct so can't correspond by email. You couldn't make this stuff up! Avoid at all costs. They are useless by phone and email. Complete lack of customer care,0
Completely messed up my entire home move. Have been with Vodafone for years but this has been an absolute shambles. Will not be paying them and definitely not keeping the contract.,0
"Vodafone Broadband - don't even think about it!All was brilliant until - Activation date. Engineer came on time at 8am, discussed my requirements, then told me nothing could happen by Open Reach for 2 to 3 weeks!! I now have a new date more than 4 weeks later but have no faith that they will turn up, complete the connection and activate the service. Meanwhile Virgin are now charging me some extortionate out of contract rate. I'm not holding my breath about promised compensation from Vodafone either.",0
"I would avoid at all costs, awful. Had problems since the installers installed in wrong place having to ring up about 5 different occasions hour long phone calls, write 3 complaint forms the latest one was 11 days ago and no response. Brought best internet and it can’t even get signal in a small flat. Awful customer service.",0
"Horrendous service. Horrendous customer service. One even told me to ""mind my words"" when I said the service was rubbish. The router drops connection all the time. Even in the same room. Only got this because virgin don't cover our area. Cancelled.",0
"Promise one phone send a different.  Contract says one thing and they send something else, then deny the facts. So disrespectful.  Three members of staff confirmed the phone doesn't match the contract including the branch manager. But then send the big guns to deny and lie totally ignore facts. No interest in resolving problem.Even the branch manager agreed it was wrong and refused to rectify as in his words I don't trust them. I've only been a Vodafone customer for 26years, never defaulted. But this is typical of such large companies they don't care or respect loyalty.Having researched Vodafone it appears they often mislead people to sign then up.I really do question there 4+ stars when 35% give ONE STAR reviews.AVOID",0
"I keep ringing to speak to someone with sense. 1 in 10 calls you might get someone with common sense, but I doubt it. Small minds think we all have social media. Not everyone is a follower. I REPEAT small minded people. NO SOCIAL MEDIA IN MY WORLD.",0
"Been suffering from constant disconnection issues from our new Power Hub.Can’t watch films or game, without multiple disconnections, it’s frustrating. We have contacted their tech team, going through all different settings, still does it! Now my sons PlayStation 5 won’t connect at all, however fine at a friends house!!Looking online, this seems to be a common problem with Vodafone’s power hub. Rather than looking at their own kit, they lay blame on our connection and attempt to upsell us, to the next bundle. My question is why? The line remains the same? Just the router that’s different, which sounds very suspect to me!Power Hub is not fit for purpose!!I have been tempted, on many occasions to just end the contract and pay the fee, it’s that bad!!Previous routers with BT, EE and Sky, no problem at all!Next stage, I will have to escalate this to their complaints department followed by Ofcom. Only 3 months into a 2 year contractI would not recommend Vodafone broadband with the PowerHub if you want to keep your sanity!! Just google other reviews, shameful30/12 - Update, after allegedly monitoring our home WIFI since the 27th December, apparently there is not problem, yet any streaming device gets thrown off the wifi intermittently.  They saying my house is the problem and I must purchase boosters from them.  I explained my TV is 10 ft away from the router in the same room, yet Vodafone are laying blame at my property! Why would I need to boost a signal 10ft, oh and it must be a Vodafone booster not third partyIn a nutshell, it looks like their products are not fit for purpose.  They sell wifi cheap, lock you in with a contract, it does not work, so they try and get more money out of youInternet speed, according to their checks are fine, yet I have speed checks, carried out on the Vodafone app, sitting next to the router, as below:-29/12 @ 10:20 - 4.6 mps29/12 @ 10:18 - 9 mbs29/12 @ 10:17 - 6.6 mbs29/12 @ 10:16 - 15.3 mbsAll other times, upwards of 60 mbsStay well away!!

Unprofessional and glad it was cancelled now. Will let every customer know each day until they tell me why they handled my case the way they did!",0

AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!!!!",0
"Do not ever use this company. Been with them 15 years plus. I have 2 device  plans with them. If u are late paying for it by 2 or 3 days they threaten court action. And then text messages, emails every single day. No wonder people  feel suicidal by the constant threats. Absolute  scumbags guys. Stay well clear",0
Staff very helpful but systems a complete joke. Kept crashing. Took over an hour to upgrade two Sums and buy a phone… terrible experience for a “tech” company…,0
"Been with them 2 years, bad signal and terrible support. Avoid them. I will never go back.In this 2 years I could compare with my other phone, 90% of situations when vodafone had no signal the other one did.Also when I ended the contract they did they best to stop me and delay me and a month later still owe me from my last invoice about 20 gbp.  Avoid them like the plague.",0
"If there were zero stars, I would rate that. I'm leaving vodafone, trying to return their equipment, as I don't just want to chuck it in a bin. I understand they're supposed to offer this recycling service. (They probably just send the waste to a third world country landfill site, but that's their choice.) I can't even get them to sort this simple request out. The Tobi chatbot is useless. The human advisor just stopped the chat and completely ignored me. What's the point of wasting my time any more. Into the bin, and landfill, it goes.",0

"Until today Vodafone would be getting 5 stars from me. I have been a customer for over 15 years and have never once had a complaint about the service.Today however they have sent me a threatening email after I upgraded my broadband telling me that if I don't return some wireless dongle that I never asked for - and which never worked as they didn't send me a SIM for it. Vodafone are threatening to charge me unless I return this useless bit of plastic to them... In a box with its leaflets... 2 years after it was originally sent to me.Their contract terms are absolutely clear that they cannot demand return of equipment beyond the 14 day contract cooling off period:""3.7 Equipment. We will supply the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone equipment to you. You can use your own router to receive the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone Services but you must: (i) ensure it is compatible; and (ii) use your Vodafone router in order to display speed information on the Vodafone Broadband app. If you are a Vodafone Fibre to the Home Broadband customer (previously known as Vodafone Gigafast Broadband): (a) speed information will not be available on the Vodafone Broadband app; and (b) you will need to use the Vodafone router in order to use the phone services. You must not connect equipment to our network that may harm it, or anyone else's equipment or services. If the Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone Services are terminated (by you or us) prior to activation or during the 'cooling off period' (see 7.3(a) below) or due to any unavailability issue, you must return all equipment which you have received under your Agreement. Failure to return any equipment when requested to do so may result in charges in line with our Returns Policy7.2. Return of Equipment. If the Home Broadband and Phone Services are terminated by you or us prior to your service activation date or within 14 days of your service activation date then you must return any Vodafone Home Broadband and Phone equipment to us within 30 days of cancellation. If you do not return the equipment within 30 days or if it is damaged when you do return it, you will be charged a reasonable fee as set out in the Price Guide. We'll advise you on how to return any equipment on cancellation.""I have now wasted 2 hours on webchat and phone trying to get to the bottom of this and frankly I expect better.",0
"Beware of switching to Vodafone. If something go wrong you’ll be left without a working phone for days, and will be fobbed off with fix timescales that they don’t observe. It seems like nobody knows what is going on.There is no sense of urgency, they don’t seem to care.",0

Promised calls back with resolution but nothing. Third time today - they promised to call me back again and have not.My advice is to avoid this company at all costs - they have no idea what customer service is. Maybe it’s because I don’t use my phone a great deal, who knows, but they couldn’t care less. Even the retentions department are not bothered. Good luck to phone company 3 in your merger with this lot.",0
"Took out business broadband with them In Feb after being told lies that I could have it at the new address I was moving to - I checked multiple times before taking out the contract but when we came to add at the new place I was told it wasn't an option!Requested cancelation straight away and finally on Nov 20 I was told this could be cancelled and no fees to pay as I was being charged for a contract I couldn't and had never used!I had called over 10 times before and told this and was assured everything was now settled.Now on the phone with them today 06/12 because I have a debt agency contact me and I have missed payments on my credit file.Customer service is shocking and no doubt outsourced somewhere abroad so its hard to understand them and I spend hours of my time going round in circles, same with online chat.I am a personal Vodafone customer and been with them for over 20 years!I'm appalled by my experience and that no one in customer services seems to care of the effects this is having to my life, my credit file and the hours I have spent trying to fix this.1 Hour and 3 agents in and we still aren't fixed...Shame on you Vodafone!",0

"Between January 2015 and November 2017 Vodafone took £2,908.07 from my bank account which was £96.93 per month. The last month I paid them, they took £533.16. At this point I had to walk away from their services because I simply couldn’t afford to pay. This was for use of my phone when I was briefly on holiday. They then proceeded to pursue me for a debt of £1891.05 for unpaid charges. This amounted to a total of £4,799.12 of charges over 30 months which worked out at £159.97 per month. This legalised theft has since been regulated although there are still ex customers like me still being pursued through the high court for these ridiculous charges. Needless to say, Vodafone do not care about you as an individual and are only interested in exploiting you for monetary gain. I strongly recommend that customers do not sign up with Vodafone.",0
"Adoid Vodafone for broadband. I have broadband at my current house and wanted to move the service to the house we are moving into, however Vodafone could not offer the same service at the new house.

I give one month notice to terminate the contract and I paid the last bill.Vodafone didn't terminate the contract and kept charging me for a service I never used.

"I have worst experience with vodaphone. I bought a contract sim 3 months ago from the outlet in bullring near selfridge side from a girl. At the time of contract i asked from her after how long i would be eligible to get a phone on instalments. She misguided me and told me only after 3 moths you can get a new phone. I asked 3 times from her and she replied same. After 3 months i went there and now they are saying that after 6 months i will get phone. I told them about thae words of that girl and and they sais that girl was new. She might dont know about it.such an irresponsible behaviour. If the girl did not lie at that time, i would go somewhere else and get the contract with phone. Internet connectivity of vodaphone is hell. It all the time disconnecting. I am unable to call my mother back home.when i reported the issue, they said to buy a wifi connectionMeans seriously, how can they be so mean to just bind the people in contract and not providing the exact service for which they are paying for.worst experience. These people are scammers. Dont be in any contract with them.",0

"Avoid at all costs. If I could give zero stars I would! I called to confirm my installation for tomorrow to be advised that I failed my credit check. I have NEVER even been late on any payments nor missed a payment for anything. I have received my confirmation email from vodafone thanking me for my order, email confirming date and time of installation, contractinformation, account set up confirmation. They claim they sent a text and email advising that the credit check failed but these have not been received. When I asked them to confirm the number and email address they were sent to they would only say the ones on the account.I raised a complaint and received a call. The advisor gave no further information  regarding what has gone wrong. I have completed a credit check appeal via their website as advised but even if (when) it comes back as an error, I will be refused vodafone for 3 months!Don't waste your time, take your custom elsewhere.",0

"I cancelled my broadband contract in October as I was moving out of a flat and wanted to use a different provider.Due to a problem on Vodafone's end it didn't cancel properly despite receiving confirmation of cancellation. I have continued to be charged as normal despite contacting their Helpdesk every month.Each time I get passed around departments and supervisors until someone promises it's definitely sorted now and I'll get a refund next month.I'm still being charged and I'm now told that they have to charge me again in January and then I'll have to come to them again and follow up myself so someone can sort the refund. So I've paid them nearly £200 extra for no reason and it's on me to chase them up because there's ""nothing they can do"".The people you talk to are actually trying to help, but the structure Vodafone has set up seems designed to make you frustrated in the hope you'll give up and pay them extra.Other providers have figured out how to make it simple for customers, Vodafone don't want to.

I raised a complaint and had Huzefa deal with it who was quite frankly incompetent,  said he's cancelled my broadband because they couldn't honour the deal and to sign up to another deal?! Unprofessional and glad it was cancelled now. Will let every customer know each day until they tell me why they handled my case the way they did!",0

I was thinking of switching to Vodafone broadband and got most of the way through the process of buying a plan but it said there was an issue with the basket and their website seemed slow. I tried using the chat to see what the issue was but got nowhere as the call centre were not helpful about the security questions. I have been a customer of their mobile phone service for decades. I will probably just stick with my current broadband provider because I don't need the stress.,0
Based on my experience Vodafone does not make it easy for a new Broadband customer.They cancelled my order suddenly and make me jump through hoops just to question why.I was subjected to inflexible security checks and asked for a PIN (which I wasn't given) and a whole list of questions and requirements for ID proof in response to asking a simple question about what happened to my order.,0
"Ordered a new device online. Order confirmation received with a pre-contract agreement and a delivery date for the device, £30 handset charge taken out of my account. Device did not arrived, phoned customer service who informed me order not placed even though they had taken my money and confirmed the order and delivery date with an email. Even though the fault is with Vodafone they will not honour the agreement. Nukunj, the advisor agreed she can see the confirmation email that I copied into the chat but would not offer any further support than canceling my order and I can reorder at the new inflated rates.I did reach out as suggested below so you can investigate which you clearly didn't as immediately when I reached out the response was Hi michelle.russell24 ! 👋Thanks for reaching out to us.We're not a customer service account, but we can help you find the right one.

I am on PAYG 1- cost £1 per day for unlimited calls and texts. If I don't use then it costs nothing. Got a text from them today to tell me they are doubling the price to £2 a day so it is now PAYG2.

Absolute rubbish Top broadband went off everyday for period of time Back up usb didnt work and as regards 14 day cooling off period they drag it on so you get passed the 14 days then charge you to leaveRight hand doesnt know what left hand is doingThere reply is to contact them to get an engineer to testMy account has been INACTIVE for 3 months THE ISSUE IS I’m still being billed and threatened with collection agency,0
"The installation was fine and the engineers were polite and did a very neat job. However, I am having huge issues in connecting my printer which is vital and essential.

"Pathetic Customer service, with customer advisors with attitude problems - Namely one called AJ, most unhelpful, disrespectful customer service agent I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. The hint is in the job title - Customer Service. Having an attitude problem with a customer who has come to you with an issue is a contradiction to the job you are hired to do.An absolutely disgrace to the Vodafone company - Sort out your attitude problem and learn to do better. Lost a customer who has been with the company for a while - advice to any unfortunate Vodafone customers, avoid this store at all costs, instead phone customer service, atleast you will be better treated. Avoid this store at all costs!",0
"My credit rating has been impacted by Vodafone/Checkmyfile as a result of wrong information supplied by Vodaphone, as a result my mortgage application has been turned down. I have spoken to them on numerous occasions by phone and by email. Why is it okay for companies to have the ability to do this to people?. Yet my credit record on checkmyfile is still showing the erroneous information. .",0
Vodafone advertise unlimited broadband but the service I received was extremely limited - almost every day the broadband failed at random times for 20 minutes and some days I had no service at all. Trying to get help is a nightmare as they rely on AI and a call centre in India so the seasons changed while they tried (unsuccessfully) to sort out the various problems. I have returned to my previous provider and have had a full uninterrupted service from day 1. Don’t use Vodafone for broadband.,0
"I took out a Vodafone contract in January at £36 per month, which later increased to £38. While that was still a reasonable deal, everything went downhill after I missed one payment. Since then, Vodafone has been adding late fees every single month for the previous month, driving my bill up to over £42 per month.I tried reaching out through live chat and even on X (formerly Twitter), hoping to resolve the issue, but their customer service was unhelpful and uninterested in finding a solution. Instead of valuing a loyal customer, they seemed more content with losing one.Sadly, I’ve had no choice but to switch networks because the rising costs made the contract no longer worth it. A real shame, I expected better from such a large provider. I wouldn’t recommend Vodafone to anyone who values transparent billing and responsive customer service.",0
"iPhone 14 Pro Max had an issue where the screen turned green, phone was still under manufacturing warranty. Went to the Vodafone store with the phone (I had not damaged the phone other than it had tiny scratches on it which weren’t visible unless looking for them) and they said the manufacturing defect warranty does not cover the cost of a new screen (which they said it needed).Supposedly, even though I had not damaged the phone which they said, due to the scratches the argument is that is most likely what it was. Took it to both Sky and Apple and they had said had it been bought from them it would have been covered under their warranty.Very disappointed, shows that there isn’t really much point in having the warranty.",0
"I phoned up to buy broadband and was offered an upgrade on my handset. I specifically asked for the lowest priced airtime plan and only found out they did not sign me up to this one until later. I asked if they could just amend the airtime plan to the cheapest one and they said no. They said I had to physically drive to the shop and the shop could amend the airtime plan and I could keep the handset. Drove to the shop who said not only they can’t do that but I couldn’t give them the handset to cancel the contract I had to go home and phone them and then post the handset. I have now been on the phone an hour and a half being told there is nothing they can do I have to wait in 2 days for collection then wait up to a further 14 days for the device to be credited to my account before I can even re order. In this time I will be charged the new plan until my account is reverted back to normal. I have never known such bad service and complicated rules in any other company. Ironically my husband is a Vodafone pensioner who is disabled roving thru treat ex staff and customers the same VERY BADLY. How is it so difficult for them to admit they mis sold this plan, fur me to keep the handset and them just alter the airtime plan or even reduce the cost down to the advertised one. I have now got to wait at home 2 days for collection. Every time you phone Vodafone you get a different answer from every member of staff. We have been with them for 40 years but no loyalty. They made a mistake and we are the ones being penalised. Dave yourselves the wasted time and effort and buy direct from Apple",0
"Still awaiting final bill and settlement from social media team, promised to be sorted 23 November.  Obviously, they tell you lies, just as their sales team in the shops and their phone operators. Do not have any dealings with this company, I have been messed around by them since July. The reply to this review is to contact thier social media team to sort it, I've tried that only to be fobbed of with "" sorry we will sort it by the 23rd November "", they haven't yet . Do they expect me to keep falling for thier lies and bad service.",0
"So for a week I have had not been able to load up anything on my phone , I finally called and explained , I had a young lady who laughed every time she spoke after 20 minutes I gave up , I was called back a few days later from emmar , I gave my address out yet again and said this wasn’t what they had for me so I gave out my previous address still saying I couldn’t pass security , I gave my date of birth still not enough , was asked for my PIN code said I hadn’t a clue what it was , even asked to guess it ? What was the point of that ? Apart from giving a DNA sample what do y have to do to get an issue sorted . I have been with vodaphone for a good 30 years . What is it coming to ? I have two accounts with you , maybe time for a change ! Never felt so frustrated in my life . Problem was never sorted ! How can you not know if the service is down in certain areas ? I forgot to add I also gave them my email which they were sending messages to me .  How is that not enough personal information???",0
Is it even possible to speak to a human being?????I looked at joining up with Broadband but when I saw the install date I cancelled it as it was over a month away. Spoke to my current provider who tell me vodafone have put the order through anyway. Scummy company with dubious morals.,0
"We have spent 6 days without internet and get the same pathetic excuses.Our modem completely stopped working after a month of signing up and it took them countless days to deliver a new one.When it did arrive, the internet still didn't work.As with many other people on here, I spent a few hours on the phone to their Asian call centre who tried to be helpfuland in reality did nothing.After losing the will to live I asked to cancel and they had the nerve to say that there would be £80++ fees and we had to send this & that back.So, if anything goes wrong don't expect help,expect to be charged more.If you want to be exploited and give your money away then Vodafone is the company for you!",0
"I was a loyal Vodafone customer for two years, even though the signal occasionally dropped during Microsoft Teams meetings at work. I decided to upgrade to a 500MB plan because of an offer, but the signal worsened, dropping out even more during work hours. Frustrated, I cancelled within the 14-day cooling-off period.When I spoke to an advisor, I was told my contract would revert to my original one, set to end on December 12th. However, upon calling Vodafone to cancel as I’m joining EE, I discovered I allegedly owe £225 because, during the downgrade, Vodafone placed me on a new 2-year contract without informing me.I waited 30 minutes to speak to customer service today, requesting they review the recorded phone call where I downgraded. The advisor clearly made a mistake, and now I’m being falsely accused of taking out a new contract and trying to avoid paying for it.Vodafone, your service has been poor. I’ve included my order number so you can review my account notes and see how many times I’ve contacted you about issues. It’s unacceptable to place me in a new contract without explaining terms and conditions. This is a blatant error and breach of consumer law. Please resolve this immediately.",0

"I've been with Vodafone Broadband for 7 years, and I'm amazed so many people say their customer service is good. It's not.I've moved home and have switched to a different supplier. Vodafone have NOT made it easy for me to cancel my old connection and are still sending me bills every month.I have been out of contract for well over a year and have been on a rolling payment in tht time.I've moved out and no longer need it. How difficult can this be?!Live Chat was terrible (with an AI bot), so I called instead. I explained the problem to the man on the phone, and he hung up.So I sent a letter, along with the return of the equipment, which explained the above and stated that the service should be cancelled.Still they keep sending the bills and still they haven't closed the account.I will never use anything to do with Vodafone again. Terrible experience.The company I'm now with is Airband and so far, so good. The monthly cost is less, the speed is much faster and there are no price hikes for the duration of the contract, which is very different from the yearly price hikes with Vodafone.",0
Had £20 in there waiting for next month suprise disappears day before what a joke no contact number to speak to a human,0
"November 14th, I place an order, receive confirmation, all ok.  November 15th, I call up just to ask some details only for them to tell me my order was cancelled the day before however I had not been told, if I hadn't called I would probably be waiting on installation day only for nobody to show up. Apparently they can't even schedule for a new installation until the previous tenant is out, can't we schedule things in advance this day and age.  They then tell you to wait until the previous tenant moves out before even scheduling the new install and by the way then you need to wait 2 weeks for installation, what, to turn a service on?  So I wait until November 23rd after the previous tenant moves out and has their service with vodafone terminated, make my order, receive an installation date of December 10th, great.  December 3rd, I call, ask if we can't speed things up as the previous tenant also had Vodafone full fibre service and I even have my own equipment, why can't I plug it in and they activate my service.  Nope, not possible, they want to send engineers out to dig up the garden and lay more fibre lines which was just already done for the previous tenant, oh, and at the same time I am told ""things on the back end somehow got turned around and we haven't even scheduled your installation"" so now it's been put back to the 16th.  If I had not called in on the 3rd would I now be waiting around on the 10th only to then be told installation would be around the 24th ie two weeks out.  Not only this but I have had issues with account creation and because so many things went wrong I will also miss out on the £75 voucher during sign up.  What a joke, I have had service installations all around the world and never anything like this, and you get told sorry sorry sorry but the only solution is that your installation gets pushed more and more back.  I just moved into a new place and need internet to buy furniture, set up smart devices etc but sorry, just wait a few more weeks.  My expectations at this point is they will mess up the scheduling again and I'll be lucky to get installed before new year.December 7th Update.The previous agent who placed my new order on December 3rd for installation on the 16th had promised to call me back and update me on the order status, I never heard from them.Here we are on December 7th, I call in, how is the status of my order I ask, ""oh sir, it's ben cancelled"", are you serious, why, who cancelled it and didn't even bother to notify me?New agent, we can place the order again, new installation date earliest available is December 19th...I wish I could give negative stars, this is the most disgusting level of service I have had in my 45 years on this planet from any provider on any continent I have lived.January 2nd 2025 Update.6 weeks after initial contact and countless calls and promises and guess what, still no installation, even promises from so called supervisors / customer support specialists to keep track of your order to make sure it completes and keep you informed, guess what, no order completed and you don't hear from them unless you call them and then you get the usual so sorry but not really sorry garbage.I am out....",0
"3 weeks after joining Vodafone, and service is out. So far, we're on day 4. I spent almost 2 hours on phone and chat service today, to no avail (mostly trying to bypass their request for a 'PIN' (which for some reason I don't have) or their assertion that I was giving them the wrong date of birth, so they could get into my account. Outcome? Nil. Still no service. ""I assure you that our team is working on it"". Is this good service? And they hide behind their long-term contracts, threatening you with penalties if you try to cancel on them. GreatUpdate: look at their reply below. Non-committal, and they offer me the possibility to discuss things with them ""on facebook"" or ""on Instagram"". No offer of a phone number or of an e-mail address. Does everyone have Facebook and Instagram? I certainly don't. Besides, consider how my discussions have gone with them to date; it's basically: you don't have service (for 5 days now)? We're working on it...You can't cancel your service without paying all the unused months in your [2 year] contract.",0
Customer service is useless.First my order was cancelled and they failed to appropriately inform me leading to weeks delay which when you work from home is really impractical.When the order was finally sent they didnt include the adapter needed to connect the hub to the internet port. They advised they send the item out but it was not received. Rang again and they sent a second one out. Still not received. About a week later I got a slip through the post from royal mail asking me to pay a fee for a delivery as it had not been covered by the sender. I paid not know what it was going to be and it turned out to be the missing part. I rang to ask for my money to be refunded and submitted a complaint. 3 weeks later I have heard nothing back. Chased again today and the reference number I was originally given for my previous complaint didn't exist. Have not been offered any compensation or genuine apology.Also when I rang for assistance in setting my broadband up the person on the phone tried to convince me the correct port was located in the hallway cupboard- a location that does not have a power source...Staff clearly read from a script when on a call or on the web chat and it is infuriatingly repetitive.Will be looking to change providers as soon as I can.,0
Really bad experience in my whole life with Vodafone really racist assistance and the manger was racist to he didn’t take any action.Never had a problem in the one in Cribs,0
"The worst provider ever! -- avoid this scam company !! I got a phone on contract for £45 for 24 months.. After 6 months they decided to push to £56 months! -- like a joke!! - so I had to pay this amount for the whole 24 months! .. and then when the contract ended, they decided to charge me extra for a month even though the contract ended..

What a total a waste of time . Ordered a sim upgrade on Black Friday for £20.40 50gb data plus roaming also gout talked in to an additional new sim with 100g for £10 . All sounds good BUT after checking my app on 2nd Dec I see that the sim upgrade has not been applied to the account . I call Vodafone and speak to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that the order was taken but never completed ! So what can we do I ask and I’m told that the agent is going to speak to his manager . After talking to his manager he is told they can do nothing . So I have asked for the PAK code for that account and I’m going to take my business else where .Then I ask for them to cancel the extra sim that was ordered at the same time as the up grade which they can’t do because that has also not been completed and until they complete I can’t cancel . so now we are in total limbo as to what is happening. The one thing I do know is that after 20+ years with Vodaphone they are a complete waste of time & I’m done with them,0

"I have had a terrible experience with Vodafone UK. Despite paying for the fastest internet package, I constantly face issues with connectivity and speed. To make matters worse, my monthly bill was increased due to mistakes made by one of their branch staff on my account.When the product was sold to me, I was misled about its details. When I tried to cancel my contract after realizing this, they refused, leaving me stuck in a frustrating situation. For months, I have been dealing with ongoing stress and what feels like a kind of trauma caused by their unprofessional service and lack of support.I have repeatedly tried to seek help to resolve my issues, but I’ve found no professional or effective assistance. I’m tired of calling and asking for help, only to get nowhere. I feel completely trapped in my contract and am counting down the days until it ends.I cannot wait to be free from this awful service. I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on my experience.",0
"I have been using a Vodafone SIM card under contract while working at East Croydon Station, and the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts and a SIM swap, the internet connection and network coverage remain non-existent. As a self-employed black cab driver, I rely heavily on mobile apps and internet access for my work, and this issue has severely impacted my ability to operate.For the past four months, I have sent emails to Vodafone's customer service and technical team every month, but have not received any response. Additionally, I have been calling customer service every week, sometimes twice a week, but they have not been able to fix the problem.When I requested to end the contract, which runs until June 2025, Vodafone insisted on a cancellation fee of £180. This is unacceptable considering the consistent lack of service. If you're considering signing a contract with Vodafone, think very carefully. In my experience, the service has been unreliable, and the support unhelpful.Save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable options.",0
Possibly the biggest wast of time I’ve spent in my 72 years with multiple phone calls to and from Vodafone. Placed an order for fast fibre in July 24 and cancelled it today as I’m completely fed up with waiting for engineers to turn up and apologetic calls excusing the reason why they didn’t.ABSOLUTE DISGRACEAVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!It really doesn’t help that the call centres are mainly abroad and I can’t understand a word!!!,0

"Switched to Vodafone as they were offering 4x faster broadband than my previous provider for less than £2 more per month. They sent out a router ahead of the installation date, which I requested to be diverted to my local post office so I could collect when I'm not at work. I got an email to say it had been delivered on Monday, so I went to the post office, only to find that it hadn't actually been delivered, and my parcel was on its way back to Vodafone. When I contacted Vodafone on Tuesday, they said they would try and get a replacement to me by the end of the week. Openreach installed the line on Thursday, it's now the following Monday and I'm still without a router.",0

"We opted for Full Fibre on 01.11.2024 and needed a full installation as previous copper line had been disconnected prior to our house purchase. After carefully reading up on Vodafone's installation process they said a prearranged date for installation would be agreed and a home owner would need to be present to discuss where the box would be installed. Meanwhile, in between our organised date we noticed a box had been installed on our house right near our front door. From that moment everything went from bad to worse. To cut a very long story short, countless contact with Vodafone's customer services who are either robots or cant speak a word of English we are still no where near being connected let alone getting the box moved on 02.12.2024. The second (first prearranged) visit from the engineer explained that Openreach subcontract the works to two different companies for internal and external installations, they don't even employ their own engineers. If you want to lose countless hours of your precious time, loss of earnings, feel totally frustrated and exasperated by all means go ahead with Vodafone. I would happily have cancelled my contract but I'm too exhausted by it all.",0

Regarding: Samsung Z fold 5I did not have a good experience with customer service because I was told I would get charged to speak to the technical team.So if I booked an appointment with the technical team I would be charged which I have no ideawhy !!The other solution was I send the phone off for repair without me knowing what the situation is with the phone how can I just send it off for repair!!! I requested appointment in store with customer service because you would be waiting for a long time just to be seen and I was told that I would have to walk in and wait and wait until I am seen.they would not assist over the phone because the handset is not in front of them I simply had a storage issue & phone turning off whist using the device.I was looking for something simple answers because I thought it might just be something that can be sorted out in person rather than me having to send this handset off which is so frustrating. Waste of call & cannot hear the person talking as they use bad headsets which makes the voice muffled. Regret being with Vodaphone!,0
Very poor service. I have recently moved to a area that the service checker said has good indoor and outdoor service. When moving into the property I have had no signal inside or out. I have called vodaphone and they have said that they are very sorry but they cannot help me. Seeing as I upgraded in may and am now in a contract till may 2026 and the address that I took the contract out in had great service. I have asked for discount and they have said that I am not eligible seeing as I am in contract. The lady I spoke to said that there is nothing that she can do to help me and it's not a technical problem with anything they just don't have a great service for my postcode hu129qh. Despite the service checker saying otherwise. They do not offer a signal booster.Be careful taking out a contract with this network.,0
"I got a new Apple Watch and Vodafone made it really easy to turn on the extra services for it, which I then decided I didn't want to use so turned it off within a week or so. Two months later they were still billing me for it, and turns out while you can sign up with just a tap in the app, turning it off doesn't actually stop the billing. You have to call them and sit and wait on a line for 20 minutes to request the billing to stop even if you turn it off in the app. That's not OK.",0
"Poor connection - wifi drops daily for years. Customer service is really poor. Their solution to wifi drops, instead of trying to fix it, is to convince you to pay more for upgrading your contract and locking yourself into a longer term with them where they won’t help if you ever experience issues.I’ve had a contract with them for years, and they increase the price year on year but will never discount the price or offer a new contract at a better rate (despite connection issues). Currently I’m paying far more than new customers, so I will be switching and I would not recommend the service to anyone else.",0
"In January this year I had FTTP installed with Vodafone at great stress and inconvenience due to poor installation.This week I decided I wanted to take advantage of the benefits of increased speeds available on FTTP, so I made an order to upgrade from 73mbps to 500mbps.It was due to go live tomorrow 2nd December, but today I got a call from a vodafone call centre employee to say my order has to be cancelled because ""my FTTP connection is not capable of 500mbps"" !!!!!!!!!!!!The whole purpose of FTTP is to enable the connection to go that fast!!!!!!!!So I went through immeasurable amounts of stress and inconvenience with the original swap from copper to FTTP and it was a complete waste of time! RIDICULOUS!I wish I had never moved to Vodafone and will be leaving as soon as I am able to, never to return.An awful experience with a shockingly bad company.",0
Ordered an additional handset to be collected from the store due to having my own business and long working hours. Visited the store up to now 3 times to collect and due to the systems been down at the hull St stephens store the manager could not release it. Not only could she not release it but you only have 7 days to collect it and she couldn't extend that time as after 7 days of them having it they automatically send it back regardless of this issue been their issue. They would not allow me to be identified via calling Vodafone and doing it over the phone. The managers attitude was just cancel it if you don't want it. ! I do want it! She repeatedly said that and repeatedly said how she was annoyed with the systems not working but showed no empathy or sympathy for the 30 miles round trip I was making each time. On top if this she could nit offer a home delivery in any way . Also when visiting the next day there was still no computers working and the younger man in charge was even worse with attitude and costumer service. There was either no will to even try and no problem solving skills within the team even when I said why don't they take my I'd scan it now and then send out to me she waved her hands about and said no. The guy today said its against the law! Which it isn't. He said he would be fired but his attitude was just worse in his facial expressions. He didn't want to deal with anything and when I said well can I have a phone call to say your up and running again as the next time I come will be 4 times of 30 mile round trips..he stated look I don't know how many miles you do and I will take your number but can't guarantee anyone is going to call you! When I asked why that was..he said because it's not up to me to get someone else and I cannot make someone else do it if I'm not here. The systems and processes are ridiculous and Vodafone do not care about customer experience. Big company low quality service!,0

When I couldn’t understand what he said, I asked him to repeat it, but he still spoke quickly. then I asked if he could slow down, and he sighed loudly, which felt very rude. whats your problem?I told him that if he didn’t want to help me, he could ask another colleague to take over. Instead, he left me on the line without saying anything, and I could still hear the noisy background. When I tried asking if he was there, he didn’t respond. After a while, I was suddenly put on hold with music playing.I had my recording with this!  do you want to hear how you treat your customers like that? This is truly the first time I have encountered such service even in other countries or other customer services,  with absolutely no basic respect at all.Is this how your company treats customers? I’ve always had a good impression of Vodafone—the staff in stores and the online chat team have been polite and helpful—but this was a terrible experience. I can’t imagine how an elderly customer or someone else who isn’t fluent in English would feel in this situation. It’s not unreasonable to ask someone to speak more clearly or repeat themselves when the background is noisy.Thankfully, my third call was a completely different experience. A different woman answered, and she was so patient and polite. She spoke clearly, and there was no background noise at all. She listened carefully and helped me solve my problem. I really appreciate her professionalism and effort. If every customer service agent were like her, this company would be so much better.I hope you take this feedback seriously. Bad service like the second call can drive loyal customers away, but good service like the third call makes people want to stay.Thank you.",0
Was with Vodafone for 20+ years offered me trade in for my old fone then decided my old fone was broke and wouldnt pay up. Have just left Vodafone after contract ended and back to using fone allegedly broke(not). Would never go back so take no notice of theirtrade in offers.,0
"Enrolled millions of customer with Good Friday rewards campaign. Now for nearly 3 months no good rewards. Keep on putting win a gift card,    Which is never claimable. I got my whole family of 4 into Vodafone contracts and now regretting. Can’t wait to get out when contract ends. Even once a month Broadband reward is now so poor. On top of it hike the prices each April",0
"I have horrendous reception with Vodaphone in 90% of the country, spoke to an advisor wand swapped sim into another phone and great reception, asked for a replacement phone (mine is iPhone 15) to be told can’t exchange even though faulty. Will NEVER use vodaphone ever again and will advise friends, family and customers not to touch with a barge pole",0
"900mb broadband with average speeds of 300mb. I was told by the engineer who fitted it my speeds were low and to contact vodaphone to fix it. Have tried this and constantly met with a brick wall. They refuse to believe the engineer who fitted the broadband. 1 year down the line and the best speed I've had is less than half what I'm paying for. Terrible company, I'm looking at legal action now to rectify.In response to their answer : sorry but do you think I'm stupid? Do you really think I would write this review without running speed tests and doing everything your customer service adviser asked me to do? Your own tool says there is a problem but your adviser wouldn't  believe it. He told me it would fix itself....",0
DO NOT BUY i brought a referbished phone from here had minor cosmetic damages (which i was ok with) but had a faulty camra meaning my camra does not work i took the phone back to them and they said i could send it in to be fixed but i need my phone for work and daily use or if i spent £80 they could fix it within a day since money is tight i decided to continue my life with no camra DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY PLEASE,0
"Shocking experience when ordering new broadband.  Despite having an order in place and confirmed install date, Vodafone did not turn up on the day and had no record of the order despite sending me a contract and taking payment details. They also contacted sky to organise the switch but still denied the order was in place. Vodafone then took a u turn when I provided all the evidence of the order. Due to the shockingly bad customer service, we have cancelled our order.",0
Disappointed with customer service people logged into my ok apparently cos location might of picked up Enfield London miles away and Peterborough miles away and carnt locate money come out my account either,0
"My Google pixel 8 bought 10 months ago has the dreaded white line down the screen. It’s a well known fault and all over the internet but my local Vodafone shop has told me I must have dropped it and they want nothing to do with it. My Dad was with them since 1984 and never had an issue until they told him they weren’t interested in his iPhone issue, so he moved to EE, have I got to do the same?",0
"RIP OFF SCAM!I am OUT OF Contract with them. I have NO commitment to them OR TO THEIR COMPANY POLICY. So....I called and instructed them to cease their service to me as I am moving to Florida. I was told the WILL continue for 30 days after and on from my instruction to stop.I explained in clear tones that they CANNOT FORCE me to take their service. Their operator said that it is company policy. I made it clear that I am not subject to their company policy and should they continue to provide a service having been instructed to cease, I will not pay them especially as I will have moved to Florida. FORCING PEOPLE TO USE THEIR SERVICES.. DISGUSTING!!See their dimwitted reply. Still insisting they can FORCE their service on us. Their policies are for them and I an not one of them.... Clearly I am NOT subject to your policies. You make it clear that because other suppliers (doubtless with their own policies designed to meet with their own requirements and not designed as a cover for Vodafone to use to slither behind while attempting to rip off ex-customers) do it therfore it is OK for you to do It. That's like a child saying ""well all the other kids do it so that makes it OK for me to do it""People are NOT subject to your policies and once out of contract with you people are actually not subject to your contract either. I do hope people are reading this and taking note of your attempts at FORCING me to use your service after you were told that you are no longer required so cease and desist.I felt sorry for your agent who had to tell me her manager couldn't speak to me because he had gone out. When I responded by saying I didn't believe that old canard and more likely her manager told her that she is an agent getting paid to deal with calls, so deal with it by herself. She didn't deny it.So....you think it is good customer service for your managers to not come and help your customer who is clearly not satisfied with your agent's help?You think it creates a good impression that your managers are out rather than doing the job of supporting their agents and indeed customers?Why didn't the assistant manager come to help?Supervisor maybe? Hmm?RIP OFF!!NB... We are not on first name terms. The correct form of address is ""sir"".",0
"I ordered Vodafone in hope that they will provide good service, however their service is as awful as it can get. They could not install me on the date provided. They did the internals but not the externals. While doing the internals their engineer drilled through my gas and water line. I tried complaining it to Vodafone but the answer I got that it was Openreach engineer and I have to claim compensation with Openreach. Vodafone cannot provide me any solution. I tried explaining to the agent that I have not ordered from openreach. My service provider is Vodafone and Vodafone should look into the it but they provided no solution as Openreach is their installation contractor. I sat in my house in this cold without water or heating till late night. When I insisted the agent on call told me he has registered my complaint and someone from Vodafone will contact me but no one contacted from Vodafone. After a week someone turned up and replaced the damaged pipe. No clue when someone will come to fix the broadband and do the external work. Everyday I get a text message saying someone will call me within an hour but no one ever did.  The service is appalling—avoid Vodafone if you value your peace of mind. It's truly disgraceful.",0
"Everything they could get wrong they did. New customer cancelled my order without notification. Left me without internet. Set up a new contract not at the agreed deal but max pricing. Terminated my contract again on agreement asked me to switch to another supplier. I switched to Sky, Vodaphone cancelled the transfer, I am not seen as an existing customer for Sky and can't get a new customer deal. Third supplier now to get onto the internet. I cancelled with the 14 days, they want to charge me Termination fees. Communication is awfull, the chat box is useless, to get to a human takes ages, you get to different departments, I have had sales, engineering, termination, accounts. My life has been waisted for the last three weeks trying to have conversations with them to sort there problems out.I am sure if it goes through normally you will be ok but if you have any problems god forbid your time and engery will be sucked out of you.",0
"What an absolutely shocking company to deal with. Ordered broadband router arrived very quickly. At 00.17 on the day of the engineer appointment received an unintelligible voicemail. Then took all that morning talking to robots to eventually learn that the “backend team” whatever that is, had cancelled the order. Left with no connection whatsoever as bt connection cancelled at midnight. I was going to have this installed at my own home but after the fiasco at my employers house not a chance. It’s beyond shocking and polite language will not let me express how I really feel. AVOID.",0
"Been stuck with 6mbps download for over a year, asked repeatedly what's going on, why is it so slow, but I was always brushed off saying it's within expected range or something. just switched to a different provider and they told me on day 1 of installation that the line is damaged outside and that inside the house the signal is being split to multiple sockets and that's splitting the speed, in one day they found two seperate fults and im now on 15mbps download instead of 6 and waiting for the line to be replaced in a few weeks. And if that wasn't enough I told Vodafone I wanted to cancel in October not now Ive had to pay £22 for an additional month because whoever I spoke to couldn't be bothered actually doing her job and canceling my contract, now I've been told I have to pay £22 so in 22 days my final bill will be ready and they will refund the £22 i just payed ?? What a stupid system. The chat bot is utter rubbish disconyme after the ordeal of trying to sort all this out for over an hour and a half !! Will never use Vodafone again. TOTAL RUBBISH!!!!!!",0
"Not honest service, disrespectful to elderly.They make business contracts for the elderly without asking their opinion against their wish. Those people never had a business when they used to work and currently, they are pensioners. The people pay a very high price mostly using for calls and texts.They take payments from direct debits twice a month instead of once a month.I have had a humiliating experience with Ipswich Vodaphone.I have used their service for two months but they charged me three times.I left them in March before April  I didn't want to pay an expensive price for hardly using their dater.With my family, we use only WhatsApp calls and messages.Without shame, they applied to TredUnion as I didn't pay for 4-5 months.Their dishonesty and greed make me feel sick.I am not the only person who is disappointed, I know other people as well.",0
"Vodafone is the worst network provider. It transmits a very low-quality signal to my house. I need to move rooms to locate a signal to make a call. When I contacted, they informed me that I had a poor connection in my home area and advised me to enable home wifi for phone calls. When I indicate I want to cancel, their early termination cost exceeds the whole value of the remainder of my contract. Totally untrustworthy business. The most costly source, the lowest quality, and they never take responsibility for cancellation. I am paying more money to obtain better service than the other providers, but I am receiving really poor service while paying more. Not fair. I will never use Vodafone and never recommend it to my friends. And will inform anybody about their unjust corporate policy. I can't believe their answer is to make calls using my home wifi as a provider.",0
"I’ve been a loyal Vodafone customer for over 20 years and have always valued their excellent service – with one major exception: the network coverage around Oxford, Abingdon, and Witney is extremely poor. It’s never been great, but over the past couple of years, it has become significantly worse.I’ve contacted Vodafone numerous times to resolve this issue. At first, I was told the weak signal was due to maintenance work. Once that was completed, there was no improvement. I then reset my phone settings as advised, but the problem persisted. Finally, I was told that if I was unhappy, I could terminate my contract without penalty.This isn’t just my issue; I know other Vodafone users in the area who face the same challenges. It’s frustrating to be unable to make calls or constantly get disconnected.Hoping to escalate the matter, I emailed the CEO, Max Taylor, as I felt he should be made aware that customers are being told their only solution is to leave Vodafone. Unfortunately, my email never reached him as all communications are intercepted and dealt with by a team of senior customer service officers  – I was informed that he only sees summaries of complaints, and there are no plans to improve coverage in this area.Vodafone’s response to long-standing customers like me is disappointing. Customers deserve better than being advised to switch providers instead of having their concerns addressed. Surely this is not a good business model.I hope Vodafone’s leadership reconsiders both their approach to network improvements and their customer complaints process and that those at the top of the organisation are not protected by an impenetrable layer in the tiers below.Reply to Vodafone response to my post:My point was that it is impossible to get through the customer service barrier to the CEO and there is no plan to improve network coverage - NOT just in my immediate local area. I see no point in going on Facebook or Twitter. I don’t need a conversation, just action.",0
I moved from payg to pay monthly 13th of November. I’m still waiting to move to pay monthly? I keep getting people on the chat or over the phone who don’t know how everything works? I’m going to a Vodafone store tomorrow to try and get some sort of confirmation of what I need to do to get a temporary number so I can move to pay monthly? Veryo frustrating when people on Vodafone don’t want to help you.,0
"Just a terrible company! Rejecting an application for not meeting the ""criteria"" yet refusing to state the criteria required. I have a stable job, great credit score, good income. It seems like what you are actually saying is ""Oops, you found a deal which is too good value, our mistake. We can't allow you to have it, let's reject your application and mess up your credit score"". Joke of a company. I will be going to the Ombudsman as this is ridiculous to reject someone and not tell them despite their credit score and credit limit being extremely good, never missed a single payment in my life, always pay in full. Just ridiculous.",0
"Mobiles.co Were greatUnfortunately the Vodafone airtime contract wasn't.Vodafone refused to let me carry my old 2 year Vodafone contract number, this despite the old two year contract ending.They said that as I had got my Phone and contract from a third party and not.Vodafone directly they refused to allow me to keep my Number.When I rung Vodafone they said that had I bought the phone from them there would have been no issue and the number would have been ported in a couple of days, seems like Bullying to me.However and of course the same phone from Vodafone was 8 pound a month more expensive disgusting treatment from Vodafone.Needless to say I cancelled both contracts on the spot.Mobiles .co were Brilliant, Vodafone are tripe..",0
"They failed to notify my broadband provider when they took over the line,  which meant I was charged for both.  They tried to tell me it was my fault,  and just made stuff up. Over 3 hours on the phone, transferred 6 times and it's still not sorted.  An absolute shambles of a company.Update:Text exchanges with 10 different people who all failed to acknowledge what the web site says is not what happened. I asked the same question eight times and they ignored it every time.",0
Service and staff are terrible. when i called customer service to transfer broadband to a new address spoke to a horrible staff. he had a very bad accent and spoke very fast which made it hard to understand. i asked him to speak louder slower or speak more clearly and he got angry and then he started doing tricks that wasted my time on the phone which cost me a lot of money for the call (about 1 hour and 45 minutes call). he kept asking me a question and put me on hold for a few minutes like that I don't remember how many times he put me on hold. i asked him to stop this antics but he continued. he was trying to make things difficult for me. i asked to speak to the manager but he wouldn't connect me to the manager and told me to wait for the manager to call back. i waited but no call back. would not recommend anyone to Vodafone and will never go to vodafone again.,0
"Always been with BT who are very reliable but too expensive so wanted to give Vodafone a go and i regret my decision. 24h from the activation day the router just died completely so was left without broadband for more than 3 days and had to drive to work from the office. When the new router arrived, the speeds have been fluctuating so much. At times instead of the contract 150Mbs i got around 1Mbs in the evening and and now while working in the morning between 3 and 45Mbs of download speed. Thankfully i’m still in a 14 day cooling off period to switch to Sky. What’s worse is i’m in Newbury where the Vodafone headquarters are and i get even worse service! It is also not very clear what number to call when there are issues and you need to use their awful chat service which slows things down.",0

"I tried to renew by broadband / landline , to a better deal after vodaphone had hiked up the charges after years of being a customer and my circumstances had changed after my wife’s accident she had become totally disabled, at first 3rd October a representative of the company said they can offer a better deal and we would be put on it with a 24month contract, several months latter I found this had just not happened , I called again they said I should have been put on it and they have a record of it and they will put me on the new deal now ( perhaps a Indian call Center where I feel sorry for the staff who had limited English language skills more staff training is required)  , but I will loose out financially from October the 3rd until now . I’ve just found out this had still not been resolved, I’m still paying the high rate , This is basically fraud on vodaphone part , I’d recommend anyone reading this to avoid vodaphone as there customer service is none existent, there’s no complaints E mail mail !! And the only customer service I’m getting now is a useless chat Bot . The only way to complain is post !!! So please Guys if you are reading this and you are thinking of switching to vodaphone as a broadband provider think again , it’s not worth the hassle, !I’m going to have another few hours of my time wasted by them today , but ultimately the I suspect the final solution is to change providers.One very disappointed customer,James Thompson",0
"Rotten to the core,  this company just keeps on lying and feeding you misinformation, starting with the salesman in the great yarmouth shop, assuring me I could cancel anytime before next payment due several times,it turns out a lie there's a 30day cancellation period, next lie chap on phone when canceling contract.told me I'd be charged £18 but they'd probably take the £37 monthly charge a refund the difference .they took the £37 not seen the refund. Also he didn't cancel the  contract  next lie a woman on the phone a month later assured me the contract was cancelled, another lie. The next lie was from  the social media team who told me it's sorted and the are waiting for the final bill on the 23rd November and would reach out to me on the 24th to check all is correct, as its now the 29th November I can only assume that's another lie . This has been going on for  4 months now, they have even had debt collectors chasing me for non existing debts, they  admit I don't owe anything but their attitude is opps sorry.

"Yet again, their broadband goes down and they do nothing to help.The amount of time there is a service outage with their broadband is ridiculous, and they provide no compensation. Only after two full days they will even think of providing you with compensation. But for most of us who rely on Internet to work from home, waiting two days for connectivity to be fixed and then be compensated for it is absolutely ridiculous.As soon as my contract finishes, i am moving to another provider.

Rang Vodafone to express my dissatisfaction and all they said if cancel then I’ll have to pay for the rest of the contract.

"Vodafone took all my data, cancelled my current provider, carried out a credit check and quite unjustifiably refused my application. My credit ratings vary from 578 to 979 from Equifax to Experian. The difference? I don't use a credit card or apply for credit. I appealed against Vodafone's decision providing financial details and background but was turned down again. First time in 86 years!! Or maybe it's my age!Vodafone Social Media responded to my comment, see below. Firstly. they cannot have known how I felt failing a credit check for the first time in my life at 86 years of age. Secondly, whoever wrote this ignored that I had already filed an ""appeal"" and been again rebuffed. What should I expect from another appeal - further indignity? If this is Vodafone's attitude I am happy that I was saved from any further exposure to their arrogance. I now know why Vodafone get so many negative comments for their customer service!

I ordered full fibre to the premises on 6th November. My install date was yesterday 27th November. Having had my old copper calling removed and all the necessary fibre installed. I was told that the Openreach connection on the pole outside hadn't been activated . Having spoken to Vodafone they are telling me the earliest Openreach can look at this is the 5th December. I now have no phone line or broadband. Despite informing Vodafone I have a daughter who has a disability and it is essential I am able to contact her. They said there is nothing they can do. My mobile phone does not work from my home 90 % of the time. So I don't  really know what to do. I did ask Vodafone if they could supply a dongle but they said no. Given I was bombarded with text messages regarding the installation I would have thought Vodafone would have checked there was a viable connection in place.Order number: WEB-0001000041337817Messaged Vodafone as requested.Nothing they can do.,0
"Was with Vodafone for over 10 years. 8 years ago they messed up 2 direct debits which went down as missed payments on my credit file, I didn't complain, just one of those things. Upgraded many times, sometimes with phones, sometimes SIM only. Never needed to call them, never thought to complain when I had grounds to, never missed a payment by my own doing. My new quote for SIM only (because they didn't have the phones I wanted) was £4 more a month than my old SIM and for fewer Gb data each month. Found a black Friday deal for the phone I wanted with ID Mobile. But because my current contract didn't end until 9/12/24, a little over a week from today, I was getting an early termination charge. I brought all this up and mentioned how unfair I thought it was, but that went unheard.Update. Yesterday's reply was a waste of time. I followed their link only to be told the couldn't do anything. An absolute waste of time and energy. They couldn't look in to anything as they explained they would. A very frustrating interaction with them.",0

"Having decided to move to Vodafone broadband to save money and to improve speed, the whole process turned into a complete debacle.  Once I had signed up I was inundated with emails and texts, initially from Vodafone, and then from British Telecom.  In the main these texts kept confirming the date and time when a BT engineer would call at my house to install the fibre connection.  This was an afternoon in November (between 1pm and 6pm).  I kept being reminded that, if I failed to keep the appointment, I could be penalised.  I made a special trip to my house (as I was staying with a friend on that day) and arrived in good time on the date scheduled.  And I waited, and I waited,  At 16:16 I received a text from BT to say my engineer, Daniel, was on site.  Well, he patently wasn't but I presumed the message might mean he was at the local junction box, a mile away.  6pm came and went and still no sign of Daniel at my house, and no more text updates.  I tried sending messages to that text number with no success.  So, then I rang Vodafone who would not talk to me because I could not recall my security pin number, which I had recorded on my laptop that I did not have with me.  At 9pm I returned to my friend's.  For communication companies, Vodafone and BT are completely without a clue when it comes to keeping their customer updated.  BT rang me the following morning, and the reason Daniel had not turned up at my house to do the job he was supposed to do was... it had got dark!  What?  Dark?  In mid-November at gone 4pm?  What a surprise.  I cancelled my contract with Vodafone and then received another text to say the company had credited my account with £12 and a few pence to compensate me because my broadband had not gone live when it should.  Clueless, hopeless customer service and no email to send my complaint to - just a useless chatbot, TOBi, a postal address, and customer service agents unable to help me on the night I was awaiting the engineer because my security code was elsewhere.",0

We call them again, they literally just aren't doing anything I've actually never seen anything like it. It's completely insane. Our broadbands on vodafone and he's been on vodafone for literal years I don't get it lolUpdate: I reached out to instagram as recommended by the below response, they just keep asking me for my name and details and saying sorry and nothing ever gets fixed.

Worst customer service ever!! Rang them up to say I will not be renewing my contract or upgrading with them and to finish my contract! Received text messages after saying we're sorry to see you go and so on.. but now I have rang them up again to find out they have said there is no cancellation request! So I will be getting billed again the next month. Bloody useless fools just send you round in circles and can't do their jobs properly!,0
"Trying to interact with customer service is incredibly challenging. I've been trying to leave since April, but have been getting charged monthly since then. Interactions with the chat bot are excruciating, and once I'm through to a human they just pass me around between teams, no one seems to know what's going on or remembers anything. All I've been trying to do for months is get a refund. Incredibly poor experience.",0

"I was deeply disappointed with Vodafone's handling of my broadband move. At my old address, I enjoyed 900 Mbps speeds, but at my new address, the maximum speed they could offer was only 80 Mbps—a drastic downgrade. Despite this, they refused to waive the early termination fee, even though they failed to provide a comparable service. It’s incredibly frustrating that Vodafone penalizes customers for moving to areas they cannot properly service. Their lack of flexibility and unwillingness to support loyal customers is unacceptable.",0
Getting lied to by one of the workers to start with so now I am stuck in a two year contract with a useless provider I don't want to be with. I was charged over 304 pound because there staff cannot do there job properly.The phone they have provided I have had nothing but issues with. I hardly get any signal with this phone and they promised to do something about it but never did. They have an excuse for everything. All I wanted was the money I am owed because they have overcharged me but no I have to settle for a credit on an account I want to leave.Being brutally honest it is a piss poor company with even worse customers service.,0
"Locked in an unwanted contractHad a plan with VOXI, which was terminated only 48 hours after my payment bounced back due to a credit card being stolen and replaced. Only 48 hours after this, my plan was cancelled against my will, and I wasn’t given the chance to reactivate it. I was told I would need to create an entirely new contract, now with Vodafone. I specifically told the agent online that I didn’t want to have a fixed contract and didn’t want to leave VOXI, simply wanted to pay for the missing payment, but I was told that this option was not available. I asked about the benefits of the new plan and it looked like a similar plan with more benefits for the same price. Until it wasn’t. Despite mentioning more than once that I didn’t want to be locked in a contract, my request not respected. A month into my contract and Vodafone has proven to be worse in every way. Higher and more frequent charges. My plan is supposedly larger, and yet I unexplainably run out of MG much faster. Conveniently, the company charges an outrageous amount to add more MB.Today I got in touch with them, to find out that I am locked into a 24-month contract against my will. Despite stating I didn’t want a fixed plan, the agent who assisted me went ahead and selected that plan. I was told that I will need to pay a cancelation fee that costs over £200 if I want to cancel my plan. I will continue to inform people online about this and file a complaint with citizens advice, so they can look into the messages exchanged between myself and the agent. In the meantime, I am living a true nightmare. Beware!!",0
Not a disabled-friendly company. It is difficult talk with them and they have a messy voice talking expecting a disabled to insert number or else.,0
Had a very bad experience today. We visited today for sim replacement but workers busy with taking each other including manager mr.sid… they are unprofessional and misguiding the customers,0
"I'm spending hours speaking with customer services trying to fix several issiues, like bad service and network (London mostly) and mostly VAT invoicing, no one can tell me where I can find VAT invoicing (some of the advisors don't understand why is it for so I have to give a lecture of what is VAT ) every 3 months I have to call them (every VAT submission)  and try to get some information, today once I asked to speak with the manager who might be able to help me regarding this issue my call was disconected. They send me the bill that don't have VAT number on it and at the bottom of it it states - This is not VAT invoice. I don't think is legal to charge VAT and not issue an invoice for it? Can enyone help me with my issiue?",0
When I joined Vodafone there was an offer for a tablet which I did not receive. When I call I was told they will send me a link in November last year and I can use  to collect from amazon. Up till now no link no tablet. The worst part of joining Vodafone is I have Vodafone Wires which was put there by them hanging in front of my house and when I called them today the customer service agent told me to look for a local engineer and pay them to do it. So I still have Vodafone wires hanging in front of my house. Internet Sometimes not great at night.I have started looking for a new provider to leave Vodafone after my call to them today.,0
"Had their Broadband installed. Please do not go with these.Absolutely terrible.They make the old copper internet look fast and reliable.The Hub, well not a good word can be said about it.Have to keep powering it off, to get it to work.Please avoid for your sanity",0
"Very me rewards is not rewarding, been a lifelong customer and have never won or received anything, it's a wind up and a waste of time, makes me want to cancel every time I see, Sorry not this time, total rubbish and insulting to loyal customers.",0
The guy on the chat line was the most unhelpful guy ever. I gave him my new sim pay monthly order number which I received from Vodafone but he wouldn’t accept this number? I’ll just go to Vodafone store. What a waste of time the chat line is.,0
Avoid this legal scammers. Vodafone is a total Scam. They even try to rip off the customers more by one more month at the end of contract.,0
"Not recommended - please avoid at any cost.Monday 25/11 city fiber engineers installed the fiber box - excellent job, but Vodafone was snd is terrible with setting everything up. Now no internet 26/11 and speaking with advisor AGAIN (3rd time now) been advised there won't be an internet for at least 24h again.Even I explained I am working from home and I need an internet for this purpose, I just been ignored! So now I have to pay for internet service which I don't have, expenses for travel more then 40 miles to the office as cannot work from home and also wasted my time contacting the vodafone support team so many times and wnswering the same useless information like what's is my account number, router number, what my issue?Also, when spoke with advisor on 25/11 I been promised that the internet will apear in 2h, now after 24h I been told I need to wait at least 24h more!",0
Painful customer service.,0
"Ordered broadband, worst customer experience ever! Poor communication and did not understand my issue. Passed on to different advisers repeating the same information! They do not know what they are doing, online chat the worst I've experienced.  Swiftly cancelled the order, awful initial service! AVOID.",0
"I switched to Vodafone several years ago and quickly regretted it. The customer service is abysmal. I've been on hold for hours, transferred countless times, and received little to no help with my billing issues. Their online portal is a nightmare to navigate, and it's impossible to find the information you need.The billing itself is a mess. I've been over charged for services I never signed up for, and despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue, it's still ongoing.Just today my phone was resctricted.Vodafone seems more interested in making money than providing good customer service.I can't recommend them to anyone.",0
VODAFONE ARE USELESS!!My phone number was ported to another provider in August 2024. 4 months later I am still being sent bills for a phone plan that is now with EE.Customer services are useless.I have spoken to 4 sets of customer service advisors and they say they have sorted it and then low and behold another bill at the end of the month.When you click on their link for an email - it doesn't work.The phone number they give you to complain is now out of service.Just a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Overcharged and illegally put on a business tariff?I have never had a bill that is correct ever since I upgraded my phone, also it says I'm on a business tariff when I not a business, I am employed....shambles...id love someone to actually help me sort this out.",0
"I switched to Vodafone broadband from another provider. They advertised that they offer up to £100 credit to cover early contract termination fees.Firstly, the offer is deceptively worded. It is not up to £100. Later I found it was only up to £25. Then they expect me to fill in a form to claim the £25. I did this and it was rejected. I sent them the bill from my previous provider, but it wasn't enough for them. And I sent them my bank statement showing the leaving fee I had to pay. Still not enough. They have me running around in circles trying to claim £25 that I'm entitled to.",0
Customer service is non existent and the staff are the most unhelpful I have ever come across.  Spoke to one advisor you assured me he would call back but unfortunately never did and also did not put any notes on account regarding discussions.  Phoned Vodafone again and I had to go through the whole process again.  Tried to make a complaint unfortunately was unable to.   Vodafone make it very difficult to upgrade!!!!,0
I am not happy with the service nearly 72 hours I have been waiting for my WiFi to connect clearly lies when I was told up to 24 hours not 72 hours not happy with the service,0
"To anyone considering a switch to Vodafone, I urge you…DONT! I recently switched to Vodafone after 8 years with EE for a better deal - a week later and I’m switching back. Terrible mobile data connection, dreadful service, the only saving grace about Vodafone is their customer service. I’ve never left an online review for anything before, but I felt I had to share my poor experience with Vodafone to put anyone else off making the same mistake I did.DO NOT JOIN VODAFONE THEY’RE POOR!!",0
Still waiting for a call that I was promised 2 weeks ago,0
Ensure you cancel your contract after your contract has expired. Had to pay 2 months extra after my so called contract expired. Complete joke!,0
"Scandalous customer service.Every time I call their customer service, you can guarantee I’ll be on the call for at least an hour !!!Very very poor service being passed from operator to operator and STILL not getting my issue dealt with.Issue was cancelling my contract.  Gave 30 days notice and STILL had to pay another 2 months worth of service.Was told to call back and claim refund.No chance. Have got more to do with my time than hanging on the phone for an eternity.Will NEVER use Vodafone again.",0
Bad experienceI Lost 1 hourtime for nothingNot recommendBad idea to go A Brixton  branch,0
"I was compelled to purchase their tracker service for insurance purposes.Firstly, it's rubbish. So many false alarms. Secondly, they are impossible to contact.Finally, with 6 months remaining when I sold my car, no refunds for the remainder - not an inconsiderable sum!",0
Having moved over from Virgin Media the initial move for the broadband went well. But the phone line took a couple of days as expected But the new digital phone line will only let you answer calls from mobiles or other digital lines. Anyone using an old analogue line get number unavailable tone. Customer services have been called every day and after 10 days it is still not working. Awful product and service.,0
"I have an ongoing complaint with Vodafone that I still have not got resolved. Every person I speak to says that they are going to follow up and get this resolved for me but they never doComplaint reference 573844All I want to do is upgrade my wife's handset. That's it!In store can't do itOver the phone can't do itCan't do it onlineCan't do it in appIts taken well over 2 weeks and I'm loosing all patience now!!I have spoke to 4 different complaints handlers and each person promises me the world and never follow through with what they say they are going toFirst person didn't call me back and I was passed on to someone else. The notes they had on the system were a joke and had to explain the full situation again!Exactly the same thing happened a 2nd and 3rd time. Notes are horrific and takes me forever to explain the issue. All I want to do is upgrade my handset!There is an issue with my account and I understand things to wrong, I am a patient guy however this is beyond a jokeThe main thing frustrating me is the false promises. Advisors tell me they are going to do something and they never do! It's downright rude!! And quite frankly I'm sick of itLast advisor told me they expect this to be resolved by the weekend and they would call me back if it wasn't.It's now 1.52pm on Monday afternoon which to me is after the weekend!I have written an email to CEO max Taylor. I am hoping the email reaches him because I have had enoughIf a manager can see this and do something about it I suggest they do. I am giving it till the end of the week before I contact the ombudsman!The service is a joke",0
VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!Their reception in London is awful and their customer service and web applications continually have issues. I suggest you chose any other provider as Vodafone are next to useless!!!,0
The most consumer unfriendly service.Just to be able to log in to my account I needed to contact customer service 5 times. Each time it took awful amount of time.Why is it so difficult for vodafone to do something that is automated by other providers?! Dreadful.,0
Went into the Blackburn Vodaphone shop in the Mall  was put off straight away not one employee made eye contact or welcomed you into store very rude. There was no clear area people were queuing when I asked for help I was looked at like an alien zero customer service. I had been told to go into the store by Vodaphone online to collect sim cards for two contracts which we had not received in the official order. The whole thing was a shambles and the way in which we where dealt with was rude and unhelpful. Due to this we have now cancelled both contracts and would not use Vodaphone again. Good luck to any using this store unless they get further training in how to deal with customers & make customers feel welcome your best ging else where. There was a elderly gentleman in their on his own I felt sorry for him I could see he wasn't getting anywhere and they didn't want to go the extra mile to help him. The staff member looked as confused as he did I it was like no one knew what they were doing. I was told I would have to call Vodaphone to order the sims to be posted to our home address yet I was in the Blackburn Vodaphone shop. They told me its separate!! Mind blowing.,0
VODAFONE has gotta be the most useless 😤 phone company in Britain even worser than KCON! I wanted Broadband OPENREACH said my number couldn't be ported to VODAFONE! VODAFONE then got a CROMER 012635 number and tried to put that on HOLT EXCHANGE it didn't work and I got nothing as I've CEASED my mobile with them and I've now got everything with BT EE and I've saved myself a fortune! Don't waste your time with VODAFONE they are a PARASITE LIKE KCON so call BT and do as I did I've dumped VODAFONE and ill never use their 💩 service again!,0
"Wish there was a zero stars option! I’ve been waiting for over3 months for a full refund of £189.08! Despite making 3 phone calls, and being told 3 times that the money would be refunded to my bank account in approx 7-10 days, over 3  months later and still nothing! Talk about “Easy Switch” this has been absolutely nothing short of an absolute nightmare, do not use these cowboys for your home broadband, they over promise and under deliver. If you wait in all day for connection, trust me, they will not turn up, nor will they let you know that they’re not turning up! Then they will arrange with you a different date to come connect you, you will wait in all day for them to turn up, and guess what! You will get another no show! Disgusting behaviour!",0
Have been with them over 2yrs now. Whilst in contract I had no problems.  After contract ended  we have had so many problems with connection keeps dropping out. Every time we check connection they report there are no problems.Time to leave i think.,0
"Ok, you get an email too login in to see the progress of your order. You need a phone number or account number, which you get when the account is live. The best bit is they are aware of this and have done nothing to rectify it.  You need either number above to talk on the phone or to a person via the chatbot.  The reason I was trying to talk  to someone is the router has been posted to the billing address, not the installation address.  WOW.As always reply obviously only read last sentance of my complaint",0
"Very disappointed with Vodaphone upgrade experience, due to collect my new phone, told unable to due to processing error on Vodaphone side. Very unhelpful, Raised complaint with Customer Services told to call store. No one answering the phone. Would not recommend.",0
"It seems that the three months free apple tv depends on whether you have used apple tv before. I received an apple tv dongle through the post and was told I would be provided an email link. After two online chats and a telephone call, I was finally sent a 'unique' link, which wasn't unique at all. It simply told me how to set up apple tv on the apple tv box. Apple do have promotions for new users to get 3 months free, but as soon as I set it up with my apple ID, I was immediately charged the monthly rate. Its frustrating. The broadband is OK at a reasonable price but this sort of thing leaves a sour taste. I appear to have wasted my time with the phone call and the online chats, and want others to know that some of these sweetener freebees are not necessarily what they seem.",0
Very poor I nearly had there broadband but lack of communication and support made me cancel glad I did I'll look elsewhere.,0
Rubbish company. Overcharged me,0
"If i could give 0 stars i would.They blatantly lied to me regarding the package i was signing up for claiming that i would be on a fibre package and despite there being fibre lines in my area they have me on the old copper lines. Furthermore despite ""guaranteeing"" me speeds of 20mb i get 2mbs-3.5mbs at most which i reported on the first bill payment and asked to have it logged for the record. Then when a few months of poor speeds and still paying full bill passed i contacted them to have my contract ended since they lied repeatedly about my line and speeds.I was told i was a liar an that i never made a report of bad speeds in a roundabout way which i feel is more offensive than just saying it. I then made 3 subject access requests, the first was ignored blatantly, the second had the very conversation i requested missing as well as call recordings and other chat logs, the third was fulfilled and proved i was telling the truth. Despite this & the fact they accepted that they had wasted my time and acted disgustingly wretched by calling me a liar they still wont end my contract without me paying for services that havent been provided since billing is in advance & a contract end fee even though they have broke contractual obligations by not putting me on the fibre line like advertised & giving me 10% of the speeds guaranteed, however they're willing to offer me £10 credit as an apology but i still have to pay for services that wasn't given and a contact end fee.By far the most disgusting company i have ever had the displeasure of coming across, i STRONGLY suggest that anyone reading this avoids Vodafone at all cost, they're worse than every other Internet provider I've been with for speeds, customer service & lies.Should any evidence be needed to prove exactly what i have stated for vodafone not to have this comment removed claiming it's a false claim i have the chat logs and all relevant information & log numbers.Oh and don't believe the 5 star AI reviews that Vodafone themselves put up to boost their rating, its just another disgusting tactic they use to fool and lie to customers.",0
"First of all, thank you for your response. However, I would like to point out that if you check my record, you should see that I have already spoken with your Customer Service Team at least twice and expressed my dissatisfaction with your delays. Specifically, when you first informed me that the installation would be postponed to the 28th, I made it very clear to your team that I could only accept the 28th as the latest date and could not tolerate any further delays. This is because it has a significant impact on my work and my entire family’s daily life.However, less than 24 hours later, you informed me of yet another delay, pushing the installation date to December 17. I strongly urge Vodafone to thoroughly review my conversations with your staff before providing any response.",0
"I've had my mobile and broadband with you for a few years now. I've logged on the your website for deals and they are absolutely rubbish. So much cheaper just doing a Google search. Never once have you contacted me to offer me a good deal so I'll go elsewhere. You're not interested in keeping me as a customer so I'm not interested in staying with youUpdateYou messaged me to give me an ""amazing deal"" logged in Pixel 8 £10 upfront and £14 a month....tried to do it nope....I have two months left on my contract so it went to £40 upfront and £24 per month. You have ZERO idea how to keep your customers so off to Three I go.",0
"My relative has been in a care home for a year and has dementia, he has also lost his phone. Consequently, I thought I should cancel his account. I went  into a store and they said they could not help and I should ring their the Vodafone Critical Care team. This I did but again they said they could not do anything without the account holder speaking to them. My relative is not saying much that makes sense now so I'm not sure how that will work! Unless I can cancel they will keep taking his money even though he will not be able to use the account, how is this right?I do not have Power of Attorney so how do we get this resolved? I can give you the care home details and you can ask them.",0
"So here's what happened. I purchased a new eSim from Vodafone as a pay monthly customer through Carphone Warehouse. I also requested a switch to keep my number. Thought I found a good deal, however it was the start of a horrific experience with both carphone warehouse and Vodafone all together. None are better than the other.They've sent me the eSim through post apparently, which beats the logic, since it was supposed to be a ELECTRONIC SIM??? but they still send the QR code through post? Idk, very badly thought. They've used DPD, which again, very bad delivery company to deal with, can't work your way around with them. And because I was at work, they didn't want to deliver a sim card unless in person. Mind you, they got all the way to my flat door, and still didn't slide it through the door, my own address and my own flat, which could've been treated as handed to the resident too. Now they've failed to deliver every day until my old sim provider disconnected my services because of the switch, but the switch was not complete because I wasn't getting the sim to activate it. Multiple rounds of trying to contact Vodafone to sort this out, they were not interest to help me since the contrat was down through carphone warehouse, even if they were the provider. The order number was not Vodafone generated, therefore they didn't do the slightest to help.Back to carphone warehouse, their website is a shamble, a disaster, it's not working to contact them online, and because my phone got disconnected I was unable to make calls. I emailed, but as you guessed no one bothered to answer.So, as a last resort I tried Skype. I had to top up Skype, and was finally able to make a call using the home wife through Skype. The lady from Carphone warehouse customer service could not have been more uninterested to help. I asked her what the problem is, if I can change the delivery to be collected or any other ways. No, it was ""no"" answer to every solution I was trying to find. I couldn't collect, I couldn't change delivery address, she sent me back to Vodafone and told me to go to a store with my ID to ask for a new number. The absolute madness and insanity of this situation was mind-blowing. The immense amount of stress they've caused me by messing up with my Sim was tremendously horrific. I asked carphone warehouse to cancel my order, customer service said she will do it. I asked if I'll get a confirmation of the cancellation to which she said I will, but never received it.I'm in absolute livid state of how incapable the customer service was on both sides, and completely useless to the point of mockery. To make a mistake on your side, and then expect the customer to solve everything and go to all the stores in person to chase you for a sim card. You are all out of your mind for such a disgusting service.Finally, I had to get another contract, this time from O2, who was very easy to deal with. Got a new eSim card in half an our, which was directly installed in my phone, didn't have to do anything. Customer service was 5 stars and assisted me through the whole process even when I couldn't use my phone number to be verified, they found a way around. However I've lost my old number because of Vodafone and its mess.I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WILL USE VODAFONE OR CARPHONE WAREHOUSE AGAIN!!! AVOID AND RUN FAR AWAY WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF THEIR STORES, THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY CLOWNS AND SCAMMERS. NOW I HAVE TO CHASE TJEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO CANCEL MY CONTRACT, AND PASS ME FROM ONE TO ANOTHER TO HAVE IT CANCELLED. ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.",0
"I wouldn’t give it any stars if there was an option!I’ve been a customer since 2019. Initially the service was good now they became one of the worst companies in the UK.Their customer service is extremely poor, incompetent, very rude and reluctant to answer any questions.They are unable to understand the problem and they won’t help. They only keep repeating the same story over and over again without any sense.I’ve spent a significant amount of time on calls with Vodafone customer service without any conclusion. I’ve explained the problem repeatedly and followed all the suggested steps, despite the time and the energy I have invested in these calls the problem remain unresolved.Additionally, I’m paying for a service that doesn’t work, they just taking your money.I’m extremely disappointed with their terrible management, it’s a shame. One of the managers was supposed to call me for a problem I had and when they called they cut the call while I was talking.Ridiculous! If you are thinking to change to Vodafone don’t waste your time!",0
"Almost impossible to work with Vodafone and OpenreachStarted the process to get set up on Vodafone internet in the region now it is being offered alongside installation from openreach. It has now been 2 months since the initial installation date - 1 cancelled engineer apointment, 2 engineers meeting and 1 un-scheduled visit from the engineering team (that I was lucky to be home for) still no internet.It took 2 months for the internet to be not installed for them to raise an escalation to openreach and internally at vodafone after I wanted to complain.Here's the major problem, their complaints team also do nothing! There is no way to talk to openreach directly around the issues that they are facing on the installation of the internet, the agent who is ""assigned"" to my complaint just relays information from openreach.The past 3 calls I have had from vodafone around my complaint were to be told ""we will have to wait until 7 days from now until we know more"". I wait 7 days, and then the next phone call they give me is to give me exactly the same information. ""We're very sorry, nothing we can do, we have been told we have to wait until 7 days from now until we know more"".I feel like I'm going to be stuck in an endless loop with this service until the end of time.I asked for resolution and was told ""well you probably shouldn't go with another provider because you'll have to go through this all again"".Overall - ridiculous. I can't wait to get a message from vodafone about this review just to put me in to another complaint process that goes no where and they give me all empty promises.Honestly, the most frustrating experience I've had in my life for the least amount of money.",0
"I've moved from a different broadband over to Vodafone and ever since, I've been having a lot of problems which were either, not being able to connect to the Internet or a very slow Internet speed. On top of all this, it will randomly decide to drop out and disconnect from the device I'm using. Would recommend not choosing Vodafone.",0
"Offered free Amazon prime through rewards for 3 months but then charged me full price straight away,  so I cancelled my unused membership well within 14 days but have not been refunded, I will cancel with Vodafone as soon as I'm out of contract for this.Edit: I was charged full price  straight away  instead of the the supposed £1, the link I used was straight from  the vodafone rewards app if I didn't qualify for some reason  this should have been made crystal clear during the signing up process,  vodafone has got so expensive now it's the only reason I have stuck with them ,for the benefits,  it has put me off.",0
"Recently I switched to Vodafone for my broadband & home phone service from TalkTalk. Both of these use the Openreach network. For some reason, I'm still being billed by TalkTalk for ongoing service. I tried contacting TalkTalk, but trying to get any kind of resolution from them is borderline impossible.As for Vodafone, when you try to contact them, they don't even give you an option beyond a bot which, if it fails to find a solution for you (and it will fail, obviously - it just links to support articles) will pass you over to a human.Anyway, the conclusion I got after having to rephrase myself, because my request was seemingly misunderstood, is that, if I had selected the ""working line takeover"" option when I made the order, the previous ISP would have been notified.I'm not sure that there even was such an option. I didn't ever have to select such an option in the past when I was switching between Openreach providers - it's just assumed that the line is being taken over because, outside of some kind of fringe situation I can't imagine, why wouldn't it be taken over?I feel like I'm going crazy here because TalkTalk has their hand in my pocket, I can't get an answer from Vodafone on whether TT was notified which suggests that they don't even keep a record of it, and I don't want TT to take three months of billing from me for something they are literally not providing me but I seemingly can't get Vodafone to take responsibility for this so what can I do at this point?",0
Day 7 of problems with mobile phone signal in the Kendal area. It's almost impossible to make/receive calls or texts. Had the exact same problem a few months ago for 5 days.,0
"Vodafone obviously have quite a budget when it comes to fake reviews. The AI bots have generated pretty much every positive review. I would ask for my money back, they are all way too formulaic and everyone can see what you are doing. It's embarrassing. Here's a thought. Why not put all that time and energy into ACTUAL rather than fake customer service.",0
"Was told my partner's phone would be put back on after cut off around two weeks before end date never came back on, the customer service is terrible tbh and I myself left Vodafone ten years ago and havent gone back.Currently on the phone now it seems the staff are not trained correctly or do things on purpose. Having to wait 10 days for them to listen to phone calls where I know for a fact a PAC code should have been provided on the contract end date of today and now the account has been completely shut down and disconnected and there is no PAC code on the account! Simple process cannot be finalised and this was advised by the agent on the last call.Awful company would not advise anybody to go to Vodafone for anything.",0
"I made an order online to get new broadband. Vodafone cancelled it due to 'technical reasons' so they called me a couple days later, spent an hour and half on the phone with me processing the order again. Annoying as I lost my engineer appointment so everything was pushed back. I asked what the technical issue was and the guy gaslight me and said it was because I hadn't signed something. Whilst on the phone to him I checked all my documents they had sent and there was nothing about contract signing.Then a couple days later the called again to say it had been cancelled again. I pushed on this as it was a nonsense and the best I could get was something about a phone number which in both orders I said just to give me a new one. They said it was a Vodafone issue but couldn't give me a genuine reason. Also told me to try again in a month! For what just to cancel again and get delayed further. I can't wrap my head around technical issue = cancel order, it and absolutely idiotic way to run a business. Technical issue should just mean we have some time to sort the problem, you don't just cancel.Shambles of a company, gone to plusnet now but around 2 weeks lost of new service due to delays in engineer appointments.",0
"Awful service. I've been with them since March time and found it to be by far the worst broadband I've ever had, despite it being advertised as the quickest.I've had outages, devices unable to connect to a wi-fi router less than two metres away and unhelpful staff who have tried to blame me for not running LAN cables throughout my house, or who have ignored requests to not phone and deal with issues over email instead.Avoid if you want reliable internet.",0
"Shocking service. Robbed my money on a 24 month contract which couldn’t connect in my home, area or workplace. Went in my local store shortly after recovering phone and experiencing signal issues. The staff adjusting my settings and swapped sim and promised that issue was resolved. It wasn’t resolved and I have tried to contact Vodafone several times, the customer service is absolutely shocking! Very rude, disgusting service from customer service agents. I have made a complaint and still didn’t get a resolution. Was offered a refund that covers one months worth of paying, rather that 24 months that they have virtually robbed me. Was told it would be passed on to the ‘team’ over 2 months now and heard nothing since… I just want to be compensated for wasting my money on a phone contract that does absolutely nothing that I paid for after I was promised it was resolved! Next step to contact Ofcom for an actual result since Vodafone have the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Would never use or recommend to anyone.(Vodafone UK)",0
Really didn't want to have to leave a negative review but I am really losing patience.First there was issues getting our fibre live - issues passed between vodafone and openreach blaming each other. Absolutely no apologies or compensation from Voda from the time we were not connected to the service and still charged us full bill.Now Vodafone have not provided the voucher promised as part of taking the contract with them. Absolutely no help from the live chat team and the information given by them was of extremely poor quality and did not make any sense (assume a translator is being used for overseas staff?)Avoid Vodafone Broadband at all costs unless things drastically change.,0
"Terrible broadband and even worse customer service. I have been receiving a maximum download speed of 7mbs constantly and sometimes even lower even though my minimum guaranteed speed should be 32mbs. I have wasted countless hours on the chat to support who just seem to repeat themselves and I even agreed to upgrade to the full fibre and was told it would be activated the next day as they didn't need to do anything to then contact them 2 days later as the speed was even worse, to then be told that the order had been cancelled!? Then the next agent I spoke to wasn't even able to re confirm the order and said Id need to ring up again to a different person. I have asked multiple times to early terminate and that I wont be paying the fee as they aren't providing on their side of the contract and I just get the same repeated response saying they will fix it.",0

"The Vodafone network is by far the worst mobile network in the UK. The network has been unavailable in my area for over 3 months (Vodafone are aware), with no indication as to when it will be fixed. My wife, two kids and I are all moving to a different company that actually cares about its customers.",0
"I purchased an Unlimited Sim card with Vodafone to be used with my mobile on Hot Spot for £33 PM. (which went up straight away to £36 PM) It worked for the first 2 months, I then moved address to Iver to an area that Vodafone assured me would have good reception.Here I get no signal, and fellow residents around this area say that Vodafone doesn't work in this part of town. I then contacted Vodafone who just say on there records there is good signal here, and would not help. I said that I would only make further monthly payments when they provide a service. They smugly said just carry on paying the bill or I would have debt collectors visit, so they want me to pay for a service that I am not receiving for the contractual period of 3 years at a thousand pounds for no service. I am a pensioner and can't afford to throw away money like this.I put up with this for a further 3 months and stopped paying, and now they are pursuing with collections agents.I have informed Vodafone that I will pay the arrears and the monthly payments only when they provide the service that our contract is for.",0
Expressed disappointment that I have a problem getting any straight answer re new broadband but not actually prepared to do anything about it !,0
"My phone line installation through BT was cancelled without Vodafone telling me. Stayed in for the appointment, nothing. Called Vodafone to see why, there had been an issue with the switch; again they made no attempt to contact me to resolve the issue or to cancel the appointment. I complained and had to start the entire process again. Because I had originally done this through a 3rd party reward (£125 gift card) I lost the incentive due to it being 3rd party and not available anymore. I complained as I had to wait another 4-6 weeks for the installation process. This was brought forward thankfully and I was advised they would provide compensation for the troubles; never happened.After a few months calls began to appear on our bill. We have no landlines phone, never plugged one in and never made a single call. Yet all they would say is they're ""legitimate"" calls. The first manager who dealt with this (in June) was excellent. Sorted out the charges and at my request but a call bar on the line to stop further charges appearing. Every month since we have been charged with calls, no one is taking my complaint seriously. They just like to point out all the ""charges"" of hundreds that are against our landlines. I've been in touch with the fraud team, line has not been hacked, so nothing else is worth investigating. I am always refused when I ask to speak to someone other then the basic call agent. It always has to be a callback upto 24 hours later. I'm refused when I ask to speak to complaints, I ask the issue to be escalated and still nothing. Today I even had an agent tell me that you can not bar landlines to stop calls being made and refused to let me speak about the complaint to anyone else.The agent even told me there was nothing I could do, no external governing bodies even denying a ombudsman could be used. He denied everything until I mentioned CISAS and then still refused me the chance to speak to anyone else and I'd have to wait 24 hours.6 months of the same issue and I'm treated like this? Congratulations Vodafone for not helping me at all**Update**Interesting how they have been in touch so much since I put my complaint into the sphere. After speaking to different people, none of which told me they had cancelled my contract, they have resolved the charges but then the complaints team told me it was cancelled and that they could not restore it, even though their mistakes caused the whole problem. If I wanted it back I would have to go through the whole process from the beginning to start a new contract. Utterly ridiculous, why would I be willing to start a new contract after all this? Gone to Plus net, cheaper, quicker and no phone line which take this whole issue out of the equation.",0
"I have been compelled to leave Vodafone due to their inability to assist me effectively.I visited a Vodafone store to discuss an upgrade, which I was due for, and was provided with pricing options. During this discussion, I mentioned that other companies were offering better deals and that I needed time to consider my options.I then called Vodafone to explore a better offer, but I was informed that they couldn't access my account for upgrades due to a technical issue. The agent said they would escalate my case to the SOS team.Two weeks later, I still hadn't received any updates, so I called again. The issue was still unresolved, and the agent suggested I either return to the store or use the My Vodafone app to explore upgrade options.I requested to speak to a manager, but they only repeated what the previous agent had told me. Frustrated, I asked for a PAC code, which they provided. I also requested to be transferred to the complaints department. I was put on hold, and when the agent returned, he asked me to explain my complaint. I informed him that I would discuss it directly with the complaints team.The agent put me on hold again to consult with his manager, who claimed she would reach out to the complaints team and then placed me on hold once more. After what felt like an eternity, I was finally transferred to a complaints agent, who reiterated the same issues—my account had a problem, and the SOS team had advised me to visit the store or use the app. However, the deals on the app were more expensive than those quoted in the store.At this point, it became clear that Vodafone doesn't prioritize customer retention or resolving issues. So, as a loyal customer, I’m saying goodbye to Vodafone.4o mini",0
I joined Vodafone for “unlimited broadband” in September and the service was dreadful from day 1. Almost every day there were periods where there was no connection for about 20 minutes at a time. Customer services in India went through their list of checks several times but it made no difference. I left after 4 very stressful weeks.,0
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a company. Purchased a new broadband service from them. They canceled the installation without telling us, I took a day away from working. Had several phone calls with them one lasting 57mins! They kept telling me that it was canceled because they couldn't transfer our number across. This we hadn't asked them to do and they even sent us a new number in the confirmation letter. I was offered £6.10 compensation for my wasted day off!",0
On September 23rd i placed an order for Vodafone broadband the highest package to be installed fibre pro 2 the first time fhe engineer from cityfibee came i was watching on the house cameras he walked into the garden and then retreated and ran off nevsr to be seen and i receieved an email to say that i missed ths engineers visit i was furious! I rang and rebooked and the engineers visit the second time he came they said they didnt have the right tools and equipment to install the broadband cable after this the engineer needed a form signed by the neighbours to say they dont mind any work being done fo the trees so then i wasted time and did that then since then its november now going into december nearly 3 months and these engineers have still not come to install the wifi they kept saying we're coming today and then they would never shoe up and everytime id ring vodafone their service was rubbish they kept using excuses that the cityfibre portal was down and that theyre sorry this has happened etc we got to november 19th i said forget it cancel this rubbish then the vodafone customer services tried to be clever and lie and say oh my order is in the point of no return! WTF! 1) no thats a lie because you havent even installed anything yet 2) the engineer never shows up 3) i have a cooling off period so dont try and bait me into feeling bad and saying i cant cancel then they advisor said oh it takes 3 days for the order to cancel so then i got a text couple of hours later saying its been cancelled now. I even said i wanted to log a complaint they kept saying no no the best we can do is get a managers callback so i had enough it was rubbish service and they took the absolute mick to just trim a few tree branches and install fibre broadband cable,0
"Totally hopeless, wanted to get a replacement SIM for my 83 year old father who recently had to get a new handset with which his SIM didn’t work. Vodafone simply could not understand that someone who is 83 is not in a position to comply with all their unreasonable requirements. After numerous calls and over a week I had to get a new SIM and move network. Father completely worn out by the whole discriminatory  ageist episode. At 83 he cannot be without a phone for obvious reasons but that didn’t stop Vodafone messing me about for over a week. Their answer / response was a £30 voucher for an account my Father no longer has. You can’t write this stuff. PatheticAnd what a surprise instead of just arranging a call they have responded with all manner of convoluted solutions to “find out more”",0
"I tried talking to vodafone, explaining to them that I need to be free from the contract because I changed my tenancy and since they cannot give me a good signal, I have to transfer to another network. I explained to them, I would not be transferring if they are able to give me a good signal. However they can only give my 1 bar signal and E for my internet. It is not in my control to have this signal, and if they cannot provide it, it is only fair that they let me go. They want me to pay a termination fee which I am not happy to accept since I am not the one who has control with the signal. They should take action. They change my sim to e sim but signal is the same. After repeated calls, I am still with vodafone. I am sufferring, depress and very frustrated. I work hard to earn my money, and I want to get the worth of my money, the service that they promise to provide. But, instead, a big company like vodafone will not process my request to end with them freely and continue to make me suffer. I am now isolated from contacting my family which is my only source of strength. I am been very sad and depress and might be thinking that maybe all bad things would happen to me eventually. I don’t understand why vodafone is so greedy and won’t let me go. This happened since 1st November and they have not taken action. They don’t care. They just want your money! I hope you are happy to waste my money. I hope you are happy to contribute further to my depression. I just hope whoever owns this company, this comes back to you a hundred fold. I hope you get so rich than you are now and still be unhappy!",0
"I’ve been a Vodafone customer for 8 years, but I’m leaving because their network has become completely unreliable. For months, I’ve dealt with constant network issues—poor signal, slow internet speeds, and frequent outages. Despite contacting customer service multiple times, nothing has been resolved. I rely on a stable connection for work and everyday use, and Vodafone has let me down.To make matters worse, they’re now trying to charge me £206 to leave, even though the reason I’m leaving is entirely due to their inability to provide the service I’m paying for. After nearly a decade of loyalty, I expected better treatment. Vodafone should take responsibility for their own network issues instead of punishing long-term customers for leaving. I’m not sure what to? Very disappointing.",0
Edit to Vodafone response below . I have tried phoning customer services for hours . No one had a clue to resolve the issue. Wasted hours .(Main message)I had to leave this company after poor customer service .Their customer service via the app chat atrocious . Wouldn’t help me with a simple contract merge . They wanted me to pay for two accounts simultaneously. Even though it’s one account as I upgraded. Then I have to pay 30days extra even though I am out of contract and gave notice to cancel,0
"RIP OFF BRODBAND‼️‼️‼️Do not trust is absolute rip off, scammers ‼️I bought a Vodafone mobile broadband in August 24 , data was disappeared in two hours, next month I turned off WiFi from my mobile to not use any broadband data also disappeared all data. So next month I removed SIM card from the broadband device for six weeks and phoned Vodafone to ask how much data I still have answer was non because you used it all.On to a question how was possible when SIM card was on the table for past six weeks answer was you can cancel your contract which will cost you £148 or add data which will cost you extra £25 a month.So please don’t trust you will loose money, you won’t have internet and on a top of everything you will have a lots of stress!",0
"I signed up for their broadband after just moving to the UK. My service didn't go live on the day they said it would, every time I called customer service they were not really interested in solving the problem but just buying themselves time so you exceed the 14 day free cancellation period and pay a fee. Even after them assuring me I would not pay for anything except the equipment, I got an email saying I now owe 164 pounds....Mind you I have never even used their wifi and any engineer can confirm this when they performed the checks.Every time customer service called me, it was to see my setup, which hadn't changed from the previous calls, the told me they would send ethernet cables on two occasions, both never came.No company has ever wasted my time as much as Vodafone, and to make it worse I had just started a graduate job where I had to study and work from home extensively the first two months, imagine this experience with no wifi. When I asked them to send an engineer to come check in person, they ignored my request. Visited the branch in person who said they could not help with broadband and that I should continue calling customer service. An absolutely horrific experience with them.",0
"So this is a bit of a long story that goes back to Dec 2023 when I entered the Swindon branch and took out a new airtime deal that was on a promotional offer for £33 a month reduced by 50% to £16.50 for the first 6 months. The sale advisor at the time confirmed that after the initial 6 months I will be able to cancel or switch to a cheaper deal. So once the 6 months almost elapsed and I received a notification that the 50% discount was ending I went back to the same store to cancel the deal only to be presented with a very rude and uninterested staff member telling me that cancellation is not possible, this was in spite of me explaining (sadly nothing on paper or recorded) the conversation with his colleague 6 months ago. At this point feeling so cheated I left the store and put this behind as a bad experience wishing I had kept record of the promise made to me in an email.Forwarding to the 30th Oct 2024, I went to the Bath branch to enquire about ways to reduce my £33 p/m phone bill and was told by Colin the manager that I could get a trade-in deal for my old phone which was inspected by him in exchange for a new Iphone 16 plan. I proceeded to signing the new contract and a few days later I posted my old phone using the provided packaging by Vodafone. Forwarding a few more days I received an SMS informing me that the old phone will be returned as it was damaged and therefore not suitable for a trade-in. This is the same phone that was insepected by the Manager at the branch when I took out the new contract. As the trade-in price was going to be added to my bill I proceeded to exercise my right to cancel the contract within the 14 days cooling period as suggested by the person on the web chat customer service and to also go back to the Bath store and explain the issue.This is what I did and ended up speaking to another Manager (as Colin with whom I took out the new contract was not there) who logged a formal complaint in the system and told me that someone from Vodafone would call me within 48 hours. As I was expecting this phone call never arrived. So going by all my negative experience with Vodafone, my question is do you incentivise your sales staff to sell contracts at any cost even if it means you make promises without delivering on them and deceive your customers? I shall never give your company anymore business, whether phone or internet.",0
"Needed an ISP as part of moving house and decided to give Vodafone a go. Ordering process was straightforward (although a bit convoluted) but the order went through and got the confirmation mails. Decided to check a few days later as to what my order status was and when I could expect to be connected again so used their chatbot. It couldn't help with order status so I asked to be transferred from bot to agent (who took all my information) to be transferred again to yet another agent (taking all the same information again) to then be told the order was cancelled for an ""Unknown"" reason. I guess I'll go with a provider who understands communication and customer support given Vodafone clearly doesn't want me.",0
"Absolute waste of time, cancelled my order without even telling me, when i contacted them to enquire why they fed me a list of possible reasons, this was all after i twice filled the form for the social tariff heard nothing back at all so decided to just go for a normal package, could at least have the decency to inform me that the order had been cancelled without my having to check myself",0
"I tried to cancel my business broadband with Vodafone as I switched to another provider providing better service in my area. I contacted Vodafone at least 10 times from February 2024 to November 2024 to do this very basic job . However, I keep going around in circles as their representatives keep raising new requests with their back - office team for an immediate disconnection . They write some notes and say there is a reference number showing up for the previous requests but for some reason , they have to create a new request. I am fed up listening to the same excuses and they literally have no shame to keep me informed and up to date . I am still being charged for the service I have no longer been using.One of their representatives asked me to cancel the direct debit, which I did either in June or July 2024 . However, I keep receiving emails to pay the bills as my account is still active , which I can also see when I log in to my account - the overdue amount.I never had such a terrible customer service experience in my whole life and will never recommend Vodafone to anyone. Their customer service is outsourced , and most of their representatives can't even speak proper English and don't understand what I am trying to say . Once I am done with the call with customer service , I never receive any message to give my feedback.Does anyone know how I can file my complaint with a third party that can take some action ?",0
"Here we go again... I write a bad review, Vodafone send Openreach round and did work I didn't really need but said someone would come back to do the work I did need doing.... still waiting.",0
Despite many many tries by Vodafone I'm still not getting the speed I'm paying for. One day I'm getting over 100 but mostly it's 50. The latest communication they said they tested it from their end and I'm getting the speed paid for over 100. I've tried all types of tests including Vodaphones own test and it disagrees with them. Something is not right and despite many tries by Vodafone they do not seem to know what the problem is.,0

Trying to upgrade my current Vodafone broadband to Vodafone full fibre I accepted a good deal from them & received confirmation emails from them & Open Reach regarding new external cabling & the change in speed.Unfortunately OReach failed to turn up as agreed so I turned to Vodafone for help . I started with the compulsory online chat bot but eventually got a human responding. After a wasted 70mins I was told that despite the email confirmations from Voda & Open Reach the Vodafone agent online could find no record of my new contract & I was told to apply all over again for a new contract. My wife feels that that we should not stay with a company that behaves like this but I still naively hope that Voda will sort out this mess !PSJust had new response from Open Reach directing me to ask Vodafone to contact them on my behalf.Fat chance !,0
"This network is a joke. Traveled to Czech republic where data within the UK pack should be working. Vodafone sent me a message saying I have to purchase add-on for £9 to get 3gb of data. What a joke. Another issue, I topped up £10 to make an international call but it didn't work. Vodafone customer support told me I had to buy add-on for £7 to make that call (Montenegro - EU country). Excuse me? In addition, international SMS doesn't work. This is such a disgustingly greedy company I would never return to.",0

"Giving one star is an understandment.

"went in to buy a wifi hotspot dongle. The lady set it up and made us sit there for half an hour saying something wasn’t right. after another half an hour of her doing nothing and staring at the screen without even clicking once, the shop was closing and we had to leave. what a wasted hour of my life. went into Three the next day and left with a hotspot dongle within 10 minutes. Vodafone service is just shocking, no manager in sight and clearly no idea what she was doing, as we sat in awkward silence for an entire hour. she even got the dongle out , scanned it, and then said it didn’t work. What a load of horse shit",0
"I have called on the 15/11/2024 (Friday), which my line was disconnected and mentioned by the non-business members, as the business customer service department is closed, and we cannot help, and I should call on Monday.As you could imagine the importance of Business Line, and broadband to a hospitality business, this interrupted my business for busiest days of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.( Monday )After a discussion on the phone, they were not able to guarantee the Line Number, if disconnected it would take 14 days to put my existing service back online, considering, my till machine, card machine, Ordering Systems.My line has been disconnecting for unknown reasons which they cannot clarify and said it is a ‘system error’ my line should be protected, and I should not be made vulnerable of this matter.This is the second time I am experiencing terrible customer service, first with Installing / Openreach and now disconnection.I will not recommend at all to my worst enemy.",0
The most idiotic customer service I've ever experienced.They simply don't understand anything that I request and constantly stall for time.A simple request takes over 30 minutes with Vodaphone customer service because none of the staff understand the issue and repeatedly ask the same questions.,0
"Terrible company,I will never buy anything from them againI had business broadband and all bad experience!!!!!",0
18/11 Have you read my content? I chatted with your CS twice and the issue wasn't solved besides a new order without dealt offers. Who’s responsible for the invalid order numbers? Those are generated from your company.I ordered 2 times from the compare broadband quote on Topcashback website. The later one made on 6th Nov with confirmation email. I traced the orders afterwards but CS claimed the orders didn't exist with inactive accounts. He also claimed he couldn't reactivate and just create new order without offers. My wife experienced once 2 years ago that created her current contract without cashback and vouchers offered as I hurried for the service. I think this company is really tricky and unreliable with the contracts. And I do hope Topcashback should stop the deals with it as it becomes notorious I believe.,0
My only regret is changing from BT to Vodafone. I never had netflix frozen with BT or bad whatsapp calls etc,0
"I’ve been without cell coverage for three days, and it’s caused disruption. On Friday, I tried to SMS a charity donation (Children in Need), conduct online banking, and work on a website for my business, all of which relied on SMS for verification. I couldn’t do any of it.When I tried to log into my Vodafone account for help, the platform needed to send me an SMS for verification—ironic, given the situation. I called the support line, and after some back and forth, the customer service agent initially suspected a failed SIM. I had to suggest checking network coverage, which they did, only to confirm that this was the issue.I politely shared my frustration and asked if any compensation would be considered for the undelivered service I paid for and didn’t receive. The agent suggested I call back again later as they didn’t have any mechanism to call me.It’s disappointing that Vodafone, as a leading provider, lacks minimum viable support or compensation processes for situations like this. Losing service for days is frustrating enough without needing to chase them for updates or resolutions.",0

They continually failed to get my broadband set up and my emails stopped being responded to and i was sent in circles for hours on live chat. As a deaf and disabled individual without a mobile phone i am prevented from a simple task like logging into my account as a mobile phone code is required and because i didn’t have that i wasted over an hour on live chat and forced to use someone else’s phone who does not live with me so cannot log in unless they happen to be around.my  bill was also wrong and i was double charged.They don’t reply to my formal complaint and feel like i am being discriminated against for my disabilities.I told them i was deaf and disabled from the outset and had they told me there was no way for people like me to get help and no way to log in without a mobile phone code then i would never have signed up as it’s wholly unsuitable for me.No redress has been offered either and i don’t know how to cancel down and get my money back.complaint ref 120384148,0

I can't go to another provider as Vodafone say they can't give me a PAC code at this point. I wish I'd never, ever gone near them. I will not be switching my mobile to them .

Grudgingly (and as if they were bestowing a favour) the account was cleared. I'm told the credit score will also be corrected. But refused to consider some kind of compensation in view of the stress, hassle and trouble I've been caused. DON'T TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGE POLE!Their reply is nonsense. They are extremely unwilling to help in any way despite their message to the contrary. I doubt if whoever wrote it knows anything at all about the situation.",0
"I cancelled my contract back in June via the online chat facility, which was a very lengthy process. My last and final payment was due for July. However Vodaphone continued to take payment in August and September. In October after realising this I cancelled my DD.Now all I get is threatening emails about an overdue account from an ""no-reply"" email.I have telephoned, explained the situation, also via the online chat, all Vodaphone want to do is keep you engaged with them for a very lengthy time and pass you from department to department.

"Possibly the worst customer service experience I have ever had! I have had mobile broadband with Vodafone for 3 years, which has been great up until I tried to upgrade my contract a couple of days ago. In an incredible turn of events, I now have a cancelled contract and no upgrade, unbelievable! I couldn't even try harder to give Vodafone my money. After wasting approximately 4 hours on the phone being passed from enept person to enept person, being put on hold after hold. And all I wanted was to renew my contract and confirm my upgrade. This isn't the first time this has happened to me over the years with Vodafone.Customer service is everything and is very much worth going with a company that can actually look after you. I will be shopping else where for my mobile Internet, I would highly recommend you do the same",0
"Very poor customer care, I contacted Vodafone to explain I had recently had to stop work to look after my autistic daughter who had been taken out of school due to anxiety and asked if I could spread my payments, but this landed of deaf ears and I was only given a deadline for payment, a few weeks later vodafone disconnected my phone and also my daughters phone. Im a single parent and live in a remote area so this caused a huge problem as I didn't have a landline, I couldnt ring Doctors or Friends in an already stressful situation but Vodafone only cared about payment. A few months later my Mother died suddenly and this was devastating for all of our family, for the first time in 30 years I found my self using a public payphone to organize my mothers funeral and when I contacted Vodafone and explained they once again demanded payment before they would reconnect. Ive been with Vodafone for 26 years and would never recommend this company to anybody, absolutely no empathy or care what so ever for their customers. Steer well clear of this company and use one of their competitors.This network provider doesn't even deserve the 1 x star ive given, sadly there isn't a zero star option.",0
"This is the second part of a review. Without going into long and boring detail, there was an issue with my daughter’s eSIM in Liverpool, with me (the account holder) in Brentwood Essex.  On the first visit Liverpool staff sympathetic but unable to help. On the second visit, involving the very helpful Vodafone staff in Brentwood, the guy in the Liverpool store was appallingly rude to both my daughter and the Brentwood store staff, (witnessed by all of us because it was on a FaceTime call) leaving her in tears and us thinking that the only explanation for his conduct was that he was working his notice.  When eventually the Brentwood staff asked how they could find a solution for this Vodafone customer, his response was to walk away, saying it wasn’t his problem. The zero score in the title is harsh, because the first Liverpool employee was at least polite and sympathetic, but the second fully deserves zero stars.PS.  Are you seriously suggesting (through the links below) that the way to address this is through social media sites? Is that how you do customer service?",0

"Abysmal customer service! For 5 days we've been told to wait 24 hours for our 500mpbs speed Internet to work but it's reaching no higher than 75.1mpbs! Had an open reach tech come out to be told they've sold us the 80mpbs package and not upgraded it, and they should know and see this clearly when we call and complain. Still awaiting a resolution and just want to leave the company at this point and go for sky!!",0
"Have been with you for over 20 years,  pay a contract for me, my wife and daughter,  in recent weeks my daughter and I have stopped receiving the feel good Friday notifications,  yet my wife continues to do so,  not sure what criteria you are using and why my daughter and I are being discriminated against but suffice to say all 3 of us will be moving to another provider whenever is convenient to us",0
"Helping a disabled friend on PIP sign up to the social tariff. Tried 3 times, got contact from a person at Vodafone on one occasion but then that vapourised. The social tariff doesn't exist because you can't access it. I would describe Vodafone as worse than useless and a waste of time.edit: That Facebook address is giving me the Unofficial Vodafone Complaints Page. Vodafone sends me to an unofficial complaints page? No thanks, that page looks like a joke. I'll leave my complaint as it is.",0
"Awkward company. They've messed up my number when I upgraded to a contract sim. Now I have 2 numbers and I've rang up twice about it and it's still showing 2 different numbers randomly... sort your system out.Costing me money. Customers don't know it's me , family don't know it's me... loosing money and costing me time and all sorts of problems. Absolute joke. Will probably have to cancel the contract and take the number to another network.Shocking treatment. Not to mention the fact I paid extra monthly to be able to have more international data. Because I live on a boarder in Ireland. I'm limited to like 25gb a month because where I live I'm always roaming even though I'm still in the UK.Just feel robbed.",0
"Dreadful customer service. I am moving house and do not have a date confirmed, so I contacted Vodafone and explained that I only know a rough time which is a few weeks, the agent said this is fine as I can book a slot for 2 weeks, and then simply call to delay it for as long as I'd like until I get a date confirmed so that I do not go without internet, sounded good, so firstly they set it up for the wrong address, so I spent another hour on chat changing that, then I was told an engineer is needed, then they told me no engineer needed, they finally got the right address and it was booked to go live on the 19th, still no move in date so I go to chat to delay it, another hour on chat constantly repeating my full name and account number over and over, only to be told that as its a migration, the date cannot be amended, so I was lied to from the start just to keep me as a customer. Very dishonest company and agents who have zero clue what they are talking about.",0
"I was with vodafone for 7 years.  I never missed a payment, all taken by direct debit.  The last and final payment was also taken by direct debit.  Now they have waited 2 years to say the final payment was just over £1 short and they have sent it to a debt collection agency and have totally ruined my perfect credit rating.  They say they emailed and text me but I received nothing.  No use trying to tell them anything they just say 'the computer says'.  Was thinking of going back to them as the reception is better in our area but I am unable to trust them anymore.",0
"Please don't have anything to do with this company, they miss sell you contracts to earn  thier comission, they constantly tell you on the phone your complaint is sorted, only to find nothing has changed. And don't in any circumstance give them your bank details. You have been warned. On going problem since end of July .",0
I was on phone trying to see if I could transfer a contract over to somebody else. My main purpose of calling was to ask for advice on the situation and step by step instructions on how to do it and the phone was put down on me twice by the same woman. I’ve been with Vodaphone for a few years and I’ve never expected to be treated like this at a very crucial time. Do better!!!!!,0
They send fake gift card and I have reported it to the police,0
II have rarely endured such inefficiency from a company. They have sent not one but two iPhones to me in error. Vodaphone have stolen £31.99from my account-no permission was given by me. I have had approximately 15 phone calls from vodaphone in the past 2 days. They have now told me my card has been cancelled AND THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN MY BANK ACCOUNT BEFORE MY MONEY IS REFUNDED,0
"My name is John Walker, and I’m writing on behalf of my 72 year old father.Long story short! After learning that my dad was overpaying for his mobile service provided by Vodafone, I searched for a better (cheaper) deal. I picked up a Lebara SIM card for him and asked him to get a PAC code from Vodafone. When speaking to the Vodafone rep via web chat, he really didn’t seem interested in retaining my dads business and when he was asked for the PAC code he asked which network my dad would be switching to. When he was told Lebara, the rep told my dad that Lebara use the Vodafone network and that he could not transfer his Vodafone number to his new Lebara sim, the rep said this a few times. I told my dad that I thought this is nonsense and to insist on getting the PAC code and then switch the number using the Lebara website, the rep gave my dad the PAC code. My dad then put the details of the Lebara phone number, his Vodafone phone number, the PAC code and the date that he wanted the number transfer to occur into Lebaras website, and we said let’s see what happens. The number transfer happened as requested, there was no problem at all!Why did Vodafone blatantly lie to my dad and tell him that he couldn’t keep his number? I consider this entrapment and fraudulent behaviour! It’s also cheating a pensioner out of his pension and it’s a bear faced lie! All to try to trick my dad into staying with Vodafone and charging him more for an inferior mobile package. Utterly disgraceful and disgusting behaviour from Vodafone!",0
"ONE OF THE MOST RUBBISH SERVICE I EVER GET, AS THEY CANT PROVIDE SERVICE ON MY NEW ADDRESS THEY TOLD ME TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT AND SAID WE NOT CHARGING YOU FOR TERMINATION CHARGES, HOW SOMEONE CAN BELIEVE THAT THEY WAVING OFF TERMINATION CHARGES. NOW I CANT SEE IN MY ACCOUNT FOR ANY UPDATION AS THEY ALREADY DISCONNECT MY ACCOUNT AND WHEN I CALL THEM BACK TO GET ANY UPDATE THEY SAID THEY CANT UPDATE ME AS MY FINAL BILL ISNT GENERATED. I ASKED TO RAISE A COMPLAINT WHICH WAS DENIED OVER THE PHONE REASONING THEY CANT DO IT AND TOLD YOU WILL GET A CALL TO REGISTER WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED.",0
"I have been a Vodafone mobile and broadband customer for a couple of years and it has worked out ok. Vodafone has a separate app for broadband which enables customers to manage their home broadband from their mobile device and then an app for the other services (mobile, mobile broadband) for account management. When I renewed my mobile phone subscription with them, they amalgamated my billing. What seems to have happened is that they then disassociated the broadband from the main account (although they still bill me for it). When I tried to find answers online, their chatbot wasn't working and the answers in the community forum with any useful information had all been deleted by Vodafone. These are literally the only way that you can get in contact with Vodafone through the Vodafone website or app. I ended up trawling through social media to try to find an account of theirs and found one on Twitter (X) - on that, there is a message for Vodafone UK saying that you can direct message them for help . They have literally disabled their website and are relying on a third party social media platform to run their help desk, for those customers who haven't lost the will to live by the time they reach it. The help function they run via X is on a turn based system, so someone responds to you and then you don't hear anything for minutes at a time as they help other people. It's the most inefficient and ineffectual help system I've ever come across, and I used to be a BT customer so I've experienced some pretty terrible helpdesks. It's unbelievable.",0

I chose vodafone as they were £5 cheaper than BT. I just canceled during my cooling off period. Ill happily pay £5 extra to BT for good customer service and peace of mind.1.the dpd driver made not attempt to deliver the router to me even to go as far as to take a pic of a random address.2. I could not access my online account therfore I had no access to my bills.All this with in 2 days. They can get out of town!The low price is not worth it save yourself the time as hassle.,0
"I had broadband put into my new home 3 months ago but has very weak broadband strength, if I go any further than 15 feet away from the router it cuts out .Our ring doorbell is no more than ten feet away and it has trouble staying connected to the router , Iv rang them numerous times and they say it’s my fault as the router should be up above the tv so it transfers the signal better lol 😂Anyway I did this and it’s still the same .I asked if they could send me a new router and they have ignored me ever since",0
"Really bad , why1  I did a new broadband contract with them 3 months ago . Not only have I not received the package after 3 months and 5 hours of phone calls they have now disconnected my old router even though I'm still paying for it . Please give up foreign call centres as although they speak English they don't speak English well enough . Example ; how do you spell Peter and how do you spell Lancashire!I despair.",0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Cancelled my order TWICE without my knowledge or permission leaving me over three weeks into a new home with no broadband. I rely on broadband for work and they don’t seem to understand the seriousness of my situation. They have refused to see if they can activate me as per my second cancelled order date, instead offering me a sim to put into my O2 phone! I would never recommend Vodafone broadband to anyone.",0
"Absolute thieves.  Paid £150 deposit for a laptop but returned it.  After they received the laptop back they erased everything from my vodafone but instead  of refunding my money they have credited it to my account and will not refund until after my next bill.  I don't have a bill and when I asked when my money would be refunded back to my bank seeing as the laptop account no longer exists they wouldn't tell me and kept copying and pasting the same generic rubbish about not to worry and one of their dedicated customer service reps will sort it and completely evaded the question.   I unfortunately have a phone contract and my home broadband with them but as soon as these contracts end I will be going to another provider, the way they treat their customers is shocking.",0
"Had to put a star.we have never dealt with a company where customers service is so shocking as we have now been waiting since 30/09/24 for broadband connection. Since then our original order which was through U Switch was cancelled apparently due to missing calls from Vodafone ( which were not necessary as we were given an installation date ) and they had offered us £200 approx credit due to delays caused by Vodafone, also £95 voucher from U Switch when we made contact with Vodafone after taking the day off work awaiting installation, we were informed “ connection cancelled all offers were now void ie credits and we needed to try again “ frustrated we did this and were told by “ Amir” that connection date was now 19/11/24 we also explained to “ Amir” that we were away this week, BUT, came home to SIX missed calls on our landline and had received a text on mobile and would call us back within the hour?! No call on mobile ( again? We had an installation date so why all these calls??) We told the chap we just called…..would you believe his name was “ Amir” and said forget it we may as well stick with our current provider to omit any further stress.",0
"Vodafone continue to hide behind the 3rd party scammers Onecom Ltd, despite the contract being with the scammers, Vodafone sit quiet collecting the direct debits. Asking their useless, customer relation manager?? Emmar, who fail to provide information regarding your commencement date of the DD, not that he can be understood anyway. It is about time Emmar, was promoted to compiling the 10 fake reviews per hour on trustpilot, so they remain at a fake 5 star. If you took Vodafone’s fake reviews away, it would reveal the one star company they really are.",0
"I got a Vodafone PAYG SIM as a backup for my usual phone and I put £40 of credit on, only to find that £20 was taken without my permission and applied to the 'Big Value Bundle', the most expensive of the rather expensive bundles offered.I contacted customer services to gain no satisfactory response as to why this happened. I explained several times that I wished to make a formal complaint and I was ignored, after being in a webchat for almost an hour (it was eventually cut off). It was an appalling experience.",0
"Useless. Slow to react and don't actually care. Let my number be moved fraudulently to another network via a PAC request - despite me reporting the attempted fraud - and completely disinterested in fixing the issue. Customer service staff unable to do anything as ""my number wasn't on their system"". Clearly unable to keep data safe. Stay away.Update (after Vodafone's hollow, corporate C&P reply): I did manage to talk to the fraud team, after strongly insisting to the customer service team that they put me through. The fraud was reported on Monday, it is now Thursday & Vodafone still can't even tell me if my number has been blocked yet.It would appear that GiffGaff might be even worse, as it was to there that my number was fraudulently ported.",0
Not happy. I got a call of vodafone to set up a new contract has my old contract with them was coming to a end. So I did but on sim only and a free cheap handset . They said they would also pay the remaining balance of my old contract. They lied to me they don't pay off your remaining balance. Don't believe them if they tell you thisJanice mcdonnell,0
I was recently assisted by Bilaal in the Stratford-upon-Avon store whilst setting up a new business contract. Bilaal himself was very helpful and knowledgeable. I have been attempting to transfer my business contract with O2 to a new business contract with Vodafone. I first visited the Stratford-upon-Avon store in October 2024 and the team were unable to assist me on the day due to technical limitations and my limited company credit check being unable to be processed. I spent approximately three hours in store whilst the team called multiple departments trying to resolve the system issues but in the end they were unable to successfully set up a new business contract for me. I visited the store again in November 2024 and experienced the same issues with my bank details being greyed out on the internal Vodafone systems meaning my credit check could not complete. As at the time of this review I have still been unable to successfully set up a new business contract with Vodafone. The team were as helpful as they could be but due to the incredibly poor and outdated computer systems I am still unable to open a new contract for my business phone. This is taking a considerable amount of time and is no closer to being resolved. I would advise Vodafone upgrade their systems for business credit checks and completely re-evaluate how they service business customers in store. This is some of the worst provider service I have ever received and I would not recommend Vodafone to any other business owners looking to set up new contracts going forward.,0
The customer service is beyond horrific.  I have been waiting a month without broadband.  I raised a ticket weeks ago and the only way I can get an update is by continuously going through their TOBi AI chatbot (takes about 15 mins round the houses each time of irrelevant questions and answers before eventually being transferred to an adviser).,0
"Went to local Vodafone store to transfer 3 existing mobile numbers, got what seemed a good deal but told could only do 2 numbers now and the third in 30days.. just pop back and we will do it.. 7months on several visits to store cannot transfer 3rd number. Total joke have been mid sold product.. spoke to call centre no joy, asked to raise complaint as been mid sold product.. was offered £50.. declined the offer as what I require is 3 sims not to be bought off.. So going to persue complaint",0
"I have been a customer of this company since 2016. Initially, the service was very good, but it has now become one of the worst companies in the UK. The customer support is extremely poor, and the staff are rude and reluctant to answer questions. This is not the first time I’ve had a bad experience with customer support; they don’t provide proper responses. Additionally, I’m being charged extra for no reason. I’m truly disappointed with the terrible management—it’s honestly shameful.",0
"I went on the live chat, asked to speak to a person. I was informed it would take between 1 and 3 minutes. When they eventually came on the chat, they asked my name then cut me off whilst I was typing it! What is the point of providing a service that does not work? Vodafone have now replied by suggesting I raise the issue on social media! I do not have either an X account or an instagram account.  I use facebook to keep in touch with my friends, not so that I can report a problem.  I cannot wait to leave this company once my contract ends",0
"Went on chat to cancel my broadband since I am now redundant I need a cheaper contract, I was persauded by them to start a new lower priced one, but after they had confirmed the order. The representative went through the annual increase which amounted to effectively a16:67% increase in fees after only 5 months.. unimpressed so I said forget it.. after 3 1/4 hours I transferred again to a 4th person! And he told me it could be cancelled as it was “beyond he point of no return” WTF!!! Representative refused my request to escalate. Even when I pointed out the law requires a 14 day cooling off notice… and effectively just told me to ring in!! Then after I pointed out the law to him he…. Transferred me back to the original department!….. at that point I waited in another queue…The chat essay was now a good 10 min read.Who said they couldn’t do a cancellation and sent me on to a 6th person. Who finally worked out that the 1st person had done an immediate change which no one else was able to reverse… how appalling.4hrs 25 mins of my time I will not get back!",0
"The service is diabolical, ordered a phone, it took 2 weeks longer than promised, missed her birthday. I paid £800 upfront payment. Told by customer services she could collect it, they wouldn't do so, cancelled order, but then found out it wasn't cancelled, holding onto the money, apparently another 10 days now to get money back. Shocking as soon as we can all leave this network we are gone.",0

"I'll start with a positive to show this a balanced review. I had broadband with Vodafone for 2 years and the service was very reliable. No complaints there.The problem started as soon as I migrated to another provider using OTS (One Touch Switch). All seemed to be fine in that the new service started on the agreed date, Vodafone's service ceased on the same date. However, Vodafone has kept billing me. I have been on the phone to them umpteen times over the past month, each time for about an hour at a time. I am given the same explanation each time in that their system shows the service in some kind of stuck mode (do I really care about their internal systems?) and that the correction would be made within 2 to 3 working days. It never happens.After several rounds of this, I have asked to speak to someone more senior as I have grown tired of being given the same explanation and nothing getting resolved. Their managers seem very reluctant to speak to a customer as not one has ever come on the line. I think their front staff try to do their best but they seem powerless to either resolve the problem or to engage a manager.I am now so dissatisfied, I will most likely contact Ofcom/ombudsman.Update on 15/11/24 following Vodafone's reply:Like many people, I don't use X or Instagram. If the Vodafone team/person that posted the reply was sincere in wanting to look into this matter, they would have looked up the account number I included with the original review. I thought that was what it was for, no? More of Vodafone looking at things from their perspective rather than trying to see it from the customer's.",0
"I ordered Full Fibre broadband, which required both external and internal installations. The external work was completed in preparation for the installation inside my flat, initially scheduled for Friday, 8th November 2024.1) On Tuesday, 5th November 2024, at 15:36, I received a text from Vodafone informing me that both my order and the engineer appointment had been cancelled.2) Upon investigation, I learned that a neighbour had lodged a complaint about a City Fibre engineer allegedly using an unauthorised key to access the building. This matter had nothing to do with my order.3) City Fibre then informed Vodafone that the work was **on hold** and requested that Vodafone obtain clarification from me to ensure all parties were agreeable to proceed. My neighbour confirmed that his complaint was solely about the key-cutting incident and did not pertain to the work itself.4) Vodafone misunderstood or mismanaged this request and cancelled my order without contacting me for clarification.5) I contacted City Fibre, who confirmed they never requested the cancellation. They read their notes verbatim, with timestamps, and reiterated that they needed Vodafone's instruction to proceed.**From my perspective, the solution was straightforward. The City Fibre engineer had already completed the initial phase of the installation and only needed to complete the work in my flat. All that was needed was for Vodafone to contact City Fibre to confirm that no neighbour requested the work to stop. However, Vodafone chose not to take these steps, even though I had arranged time off work for the installation on 8th November 2024.**---Over two days, I spent countless hours calling Vodafone, navigating automated systems and speaking to service advisors who told me they could not reverse the cancellation or directly contact City Fibre. Vodafone repeatedly blamed City Fibre, while City Fibre stated they could only act on Vodafone's instructions. This lack of transparency and ownership left me in the middle, managing the coordination myself.**Additional Frustrations**- Service advisors directed me to place a new order on the website, which I did, only for it to be cancelled again at 11:26 on Wednesday, 6th November 2024.- Most service advisors refused to transfer me to the ""home broadband"" team until one agent eventually did. This agent promised to expedite the issue with City Fibre and follow up with a call between 17:30 and 18:30 the next evening but failed to do so.- I had to contact Vodafone again, and after extensive discussions, an advisor escalated the issue but could not connect me to a manager, resulting in another 24-hour wait for a callback.- A manager called on Thursday, 7th November 2024, only to inform me that their only option was to raise another formal complaint, adding another day to the process.- Shaiana from customer care called the following day, not to discuss my complaint but only to transfer me back to the ""home broadband"" team, where a third order was placed over the phone, which was subsequently cancelled on Tuesday, 12th November 2024.**Update**I have been contacted by Vodafone Customer Care, who advised that ""City Fibre requires up to 120 days to obtain permission"" to complete the work. However, the agent was unable to clarify what specific permission is needed. This statement directly contradicts City Fibre, who have already completed the initial phase of the installation and were scheduled to finish the work within my flat.Vodafone has also confirmed that they cannot provide interim broadband and no longer offer broadband services that are not Full Fibre. As I cannot wait 120 days without an internet service provider, Vodafone has effectively left me with no choice but to take my business elsewhere.",0
"I am experiencing the worst customer service Ive ever experienced. There is no possible way to speak with someone at vodafone it’s an impossible task. I have  submitted a transfer of ownership form on 23rd October, everything completed as requested as I am trying to switch to a business account and I have heard nothing except it was in process.I have tried contacting and when you call and try and speak to someone you get the automated everything choices but no option to speak with someone it then just ends the call on me. The chat bot says I haven't been able to transfer with various stupid responses ! How on earth do you run a business for customers with no way of actually speaking with anyone.Im going to have to now cancel my account and switch providers I cant  have a business account with someone who offers zero help or assistance in-the form of a real person.Having spoken to a chat person they advise the transfer was stopped as they called my daughter ( who knew nothing about transfer) and she said she didn't know about it? Its not her account nor the name on the account so why even speak to her. I spoke with them after this and confirmed it was confusion on her part and to still process however they have not processed for this reason. So what can I do? No help what so ever, just call this number but the number provided on the chat doesn't even exist. Absolutely useless!!! Tell me how I am supposed to resolve when you have no support in place for me, currently looking at EE I hear customer service is far better.",0
"Have spent 4 days trying to get a contract for my house. System keeps telling me my personal details are wrong. They are not wrong. No one at Vodafone is able to help as I was trying to sign up via moneysupermarket.com where I was going to get voucher for £100. If I get help from Vodaphone I loose the £100? Their system is not fit for purpose and it is going to cost me money. Wrote an e mail complaing, then filled in complaints form. Vodafone wrote and said they would contact me by phone. Four days later staff at Vodafone have not worked out how to ring me on my mobile phone. Not a Vodafone one, thank god, but on their network. I have been told nothing but lies that they had called me a number of times. To add insult to injury I am a shareholder! Have told them! Still treated badly. Ah well I am very disappointed. I have terminated my contract with my previous supplier. Unfortunately where we live there are few suppliers and even fewer offering a telephone connection. Mobile signal in house is very poor. I am on holiday at the moment so have use of internet. When I return home I have no way of getting this sorted. Thanks Vodaphone UK.",0
"Absolutely Terrible service, internet doesn’t work even though you pay an extortionate amount a month for their service. Would advise everyone not to use their services.",0
I have been without service for two weeks. Apparently engineers are still examining my account. When I joined I ported my number over. I was allocated a temp sim in the interim. That temp sim they then made my permanent. Trying to undo that stuff up has been sheer hell and nobody at Vodafone could give a monkeys. I’m now paying for a service I can’t use. Vodafone don’t reach out with updates or offer any solutions or recompense. I can’t cancel the account or port my number to a different carrier as it supposedly doesn’t exist on their network. Vodafone is the definition of incompetence and customer apathy. Im literally being extorted right now with seemingly no remedy in sight.,0
"Broadband internet has done nothing but disconnect 4-5 times a day for the last few weeks. Tried different routers. Tried different sockets. Still the same thing. Ring up Vodafone ""Nothing is wrong on our end, please give us access to your camera so we can see your router."" I say no because I don't have a phone that can do that. ""Then we can't assist you."" Garbage service, EE cost more but they were a lot more helpful than the ""Tech Experts"" they have for this joke of a company. Even whilst writing this it has disconnected yet again. God awful. Can't wait for my contract to be up so I can switch to someone else.",0
"Terrible customer experience. I bought a phone last Wednesday from Vodafone which was meant to come with an e-sim. Nothing has been issued so i cannot make calls, text or use data. I provided my PAC code at the point of purchase to transfer my number from O2. On Friday O2 disconnected my old mobile confirming the number had been transferred to Vodafone however Vodafone have not activated the esim on their end. I went into store and after waiting 45 mins to be seen, was told there was nothing the store could do as they can see on their system the e-sim is sat under ""processing"" on my Vodafone account and if i wait until 5pm I'd receive a QR code to activate.  No email was sent by vodafone.Today I have spent 30 mins on the phone with Vodafone customer service having to prove there is an issue before they would even look into my account.  Conclusion is they will now send me a physical sim and cancel the esim on their end.  I now have to wait another 48 hours in the hope a physical sim comes in the post.All the while Vodafone started a contract for me on 5 November and are charging me airtime for a phone that has no network! I cant make calls, cant text, no data. Yet you're charging me for it.  I wish i stayed with O2.  Avoid Vodafone at all costs.",0

12 days down the line hours wasted trying to contact Vodafone with 3 attempts to send a router but still nothing. Our connection line now seems to have a block on it so we can’t even take out Broadband with another company. Which is made even harder with no telephone line or internet. Told I would receive compensation but only if I stayed with Vodafone…!!!!????Last review told me contact Vodafone via Facebook to discuss which has just wasted more time. I really wish I could review -5* here,0
"My partner and her daughter went in only to get another SIM card for a new phone because the one in her existing phone was a micro and the new phone needed a nano in order to transfer the number and contacts over. The sales person seemed ONLY interested in selling a contract to her. Then proceeded to tell her that her existing number was inactive and no longer in service. Which I knew was a lie because we had tried to transfer the number and contacts and couldn't because there was no SIM in the new phone. Prior to that, Vodafone sent a security code to the existing phone number in order to allow the transfer of the number and contacts to a new SIM. Which is how we knew that her number was still active.Misleading and lying to customers. Should and will be reported to Vodafone head office.",0
My broadband speed is terrible on an evening. Great during the day getting 900mb. In the evening 20mb. Customer service is terrible they just blame you. Still got nearly 2 years left stuck with this awful service. With BT for 5 years didn't have to call them once. Don't be sucked in by cheap offers. Their network is dire and the customer service is even worse.Update- thank u for replying but nobody at vodafone will help they're utterly useless now stuck for the best part of 2 years with terrible broadband,0
"If you have issues with Vodafone, report them to Ofcom (their regulator) by searching “Complain about mobile, phone or internet services” on Google. Select your issue (billing, faults or service problems, etc) and click the link: ‘let us know by filling out our short monitoring form’. Nothing changes unless we notify Ofcom of their failings.UPDATE: Yesterday, Vodafone said the line was finally active (18 days after it was transferred to their network, one day after their supposed final, final, FINAL deadline). Plot twist: it still is NOT working. They are trying to bill us £13.87 for the same non-functional line. Of that £13.87, future me apparently incurred additional charges of £3.87 on 21 November (it’s 10 November). We still did not receive the call promised on 8 November 2024 from the manager of our case handler (Emma). The agent we spoke to yesterday (Ahmed) promised a callback and then flashed us so the system would register that he tried to call even though he had no intention of actually speaking to us. Ahmed sent a text message to ‘SIM swap’, but when we followed the instructions, the website and app said there was an error. They have still denied the PAC code and the deadlock letter.Background: On Monday 21 October, Vodafone said that after 24 to 48 hours, the telephone number (used for over ten years) would be transferred to their network at a much better rate. On Wednesday 23 October 2024, the telephone line transferred into the Vodafone network and stopped working. To this day (10 November 2024), there still isn’t any network at all. My partner and I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone with them. Each time, we are told by various agents (Sarah, Mo, Emma, and so many others) to wait 24-48 hours. Now we have to add a 24-hour wait to speak to a manager when it was previously instant. We requested the PAC code to switch networks on 1 November 2024. To date, we do not have the PAC code for the line (even though Ofcom say it should be provided within a maximum of two hours after the end of the call). We asked for a letter of deadlock to report them to Cisas. They refused to provide one.Reply to pending Vodafone response: It’s been 19 days, and the so-called technical issue has neither been resolved nor explained (complaint 122386655). To top that off, Vodafone wants to charge me over £13 for a line that never worked. It's funny how there’s always a higher department whenever we call to complain. I, of course, responded to their email, yet we still do NOT have a functional telephone line.Please take note, everyone – this is how they pass you around like a hot potato, hoping you’ll just give up.",0
"Vodafone - No, I won't communicate with your Social Media team.  That's what you did the last time to take it out of sight of the public and still the problem persists.  I want to speak with a management level human being who can get this fixed once and for all.  I said the same thing to the social media person who contacted me on X.  And the discussions will be put on TrustPilot so Vodafone actually deals with the issue and fixes it.--I thought we had this worked out.  But again - Vodafone cancelled FIVE attempts to top up my mobile number - using 2 different cards - online from my account and calling in to Customer Service.  Aside from the fact that the Customer Service Rep had no interest in listening to what I was saying - I WANT TO KNOW WHY VODAFONE IS NOT ACCEPTING MY PAYMENT.  There is no problem with money in either card.  I have been successfully paying ONLINE and via the SAME phone number for 3 months.  Now - out of the blue - the same problems again!  What IS the issue???  4 Days to get this sorted.  I have money left on the account and 13 GB of data on this account.  Contact me on the number.",0
"Dreadful experience with Vodafone broadband. Don't fall for the price and gurentrees of speeds.I live in a medium sized house and the internet only works in the same room as the router and it's painfully slow.Trying to get in contact with customer service is like banging your head on the brick wall. The 24/7 available 'Tobi' AI chat bot is never online when you're logged in as an existing customer, but very much online when you're not logged in and not a customer.I wish I never left Virgin Media (which is something I thought I'd ever be saying)",0
"Just a follow up on my earlier review about Vodafone , conveniently  for them , they cannot find a recording of an important conversation between myself and one of their agents and the latest agent I have been dealing  with has basically been lying to me .The agents you speak to are working from their homes ,in India , and by the sounds in the background I seriously think one of them was sitting on the beach .This used to be a good company that provided great customer service but now you will find it difficult to understand one of their representatives never mind get a good service from them .Do not stress yourself out , avoid Vodafone and use a company that appreciates you .",0

"I received my PAC code in a text, along with my Early Termination Fee (ETF). I'd like to ask, given the above, why am I being asked to pay the next instalment on my monthly bill? I've used my PAC code to join another provider, and as far as as I'm concerned. with the exception of the final bill, I shouldn't be paying anything more, or am I being asked to reinstate my DD so that Vodafone can just suck the ETF from my account without any notice, and potentially leave me in debt? I don't think so!",0
Local mast broke in February. Peripatetic texts from Vodafone to say “we are working hard … blah blah blah” Then radio silence. It took 7 MONTHS for the mast to apparently be repaired and yet we still have no signal. Useless bot on website. Can’t talk to a human being. What am I paying for? I think I’m going to move to another supplier who might be better. It’s a shame as Vodafone used to be great.,0

"I am extremely disappointed with Vodafone's broadband service and customer support. We were promised Pro II Fibre 2 for £30 per month with a download speed of 60 Mbps, but now the only speed available in our flat is up to 25 Mbps, while the other nine flats in the building receive speeds of up to 74 Mbps. To make matters worse, we are being charged £36 per month instead of the agreed price. This is a blatant failure to deliver on the terms of the agreement.The customer service experience has been appalling. The chat support was an absolute failure—inefficient, unhelpful, and a total waste of time. From agents to managers, every person I spoke to lied, dodged responsibility, and offered no real solutions. Despite repeated attempts to resolve these issues, there has been no improvement, and it is clear that our concerns are not being taken seriously.What makes it even worse is that Vodafone is quick to enforce their company policies when it comes to overcharging customers, but they completely fail to keep their end of the bargain. This experience has been nothing but frustrating and demonstrates a total disregard for customer needs.Vodafone has shown a complete lack of professionalism, honesty, and accountability. I expected better from such a large company, but this has been disheartening. I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on this experience. They need to urgently address these issues and honour the promises made to their customers.",0
Let me start by saying this.... if it was possible to give minus 10* rating I would. I wouldn't recommend vodafone to my worst enemy. The customer service is shit.... the vodafone provider is shit. I've made well over 20 calls in two years regarding there service. I've had to have 3 new boosters I've had to switch the router on and off pretty much every few days. I've had to fully reset the router lost count on that. I'm so happy my contract has ended I'm now going to take the router and the boosters and take a hammer to them and once I've done that I'll set them on fire and then I'll piss on them. I think after that I'll be happy.... VODAFONE STICK YA SHIT BROADBAND UP YOUR ARSE YOU USELESS C**TS. KIND REGARDSJay smith 🖕,0
"On Monday 21 October, Vodafone said that after 24 to 48 hours, the telephone number (used for over ten years) would be transferred to their network at a much better rate. On Wednesday 23 October 2024, the telephone line transferred to the Vodafone network and stopped working. To this day (9 November 2024), there still isn’t any connection. My partner and I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone with them. Each time, we are told by various agents (Sarah, Mo, Emma, and so many others) to wait 24-48 hours.

To date, we do not have the PAC code for the line (even though Ofcom say it should be provided within a maximum of two hours after the end of the call). We asked for a letter of deadlock to report them to Cisas. They refused to provide one.UPDATE: Yesterday, Vodafone said the deadline to recreate the line on the account was 8 November. The line still does not have access to the network. Vodafone said the manager of Emma (our case handler) would call and speak to us within 24 hours. When we called back (since we never received the call) the agent said a manager tried to call at 16:30. That call was never received to date. They have still denied the PAC code and the deadlock letter.From one customer to another, it's not worth the stress of the ordeal. The potential savings are not worth the risk of losing your number (potentially forever). Compensation of a minimum of £9.76 a day (search: automatic compensation Ofcom) is inadequate. Not accessing health services for you and your family. Missing personal calls. Not speaking to family and friends. Missing business calls, especially if you are self-employed. All in the hopes that the line will be re-established in the ever-elusive 24-48 hours is just not worth it.We also noted that the broadband connection constantly fails in the middle of the night for about an hour, sometimes longer. The sales representative said it’s because they fix network issues at night. So, if you like a 24-hour broadband connection, look somewhere else.Reply to pending Vodafone response: I have spoken to the Vodafone team on numerous occasions (complaint 122386655). I have no interest in another conversation on Facebook, X or anywhere else. I have, of course, called and texted for the PAC code for the line, which has been continuously denied. I also, of course, reached out to the complaints team for the letter, which was denied. Please take note, everyone – this is how they pass you around like a hot potato, hoping you’ll just give up.",0

"Switched to Vodafone with BIG regrets. My City Fibre engineers inspected my installation to check for faults and concluded that the reason for not getting my contracted speeds was down to a faulty router which they reported back to Vodafone. They will not send out a replacement and all communications have hit a brick wall. Vodafone are in breach of their contract but dont want to know. So payments halted. Avoid !Following their reply below, i have since installation date communicated with the store, Arte robot, various expert agents, personal managers and Twitter and have a stream of correspondants and open tickets all saying ""i will help and sort this for you, please stay connected"" when in fact every person i have engaged with apart from City Fibre who support my case, are designed to wear you down by putting up a breeze block wall and not help whatsoever. They wont listen to you or City Fibre when you simply need a replacement router! Complete Madness, Best way is to stop paying them but even that so far hasnt worked. Better still stay clear of Vodafone you will regret it.Ok so senior complaints involved now and a very polite lady called to say a new router is on its way and offered compensation. New router is worse than the original (kind of expected) but now Advisors say case is closed.The penny dropped. The router i have is not faulty but simply not fit for pupose. It will never reach the contracted speeds that City Fibre advise. The idea is you are forced to upgrade and pay more but even then if i thought it would work i am sure it wouldnt with faith lost in Vodafone. Glad i didnt buy the alltogether mobile phones as well! Refused to pay anymore and asked to be released from contract.",0

"Vodaphone experience over a 5 hour period....  If I could give them zero stars I would. Original aim was to purchase a Broadband deal, then change two mobile contracts to Vodaphone too. However, I will not be using Vodaphone for Broadband or as a Mobile Phone Provider, or recommend them.1. 10:00 hrs start: Website on 4 x attempts [over 1 hr] would not accept my broadband order.2. Website directed me to sales team phone number. Took me 15 mins to connect to team. Sales told me website doesn't work anyway. Spent another 30 mins giving same details to operator. Operator then told me that an order could not be placed because my current provider would not switch without me actioning the switch myself. When website states switch process is 'hassle free, done by Vodaphone.3. I contacted my current provider [5 minute call] who said Vodaphone had informed them of switch which was already in progress.4. Approx 12:00hrs:  I was now very frustrated. I contacted Vodaphone again via chat to confirm no order had been submitted via website or phone. Requested confirmation no order had been place, and no action would be taken to progress an order. Note that since approx 11:00 hrs I had received 5 text messages from Vodaphone telling me a date for installation.5. Operator on chat very unhelpful. Said order had been placed for my address, but would not cancel order, or give me order number.6. On my request, chat directed me to a complaints link on a web page with a phone number. The automated messages do not allow you to speak to anyone without an order number. I had placed no order, received no emails, and text messages just redirected me to same website link.7. I phoned my current provider, [Talk Talk] where I spoke to a real person, who was very understanding and contacted Vodaphone themselves, and then connected me to the Vodaphone complaints department who then wanted to run through a new order. By this time an email from Vodaphone had landed with a Web reference number.8. The only person 5 hours later, in Vodaphone Technical Team was Jamil who was professional and courteous, who confirmed he had cancelled the order whilst I was speaking. But, was unable to confirm his action via email with me. I took his word for it. Silly me!9. 36 hour later I then receive a text to say a direct debit has been set up with Vodaphone.So, figuratively speaking I have lost the will to live with Vodaphone. Awful, unco-ordinated web content, sales and complaints departments, left hand to right hand don't know what they are doing and there is no efficient responsive human complaints department.Outcome... I have stayed with my current provider Talk Talk, who kindly offered me a free Firestick for the hassle another provider caused as by the 5 hour mark I was in tears with frustration about Vodaphone.",0

"I stayed with Vodafone for as long as I could. During the last three years I have had multiple problems with WIFI coverage in my house despite being promised by Vodafone WIFI experts that the problem had been resolved. I spent hours of my time chatting via the chatbot who I eventually felt I knew personally. Boosters were the answer, and so i ordered three. Only to find that boosters were not the answer and the problems continued. Boosters in the wrong position was the next explanation, wrong again. After repositioning all the boosters, unplugging, plugging back in, pressing the reset button (don't forget to have a pin handy) hold the WPS button on the router for three seconds, stand on one leg and all good. Not this time, the problems returned. OK try unplugging all the boosters, bring them close to the router, plug them all in (if you are lucky enough to have enough plug sockets) press the reset button for three seconds and the WPS button for three seconds on the router, repeat for each booster then leave to settle. Bingo, you are good to go and by the way you will never have WIFI coverage issues again. Next day, same issue. Patience is wearing thin now so please can we sort this or I am cancelling. OK one last try we can see the problem lies with the router so we will send you a new one. Sure enough a new router was left on the doorstep. What now? well just set up the new router and away you go. Back onto my friend chatbot who again asked me for all my personal details, I was quite upset as I thought he would remember me. Anyway he talked me through the set up and explained it would take a few hours for the booster to pair with the new router. No such luck. So finally I called to cancel the contract only to be told that it would take a month to complete. I said fine I'm unplugging the router and boxing up the boosters so please cancel from today. One month later I received a do not reply email asking for my outstanding months payment for the service that was not working. Back to Chatbot who put me through to billing dept. Very sorry to hear you are leaving and we completely understand your reasons but rules are rules and you do indeed owe a final months payment for a service we did/could not provide. Oh and for good measure if you don't cough up we will give you a bad credit rating and you will never be given any sort of finance again. So pay up and shut up seems to be the strap line. Good bye and good riddance Vodafone.",0

Installation due today. No router delivered and no explanation or apology from company. No human contact - complete silence. I wonder whether this company actually exists.

Still no resolution and they keep undoing each others work in trying to resolve this. Was first told it could take 2 hours to resolve, then 24 and latest call said 72 hours.

"Where do I start…I am exhausted! It has been over 2 months when I am trying to leave Vodafone and I am asking to be disconnected but no one can do it for me! It’s crazy!4/09/2024 I called Vodafone uk letting them know I am moving and I want to finish my contract. On the phone they said all is done and they will disconnect me on tie 04/10/2024 I have also received a confirmation email believing all is sorted.03/10 I have received text from Vodafone informing my plan will continue at £28 per month I was surprised and called the again asking why I have received a text. Lady in the phone said my cancellation been cancelled and they will deal with it immediately and will disconnect me in 24-48h. She apologised and said it will never happen again. I believed this time I am being disconnected for sure as mistakes might happen but surely now they will deal with it.03/11/2024 I have received a text from V with information I have 2 outstanding bills-£73!!! It was Sunday morning I called V and I was not happy!!! I have said how is this even possible if I called 2 months ago and they still generate the bill! I have been informed my cancellation has been cancelled AGAIN!!! I demanded to speak to manager, been told I will receive a call in 24h it did not happen! So I called them on Monday explaining for the 4th time I want to be disconnected as I called 2 months ago and no one deals with my request and I don’t know who I can talk to. They finally transferred me to manager. All I can say useless!!! She did not know why I am still their customer but she transferred me to tech department saying “make sure they disconnect you” pardon me ?? “ you make sure it’s all sorted as you are a manager!!!” After spending 1h on the phone someone finally said all will be done in 48h please call us to make sure disconnection has been processed. I called on Wednesday 6/11/24 guess what they are still charging me and supplying (where I don’t even live at the address) cos there was a system error and I am not disconnected!!!! So for the 6th time I had to explain and repeat myself what’s going on spend on the phone over 1h was on the hold for good 45 min during the whole call. The person who served me said “you will be disconnected in 24 h you don’t have to call us again we will text you and send an email” guess what no email or text looks like will have to call them again tmrw! Waste of the time and customer service really bad! Everyone is lying and repeating the same lines!! Can anyone advise me how to take it further cos my customer’s right are breached and I feel like I am a hostage of Vodafone!!!!",0

"The most poorly designed UX for an app i've ever come across.Live chat disconnects every 30 seconds. When it reconnects you're told that the chat has now ended and you have to start all over again.Consistent app-related issues (incredible for a tech company). I can't make payment within the app - whether new card or saved card - the loading button never actually follows through. Yet on the desktop site it works well.Abandoned payments should be a metric you guys are aware of - it tells me you aren't monitoring the UX of your app at all. You add on missed payment fees with a ""friendly reminder that paying on our app is quick and easy"". It isn't.Customer service ""you can avoid these issues by setting up a direct debit""...okay, but it shouldn't be necessary: frictionless mobile payments is an incredibly basic requirements in 2024.",0

Worst experience ever.. the way Vodafone treats there customers is very sick they send workers to people's houses who leave live hanging out the wall And they send workers that talk about drugs... When you complain about it and tell Vodafone that you lost food due to having to turn off the power in the house because of the live wire they force you and your family to eat out of bins till they want to sort it I would stay away from this company or your be next been caught in Vodafones trap they are unprofessional and they make me sick,0
Terrible. Vodafone operate a scam. I signed up to Vodafone Broadband and was meant to receive a £105 Giftcloud gift card. Not received. Giftcloud say it is for Vodafone to sort.

They sent me sigmnal booster which does nothing and supposed to call back after few days...guess what? Internet still drops out and no one cares. Im just waiting until my contract ends and will go for other provider.P.s. whoever designed they broadband test&diagnostic need to rethink if they are right person for the job.Once my internet drops out Im going to Vodafone broadband app to do the service check.

Terrible phone call customer services.  My contract is due to end. All I wanted to do was renew and see what money I could save with new contract. Since i being with vodafone since 2010 .

if you are on a pay as you go plan and run out of data and want a different its worse than pulling teeth best you can find on google is to opt out of current one but no way to buy anorther one if you want to buy anorther one nope needs a new number you can order and finding a number to talk to someone is like pulling teeth ill be leaving,0
they are rubbish no signal in 2024 what a joke,0
No back up when needed.  I moved broadband to Vodafone and Openreach came to install cables.  The first engineers didn't do a good job and cable broke on the second day with internet not working.  Another team was called.  The internet is working but the cable was dug up .... maybe by foxes and loops upwards in the front garden instead of being attached along the garden wall as discussed.  Trying to get anyone to organise has been impossible.  The sales team were great when it came to selling the product but don't trust the backup - behind the scenes is abysmal.,0
"Vodafone didn't give me the service paid for, horrible reception, no ended calls, messages, don't make it easy to change for another product to keep the client and is still charging me a fine for a service that doesn't work. Anyways, after procedures, tests, changing devices and blablabla nothing worked.  Since July having trouble. they don't have access to the reference chats, the tests that they have done, the investigation that they did, nothing! But I have the chat copy, so feel free to ask me and I will show you. So if you are reading this, go for BT, O2 or other provider that will give you a good service for what you are paying for. Bad experience and now taking VOdafone to the court.",0
"I noticed I was being charged quite a lot for my Vodafone bill. I decided to check this out, and discovered I was still paying for my previous contract for the past year.I contacted Vodafone regarding this, and they explained that once the contract ends you move onto a rolling contract which I wasn’t notified about as all information was sent to my old phone number, which had been inactive since around the time my contract ended.The colleague I spoke to understood my point of view and tried to help me. I explained that I would be satisfied with even half of the money returned to me (around £350). He then told me he would cancel the contract and to ring back in 30 days to see if a reimbursement is possible.Fast forward 30 days, after a nearly 1 hour phone call I was told it still hadn’t been ended and I’d need to wait 7 - 10 working days (after already waiting 30.)Just after a week later; I followed up on a missed call from Vodafone. To my dismay, I was offered £50 compensation. This is offensive considering it’s not even 10% of the money that has been taken out of my bank for a phone I wasn’t using.Also, being a loyal customer to Vodafone it was disappointing to say the least. I’ve asked for this case to be escalated since the last person I spoke with didn’t do it. The customer service has been substandard and I am hesitant to bring a customer of Vodafone again.If a satisfactory resolution is met I’ll be happy to alter my review and stance on this company.",0
"I wrote a review yesterday about Vodafone’s poor customer service. I received a reply asking me to contact them. The 2 websites given to me both said they didn’t exist and so I tried ringing the number I was given. This number didn’t recognise me or my number, said goodbye and hung up. It would seem Vodafone cannot even operate their own customer service when you act on their instructions",0
"Appalling communicationI cancelled my account, some of the worst policies out there when it comes to cancellation.",0
"Ordered broadband. Received a call the next day there was a problem with the order, they needed to cancel it. Just redo the order. Did everything, got all emails and text notifications. Then no one shows up for installation.Ask customer services- they respond that it was cancelled because the order didn't go through. What does this mean? They don't know I should call another department. Honestly absolutely shocking won't be ever using them for broadband. What a joke",0
"Very disappointed about the customer service we received in our local vodaphone store earlier this week ,As an individual who works in retail management and knows about good quality costumer service I was shocked at the way we were dealt with ,We were going into vodaphone as we needed some help with leaving the company because we’ve had nothing but bad service throughout our 7 years with them , when we explained our situation to the staff he just shrugged it off saying there’s nothing I can do , completely understand if this isn’t something you provide in store anymore however abit of help would’ve been nice to explain to us how we go about doing it , considering there were 5 staff members in the shop all sat there doing nothing I was shocked no one came forward and offered some advice on how to leave the contract however they were clearly to busy on their phonesI hope there is some training given to these staff members to understand basic customer service or even just taught how to smile at customers ,I am glad I’ve left my phone contract from here and I know I will not be the only one leaving after this :)",0
"I've been with them since August 2023 and this is the third major bad experience of their customer service. I'm reasonably tech savvy and I've had wifi issues with their hubs and extenders before. To be fair things have been going OK for in the past three months. Today all I wanted was to be able get get their ""award winning broadband app"" to connect to the hub. Instead, as a result of speaking to 2 VF reps, I spent spending nearly two hours on the phone whilst my wifi was down between 2.30 and 7.30 pm.  In addition they simply cannot keep a promise on calling me back. The first time I was told to expect someone to call me back within mins 10 mins but no one got back after an hour, within 10-20 mins and waited 36 mins (ok, thats not so bad) and was told to expect a call within an hour and am still waiting (its now 21.15 they should have got back by 19.35 and the lines will be closed!) This is crap customer service!",0
I would advise everybody never ever go to Vodafone worst provider I’ve ever been with with home broadband no internet for 3 days was on the phone continuously and the customer service team kept hanging up on me so I decided to go somewhere else instead after 5 years of hell I’m feel like I’ve been released from prison,0
Absolutely garbage service I can't get through they want 575 for a service I'm not receiving I want the fee waived,0
The worst boardband company the internet just stops all of a. Sudden then you cal up Customer service most of the time they don't no what's going on you have to repeat your self a 100 times and then they make you wait for 20min then again they ask what can I help with. Not acceptable behaviour from a big company like Vodafone,0
"Ordered apple warch ultra 2 and Apple iPhone 16 pro max with 1 tb in black titanium. Ordered it on 30th of September which suggested it would take 3-4 weeks. And i was okay with that. Now it has been over 5 weeks, still no updates. When you try to reach out to the team the answer remain the same that they have stock issue and they are just provider and it depends on the apple itself to deliver the stocks. My question is, if you have stock issues why you have made available those devices and states the timeline of the delivery? Why do you perform hard search on any individual with this level of confusions that you have within your company. Now you have performed hard search and it will stay on my file for next six months or more. And you will say just sorry if I cancel the order. This should not be like this. You realise the seriousness of these credit searches right?Guys anyone reading this, please stay away from these clowns, and do not go with positive comments, those are likely to be paid ones. One of the worst service provider. No transparency at all.",0
"Vodafone were doing maintenance  for over a month my internet was none existent or buffing I bought an EE sim to cover me whilst the work was on going I rang VodaF this morning after receiving  a txted the work was fininshed it took me 40min to receive a £10.00 credit , that wont cover the EE sim cost the lady on the phone had me on hold most of the time I Im done with Vodafone the way I was treated for their sub standard service is to much hassle ..I txted Giff Gaff for a friend her account received the full months payment without question Vodafone  are lacking big time Ive been with them over 10 yrs bye bye",0
"My web order number is WEB-0001000040598605. Joined with a SIM only deal on the 7th of October. What a big mistakeI I can't make outgoing calls because the Wifi Calling isn't stable, and when making an outbound call, it takes around 30 seconds or more to connect. I should've learned my lesson from a few years back, when I ended up having to pay this company £2K for two rubbish contracts. What Vodafone also don't tell you is that the majority of their shops are franchises, by this I mean that someone moves into an empty shop, gets phones from Vodafone, puts their branding around the shop, and the Vodafone name above the door, but doesn't have a vested interest in customer service, or anything to do with selling devices. Also, when you decide to end your contract early, by way of a PAC or STAC code, you get a text from Vodafone, saying that ""your early termination fee is £x"", it doesn't tell you how this is worked out, or if it's VAT exempt, or when, and if VAT will be added at all, or when the final bill is produced, which in my opinion, is just a backhanded way of legally robbing customers of their cash.",0
"So Vodafone here we are again. I thought we had gone our separate ways but like an ex that can't let go you spring up in the corner of the bar I frequent with my pals. I've moved on Vodafone, I'm in a new and exciting relationship with plusnet. I think you should move on too instead of sending me a letter claiming I owe you a month like an ex wife trying to claim csa and draw the last bit of blood I have. I have a settlement agreement from you stating you were rubbish and didn't treat me right and that we can part ways. So much so it's actually you that owes me a month. I've packed my stuff Vodafone and I've gone. It's time for you to find someone else. I wish you all the best but I'm happy with plusnet.",0
"Work with onecom to scam small businesses.They sell Sim only contracts at £123 a month through Onecom, they don’t have sim only contracts that are that expensive on their own websites, so I’m not sure what that extra money is for…except for making as much profit as possible.They have this really ridiculous system where they sell you a cheaper contract which Vodafone charges you for, and onecom refunds the difference but what they mis-sell you on is that it’s a 3 year contract ( or whatever length it is) but they only give you the refund for 17 months and it’s up to you, the customer to be aware of this, remember, and ring them to say you’d like them to continue the discount. But at no point are you told this is what must happen.We weren’t given a cooling off period as we were a business even though we explained the sims were unusable due to no signal; instead of fixing the issue we were sent a dongle which was meant to be a gesture of goodwill, instead we were charged for the dongle and another SIM card to use in the dongle.We get invoices from Vodafone each month and yet you’re unable to contact them as they state you have no contract with them.It’s disgusting, they’ve ruined my business and my mental health",0
I'm leaving a Negative feedback as my boardband Contract has just ended with no Communication and a bill saying we are charging you this this month as I'm out of Contract . I'm applying to Virgin now . Cheaper by far  . You don't just charge someone a higher price without Communication . . I'll also be leaving Vodafone mobile due to this been with ya for 5 years . It's a f u and bye,0
"Placed a Broadband Order, Got Confirmation for install this Friday(Order Placed 2 Weeks ago). tried to track delivery of Router but was told that the order was cancelled and they didn't know why. Useless customer service and next available date of install is 19 November, won't do that now as they might mysteriously cancel it",0
"My contract was coming to an end and I was advised to have a 3 month sim then visit the store after Christmas for a better deal. When Covid came and lockdown I tried to deal with this online. I had been a customer for about 20 years and wanted to stay. Vodafone would only offer a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford and I mentioned 02 were offering a 3 year deal. I was told if I wasn’t happy I should go to O2 then. My phone wasn’t working properly and I wanted to keep my number and  being a pensioner and disabled I needed a working phone. I told Vodafone I was leaving but again they weren’t helpful so I got a phone from O2. Vodafone said they weren’t informed and charged me for a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford to pay. In spite of several letters, emails and phone calls Vodafone couldn’t have cared less. Only interested in making money, very poor customer service. I could only do so much, I couldn’t go to the store for help because of lockdown so what more could I have done? I now need a loan to get my roof fixed as I’ve got water coming in and I’m losing my winter fuel allowance. I can’t get a loan as I have this so called ‘bad debt’ on my credit report . This is a very unfair way to treat a customer who didn’t even want to leave but was told to go. Vodafone need to look at how they treat customers.",0
I tried to top up my sim card in my wifi dongle. Although the transaction went through the credit did not go onto my sim in dongle. I ended up spending all morning on their website and their facebook page to resolve the issue. Their security is obstructive and discriminates against me as an autistic person. They insist it much be done by text. I cannot use a phone because I cannot cope with unpredictability of phone calls. I do not own a phone of any kind. It took several attempts to get them to provide another method of security.I use the wifi dongle to send emails to get help when I am out. it is essential for my safetyThey would not provide any means to directly complain so could make the complaint that I actually wanted to. The changed my complaint I made.All I want is when I top up for it to go directly onto the sim card. Vodafone and their customer service make it as difficult as possible.I had tried to top it up using one of the methods sugested on links. The credit did not go on my sim and it took all the next morning to get credit on my sim. I cannot top up via account (the other suggested method) I don't have a phone so I cannot recieve text messages to variefy the account. Again this is all very unhelpful. I don't use a phone because the unpredicatabily of phone call overwealms me often causing me to have autistic meltdowns. I use sim it dongle to send emails in an emergency. This is to keep me safe.,0
"I’m not one for reviews but i’d hate for others to waste precious minutes (or hours & days) on this earth dealing with vodafone’s customer service. I can give you brief summary of it now if you are considering their broadband. “We are very sorry and we will ensure we investigate this so that it does not ever happen again” then they do it again.The full & honest story behind my need to vent with a review -I placed an order for full fibre broadband. As agreed, the equipment shows up and on the day they say, great! but i noticed that there is no actual fibre modem in the property and i have no engineer booked. Odd but i give them a call to double check they’ve sent everything. Sure enough, there has been an understandable mistake - they tested the line to make sure the ONT (fibre connection) was active and working and sent out just the wifi hub. Between testing the line and the previous owner moving out though, the previous owner had disconnected the ONT and also sent that back which they weren’t supposes to. Frustrating but not vodafones fault and as my line isn’t going active for another few days, it’s no biggy, they’ll get someone out to fix it so it’s ready…wrong! They can’t raise it as a fault with city fibre as it’s not actually an active line yet.Pretty frustrating also but again, understandable i guess. The guy, who was really friendly say’s he’ll ring me back first thing on Monday when the line becomes active and get me a next day appointment. Sure enough he rings at 6pm that day as agreed but it turns out he can’t book an appointment with city fibre, he has to email them and they respond within 48hrs with an appointment within 48hrs of that.More frustration but ok, lets let it work itself out….8 days later and after calling literally daily, still no engineer, still no broadband, still no reason why as apparently people have been calling but i haven’t been answering! What had actually been happening is they were calling my 13yr old daughters phone number while she was in school and her phone doesn’t accept calls. I’d never given them that number regarding my broadband or phone number order but because i have an account for her phone, that had became the default contact number… except it hadn’t when they were calling me back to say how sorry they were daily with the screen written apologies?Fast forward to a few more days later when i’ve taken two days off work for the engineers who were definitely going to show up but didn’t because they had no contact details for me and after all the confusion an out of hours city fibre rings my actual phone number and has me up and running in half an hour around two weeks after my activation.Now that was a really bumpy start and the £16 in compensation they offered me felt very generous for two weeks of feeling like i was harrassing them and two days off work (self employed) but in fairness the broadband was bulletproof. Great speeds up & down, no cutting out, no complaints at all.3 months in now and while i’m away on holiday i get a text to say my broadband is being cancelled and to call them if i want to keep it. Clearly a phishing scam i thought, they won’t catch me out though!…wrong! Today my broadband is being cut off, this review might not even make it to the internet if i don’t press send quick enough.After speaking to two customer service people, it turns out that “someone” has requested a broadband switch mistakenly and there’s nothing they can do about it. How unfortunate you might think, clearly he’s tried to find a better deal…nope.You can’t speak to customer services without confirming your full name, DOB, address, email and favourite dinner before they text you a one time passcode but any old person can apparently just request to swap your broadband.The other wonderful thing is they’re going to send me a bill for 15 months of the remaining contract for my troubles.You couldn’t make up how bad their customer care is, everybody is sorry and everybody is emailing other people to get answers but nobody ever does. It’s genuinely the worst customer service i’ve ever experienced by a big margin. I beg you, don’t use them. The product is great when it’s working but i promise it’s not worth the headache of trying to deal with their customer service if you have a problem it really isn’t and i’m not a “complainer”. I get there’s red tape, i get that there’s a process to follow but i can tell you hand on heart if there is a minor problem with the service you will regret ignoring this review and you’ll message me one day soon to say steve, you were right.**updated since vodafone have replied**What you can see below is what i would call “classic vodafone”. Zero ownership of an issue, it’s always a case of can you contact another team, who then contact another team and ultimately you have to chase everyone while getting nowhere. Beyond awful.",0
"In November 2023, I ordered broadband, received the kit, booked an installation date, and then... nothing. No contact from the provider on the scheduled Friday. I called them on Monday, only to be told my order had been canceled because they couldn't actually provide broadband in my area. I filed a complaint, but it didn’t get resolved.Then in April 2024, I received an email about possible compensation. After spending hours in chat, I was told I wasn’t eligible for compensation after all. Later, I was informed I could claim compensation, but only for a few days. They blamed it on an automated system sending out emails indiscriminately. Here’s the kicker: I was marked as an inactive user at the time, so either someone made a mistake, or the system has serious issues (Skynet vibes?).The irony? My neighbor in the terraced house next door has no problem ordering broadband, but every time I check for mine, it’s unavailable. After spending two more hours in chat, bouncing between departments, I got nowhere. My next step is OFCOM—at this point, Vodafone owes me around £2,000 in compensation.",0
"Twice in just 3 months , internet crashed . No connection. The customer service at the phone ask too many questions about identification, not just the account number and it takes long time at the phone saying the same thing over and over again before finally ( as I said from the beginning) an engineer is booked. The engineer is booked only for the outside service but as always it turns out to be a problem inside the house, so after the first 72 h , I need to wait other 72h to get a engineer to come home!!Not a reliable service!!!",0
"Well , I've just moved my home broadband to VodaFone and tonight I have had my first interaction were I'm trying to get support for logging into my account so I can set up the equipment. I wish I could give a zero. The outcome from support was I should try again later when I asked if I could make a complaint I was told it could take 20-30 mins did I still want to do that, when I said yes there response was I need to provide input every 3-5 mins I asked multiple time if the person was there and was finally reponded to. The operator has said they will make a complaint and someone MAY call me within 10 days but they could not provide any details or reference number to track my complaint. As my first interaction from a new supplier I am very less than impressed, I will try again later but if I still cant get the system working I'll be cancelling my contract in the 14 days allowed. Very poor performance and not good first impressions.",0
"Absolutely disgusted with Vodafone's treatment of us after placing an order to switch our broadband to them from another supplier.Following the initial confirmation email on October 12th I subsequently heard nothing back from them. When the scheduled the date for the installation passed I contacted them asking for an explanation and was told that I failed a credit check. This despite the fact that I have never been refused credit, that I have never been overdrawn or in debt, that I am not even asking for credit, and that i have been a vodafone broadband customer at my second home for the past 2 years. This was all the more annoying because they had not bothered to contact me in any way to inform me that the order had been rejected.Well Vodafone you have not only failed to gain another customer, you have lost one as well, because you can be absolutely sure that after this experience, when my contract at the second home expires I will be switching to another provider.",0
"Miserable, rude staff. 5 staff in the shop today all doing absolutely nothing but playing candy crush? Got passed onto a customer service phone number yet the guy on the phone said It could have been dealt with in store. Lazy. Unhelpful staff. Some real customer service training needs to be taken place in here and also maybe teach your staff how to smile? Terrible shop everytime we have come in - unfortunately it is our closest. Will be switching providers",0
"According to the Vodafone website, leaving customers would get the final bill within 30 days of the date of disconnection and refund, if any, would also be processed. After the said period, didn't received any bill or refund. Contacted Vodafone via their complaint page, received a call from their agent the next day and was asked a number of questions about personal details before the agent generated the final bill and sent it over. Was told that in order to get the refund, bank details were required. Gave the required details to the agent, though quite reluctantly, as those questions were very similar to those that your bank or police would alert you as being from a scammer. Anyway, got an email confirmation after a week saying that the refund had been processed and would reach my account in 3-5 days. A month passed, no refund. Contacted them via email and got a call back again asking the same set of questions. Didn't provide bank details this time and the agent just kept repeating that the details were required for arranging refund. Interestingly, at the beginning of every call they claimed that the call would be recorded, and I suppose from my previous communication with the other agent a month ago, there should be a record already, after all, they said the details were required for processing the refund. Now just as if the previous communication didn't exist, despite the confirmation email about the refund I received more than a month ago, I was asked the same set of questions for personal details. It's just ""surreal"". I gave up. They can keep my money, otherwise it's just like groundhog day.Response to Vodafone's social media team:Thanks for your response but I have no desire to answer the same set of questions again from someone seems to be from an offshore call centre. It also doesn't help that all of a sudden I received a scam test message from a +91 area code number, though it may have nothing to do with my recent experience.",0
"Went with them and ported my number over , previous provider gave me a better deal to stay and they were unable to give me a new PUK number making it impossible to leave them , I logged a complaint and then they cancelled my number and now I am unable to retreieve it even when I went into the shop with my ID as Ive been told to do for nothing , Very unhelpful never ever go with them",0
"Very bad experience. You actually pay for a 5G plan, but they provide speeds below 4G. When you try to cancel contract due to their poor network, they pass you from one agent to another and won’t allow cancellation unless you pay for penalties. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!",0
Waited in all day for my broadband installation. Received a message from vodaphone yesterday confirming an engineer would be here today. I was finally told it wasn’t being installed today after I phoned to see where the engineer was. Lack of communication between both Vodafone and the engineers (City fibre). I’ve cancelled and also lost a days work in the process. Annoyed is an understatement.,0
"Could not add my current number on a new contract , from 21/10/24 I was to have my number ported on new contract for 12 months but what I got was lost mobile number £12 charge no contract , I had to get payasugo sim from another network from 21/10/24 and my credit score lowered as well , complete useless in the end they just said can’t port your number and disconnect the contract line and charged me £12 for there mistakes",0
"This new Big Value Bundle is a rip off. As soon as I topped up my account, I had zero credit remain as the Big Value Bundle converted automatically.

No special offers just bills climbing up, when I asked for better rates answers was that I’m still on a contract nothing can be changedI think it’s time to change providers",0

"Awful! Don't even bother visiting. It needs shutting down. No staff, no customer service.Wasted my Saturday afternoon driving 45 mins there, 45mins back as it is the closest one to me, paid for parking and walked to the shop. All I wanted to do is return my old broadband dongle which vodafone told me to do since upgrading my broadband with them or they would charge me £40 if not done within 30days.no option to post this which I think is terrible but that's another story. When arrived the guy on the front deskbwith glasses on said if I take a seat they would be with me 10-20mins. They literally left me sat in a corner of the shop for nearly two hours. An Asian guy to be fair was seeing to a customer and was doing his job. The white guy with glasses on was sat chatting about park life festival and oasis gigs he's been to to another customer instead of delivering customer service. Coming up to 2 hours of waiting and could clearly see he was just chatting rubbish the full time I was in there I asked him can I leave the dongle with him as my parking ticket was running out. He said he can't as I have to be there with some IMEI number. I gave him this and then he started saying the system was down and I should go back another day when they're less busy!!!??? Absolutely awful. I work in customer service for British gas and there is no way this is an acceptable way to treat customers. He then told me to ring 191 when I was leaving. Don't worry pal I will be doing......and complaining about you and your awful service!!!just waiting for them to charge me £40 now for not returning the dongle which they have refused to take off me in store and given me no other way of returning it. If and when they do I will be reporting them to the FSA as I do wonder how many other customers are being charged these fees for not returning equipment they're unable to return due to Vodafone's terrible customer service. I suspect they're making a lot of money out of this and it needs investigating.",0
"I have the misfortune of having both my home broadband and mobile phone with Vodafone.Last Monday, 28th October 2024, I came home from work to find my WiFi wasn't working, so I went on and reported a fault- requesting an engineer to visit on Wednesday 30th. Said engineer decided not to bother showing up, incredibly frustrating since I'd taken time off work. That started a ridiculous chain of events featuring me contacting customer support and getting told a completely different story each time. First, on Wednesday, I was told that the supposed engineer had worked on the problem remotely and it would be fixed on Thursday. Then on Thursday I was told it was a network event and that it would be fixed latest on Friday.Then on Friday I was told that the engineer would need to come out to me and the earliest they could come would be Monday! That such blatant incompetence is allowed to exist is staggering to me. Additionally on Friday, I was at the office, but was told an advisor (Feddrik) would call me at 11.15 and could I head home. So I headed home only for this person not to call at all. I then contacted customer ""service"" back and was told to wait for a few hours and he would definitely call. I have better things to do than wait for him to call so I headed back to the office. He never called.Honestly, the contempt with which I've been treated is appalling and I honestly can't wait to take my business elsewhere.Well done Vodafone, you're so clever.",0
Signed up on the 10/10/24 for broadband and phone. Told router would be with me a few days before connection date on 30/10/24. Day before still nothing and after some looking found my router was being send back to Vodafone. Not communication about this so had to try to contact Vodafone. After over a hour of online chat windows someone from Vodafone confirmed it had been sent back and they would send another one out to be with me within 3 days…. 3 days have passed and no router. But I have been send a message saying my bill of £34 need paying on the 11/11/24. How can my 1st bill be ready after 12 days of when I should of been connected when on the evening of the 2/11/24 there is still no router?Also 30% of the reviews are 1* reviews. How can they have 4.5/5 score?,0

I had a very bad experience with vodafone in Haywards Heath on the 1st of Nov. I went in there to check on an order which I thought was done on 31st Oct at Haywards heath branch. The Customer service at haywards said the order was not completed on 31st Oct. Then She said you have two options cancel the order and thats it or start over again(which I spend two hr with my pregnant wife on 31st oct at store). The way they treated us on 1st of Nov was not right as I think as a customer when you spend time for a product you really want to buy the company should also make sure that the customer for their product is treated well and not come back and say you need to cancel it and do nothing. Instead to get the order sorted out they just wanted to cancel it and finish it. If vodafone doesn’t want customers to purchase phones from their outlets don't advertise saying you have got offers and so on. If you think customers can be treated like this then you’re wrong.Have been using for Vodafone for long and I would say Burgess Hill Store is better that HH.,0
"My partner recently upgraded her phone and traded in her old phone as part of the deal.She was told that she could drop her old phone in to any Vodafone store for her trade in to be processed.She went in to basildon retail store today, only to be seen by a woman who was not interested at all.The advisor said that they don't recieve trade ins in store, and turned her away which was a inconvenience.This is very poor customer service from the advisor who showed very little interest in helping.",0
"Abysmal service from Vodafone. Cannot wait to be out of contract and I will never use this company again in my life. We suffered download speeds of less than 1MB for 12 days, not enough to even open an email. I spent countless hours on the phone with them. Waited at home on a working day for router that didn’t arrive. Eventually the service resumed, and despite loosing £100s in income due to not being able to work at home, spending over £200 on alternative internet solutions and in coffee shops so we could use the internet to work, they called to offer us compensation…..of £5. Absolute joke.",0
Worst internet provider in UKInternet stops and you are left waiting 48 to be fixedIn the meantime there is nothing they do.They give out vouchers for a one Costa coffeeImagine if that happend gew times a month.AVOID AT ALL COST,0
Mahsoom was so rude he didn’t fix my issue and he said that we were rude because we spoke in our language he also kept on laughing at us,0
I popped in there today & they was really rude especially the lady I was speaking too had some issue about something but no help at all,0
"Absolutely terrible experience - don't believe these ""easy peasy"" to switch adverts - more like ""difficult difficult""!! It was the most frustrating experience! When the engineers came to install my fibre they cut my previous cable and then were not able to install the new cable due to some kind of blockage (fair enough, not their fault). They promised it would be all sorted next day (I explained to them I work from home so I need the internet). Well, I call vodafone up in the morning because no one has turned up and I had no communication whatsoever as to what is going on, when I finally manage to get through to someone they say it will be UP TO 5 WORKING DAYS! I asked if there's any way this can be expedited as I work from home and I need the internet, but no luck! Customer service is a shambles - just a bunch of people reading from a script and not helpful AT ALL. In the end we ended up sorting it out ourselves with CityFibre themselves who were brilliant and got us up and running the next day! So it could have been expedited, just not by vodafone!They then offered me £20 for my 2 days of missed work which is just insulting. Even more insulting?! When they actually paid it it was only £18 ! After spending 2 days pretty much non-stop on the phone with vodafone and CityFibre, I can safely say if we didn't sort this out ourselves with CityFibre we would still be without internet and none the wiser as to what is going on as vodafone themselves are clueless.If you do want to go with vodafone, you want to pray nothing ever goes wrong because good luck getting it sorted!",0
"If you are thinking about setting up a contract with Vodaphone, think again. I had sim only deals for my kids, and at the end of the contract, the prices are hiked up. I was organised and tried to cancel but they have made it almost impossible to do so. If you ring and want to book a new deal, no queues, if you want to ring to cancel, about 30 minutes queues. But i persisted and waited in the queue. Eventually i got through, the chap said to NOT CANCEL MY DIRECT DEBIT as i was owed money back, then they contianued to take another 2 months charges, at the higher rate. So next time, i cancelled the direct debit, and they sent it to a debt colelctor claiming i didnt give them 2 months notice, again, no chance of getting through if you want to cancel. On top of that, you cant port a number from one Vodaphone account to another vodaphone account, so when I got a more competative quote on a comparison site from a third party using vodaphone, and tried to change numbers to that, it couldn't be done, so they charged me for those numbers as well whilst i cancelled!! So i have paid several hundred pounds over and beyond, and they still reckon I owe another £100+. Absolute daylight robbery. I wish I had time and patience to sue them, just thought a quick warning to others to figure out a better plan than me for when you are trying to exit!!! ** I have different numbers with them on different deals as we have 5 kids!!",0
"I put in an order on 9 Oct. Appointment with engineer booked for 28 Oct. Fine. Stayed home 1pm-6pm, engineer said he couldn't do everything on the day. Another visit from two more engineers two days later. Stayed at home, yet again, 1pm-6pm because who cares about job and life and etc., right? They installed everything and completed the job. Today, still no internet after endless (well, not endless, only ca. 50 mins each) chats and calls since yesterday. All one gets is a different person every time on the other end of the chat/call saying that they have marked it as priority and now I have to wait 30 mins... Frustrating. I'd rather someone said: look, we couldn't care less, wait a few days and we will try our best, or almost our best. Would they be alright with it if this was a client's approach to payments, for example? ""Oh, sure, I'd promised to pay my bill once a month but you know what, why don't you wait a few days...""-----Update after Vodafone's reply:I did call them again today. Twice, so far. Twice they said it was now all sorted and I had to wait 30-50 mins top. I still don't have internet.Update 03/11/2024Vodafone are absolutely worthless. they were unable to resolve the issues with connection outlined above, so I asked them to cancel the order. initially they refused and quoted their own internal policies as a guide. only when I explained the law allows me to cancel the contract they agreed. this was yesterday. today I woke up to a email from Vodafone with a bill for £26. it is beyond me how they can issues a bill for a service they did not provide. I have now ben connected on the chat for the last 3 hours, I have been transferred 5 times and every persons acknowledged that the service was never delivered by Vodafone but were unable to cancel the bill. I asked for the complaints team contact details and again was refused the information. now I am chatting to 'mamager' who also refuses to give me complaints team details and advises he will raise a complaint (as if I was unable to do it myself) and the team will contact me within 7 to 10 days. this will mean that I will go over the due date for the bill. I explained this to the 'manager' and asked them to flag it as urgent and for someone to call me. all I got was we don't use phone, you contact us back in 72hrs. absolutely disgusting behaviour from Vodafone. explaining customers to take time of their work/life to be contacting them to rectify a mistake they made. I will be contacting the consumer ombudsman tomorrow morning and making an official complaint and submit a request for 'compensation for distress and inconvenience'.",0
Set up wrong address for broadband even though through 3 calls due to delays in set ups I kept confirming my address they never flagged up it was incorrect. Due to the incorrect address couldn't do installation so then had to cancel and set a new order.Their compensation was to refund me if I am billed for the several weeks missed service. I said I couldn't be billed for that time anyway as there error and I had no way to confirm as the precontract doesn't have address on it.The new one the house doesn't have fiber box so I can receive the service I paid for over 4 hours on phone to customer service;Wanted 3 things:1- My contract sent to me so I can access the app - not achieved in 4 hours call and several departments.2 - a date to confirm when engineer will be out to put fiber box - not achieved in 4 hours call and multiple departments3 - someone to trouble shoot the internet to be usable until fiber box installed through phone line - no achievedI've lost hours of wages during these calls and it was always a different departments fault. No accountability,0
"Shame there isn’t a zero star. Appalling customer service. Issues never resolved. They don’t seem to take responsibility for hardware issues. Been on the phone 6 hours in the last month. Repeated steps from 4 different representatives and still no resolution. Communication is atrocious. Quote “If we find a problem we will call you. If all is working we will just leave it”. That would be ok but it has never worked. So every 5 days give them a call to repeat what we’ve already gone through. They have seen it with their own eyes through the video chat but still no resolution. Basic level support reading from a manual in front of them. Be careful who you choose, but I will be leaving due to “not providing a service”",0
"I wanted to ensure my contract ending at the end of the month would be the same as cancelling my contract as I have found elsewhere at 3 times the speed for the same price for broadband... chatted with Ahmed.Completely inappropriate customer service... asking me what my weekend plans are, how I use my broadband, and these side smiley faces (like this :) ) which is simply unprofessional. How old is he? 12?I asked to cancel my contract and he gives a whole lot of sales pitch BS, so I asked again to please just deal with the matter at hand to no avail. Eventually he got the message after I had to be completely direct with him that I am closing my account, end of.Please train your customer services... it is just unnecessary to feel like I'm dealing with a teenager to get something done.",0
"I have been a customer of Voxi for 4 years. This is day 10 of the ongoing, unresolved issues with mine, my flatmates' and neighbours' Mobile Data with Vodafone/Voxi. I actually tried contacting Vodafone last week (don't attempt - they are useless). I've been in touch with Voxi's disappointing customer services on their website via chat, as well as on their complaints number (+44 808 005 7463 - they actually pick up, worth giving a call!) and have been promised to be contacted by a manager today, which did not happen. The Network Status Checker, so often brought up on here and on other sites and conversations, is useless - apparently, according to the checker, my street in Central London, King's Cross area should have a perfect Mobile Data connection. It's such a joke! I'm extremely dissappointed, frustrated and tired of this situation, but will not stop complaining everywhere I can until my issues have been resolved. Also, I keep being asked to do the same useless tasks over and over again: go to your Settings, restart Mobile Data, check APNs... Never helps, but I keep being bothered with the same instructions. Anyway, as I mentioned yesterday: DO NOT get Vodafone, do NOT get Voxi. You will regret.",0
"Vodaphone phoned me twice in the last ten minutes in spite of me being on the TPS (telesales preference service) which means I don’t want cold call telesales.Vodaphone is a horrible company and gave me useless service- I could never get a signal. When I complained and said I wanted to cancel the contract they said I’d have to pay to get out of it. I complained and eventually got some compensation but God knows how many important calls I missed, including from the hospital when I needed to go in emergency",0
The worst of the worst in every single way!!!!!,0
"Vodafone Broadband service absolutely useless. Broadband not working for last 3 days. Vodafone promised ,engineer will attend to fix the issue for last 3 days. I called vodafone customer care every day multiple times, no concrete response. No solution yet, Vodafone customer care is not proactive, customer care team don’t want to escalate, as if there are managers to listen to customers & customer care says managers can’t help to resolve issues. Vodafone customer care is utterly useless, not efficient, service is worst I have ever seen.",0
"I literally can’t think of a worst experience with a broadband team in my life.From the engineer texting me for two days that he would be at my flat so I had cancelled plans and working from home and him never turning up, to him finally showing and then not being able to install the router properly because there wasnt the correct wiring, to explaining this to vodafone and the employee getting angry at me for believing the engineer and wanting to cancel and then telling me I have to wait for the next day to cancel.The router is obviously in my house but was never even installed, never serviced, vodafone was supposed to send me a package with a return label to return the router in but never did - obviously because they just want more money. Before my bill, I contacted them worried as I hadn’t received the label or package and I didn’t want to be charged. They assured me I wouldn’t be and were confused themselves as to why they hadn’t sent the return material.Now I have been charged and Vodafone is trying to say it’s because they have been waiting for the router and they are charging me for it still being at mine - I only received a return label because of the guy I called last week who sent it me, they had never sent it before thatThey are money obsessed. This was such an awful experience and after days waiting around and hours of phone call conversations with awful employees. I would recommend avoiding.",0
"Customer service non existent.You’ve got 02, Three or EE network. Order a phone from Vodaphone at your peril.",0
The support they give is horrendous. All I want to do is connect a Dream Machine Pro to the ONT. I don't want to be locked into a rubbish router that I can't use for my network!! I would just stay away. I don't believe an actual network engineer works at this company.,0
I just bought a mobile WiFi router. Don't ever buy one.I am unable to set it up. The required password information is written with a load of other information in very small font (snoutb2point) in an area the size of a postage stamp (3 x 2cm)The card that this sticker is stuck to is about 6 x 8cm and the back is empty. Vodafone could print the password on the blank side on normal sized font (12pt) which would enable the mobile WiFi to be set up properly.I thought that I entered the password correctly but I haven't. I may have entered the wrong password (there are 2 with no explanation)I unable to retry the password as I can't find out how to do it in windows as there is no internet connection.I am angry because I can't read the passwords due to their very small size and I can't connect to the internet.I can't get a refund either because I have opened and used the router and SIM card.I will now have to take Vodafone to court as I believe that it is their fault as the provided information is printed in a minuscule font.I bought the router from Argos.,0
"Thank you for your response and offer to look into the matter, that is good. You suggest I contact you on X, and other social media. Unfortunately I do not subscribe to any which is why asked that you contact me by email as mentioned in my earlier review. I would respectfully make it clear to prospective customers that you do not have email.",0
"I've been with Vodafone for 26 years but poor service and expensive and unfair practices on their part has made me leave. Attempting to get any advice before I left was appalling. I only had one question, yet I had to answer over 15 questions to even get the opportunity to ask mine. Then they couldn't answer and would not listen to my pleas for help with standard corporate ""computer says no"" responses. When I then left I got multiple calls from their sales team trying to win back my custom. If I contact them I get nothing. If they contact me to make money I get to talk to a human on the phone. The balance is all wrong. I will never return and would never encourage others to join. Truly awful and no attempt by them to hide it.",0
"Both me and my partner are both with Vodafone, have been for many years and have broadband with them too.I recently upgraded my phone, arranged to collect it from the Vodafone store in Crawley. Was passing the store the next day so popped in to see if it was there on the off chance. Guy who served me did the ID check etc but the phone wasn't there. Not a problem, got a text the next day to say it was there. Popped by to collect it. ID check was passed again and collected my new phone.Later that evening I dropped my old device in the dark and although I can see where it's gone I can't get to it. The next day was Saturday and we had to go and pick up a few bits in town and were passing a different Vodafone store so I went in to see if I could get a new sim. New sim was scanned etc, went through the iD check again, with the same bank card etc and it FAILED. The girl who served me said it could be a problem with the system so she tried another computer and it failed AGAIN. She then said I couldn't get a sim card because you  can't try the ID Check again a third time I'd have to leave it 24 hours even though ALL my details matched including my Vodafone log in, card details account number, address etc etc she still couldn't give me a sim because I might be using a cloned card!!She then suggested I call customer service to order a sim and they can send me one, great advice when I don't have a sim card, how exactly was I meant to make a call? My partner had gone off to pick up some other bits in town and we aren't always together. The signal isn't great where we live so making calls can be difficult as you get cut off. The broadband works fine from the landline.She reluctantly called them for me on a shop mobile, and even though I passed all the security checks on the phone she still couldn't give me a sim and I had to wait for one to.be sent.In this time I couldn't set up every day apps like mobile banking etc and most things need text verification now to make them work. I don't have a local branch and can't access my accounts, even logging in via the website needs text verification! My Dad was overseas, so if he needed me and I wasn't within wifi he couldn't call, if I had car accident or any accident I could call. It makes you realize how much we rely on our phones.My new sim has arrived and I'm still waiting for it to get activated. Tried to activate it online but you have to.log in on the Vodafone website and you need text verification!! Made contact finally via Tobi after going round in circles I have now now been without a network for a week which might not sound like much but it's the inconvenience of not being able to make contact with anyone until I reach Wifi. I feel completely let down by Vodafone, and if I hadn't just upgraded my phone I'd be switching networks. I would ring them to complain but I can't!!",0
"Had to call a mate in Australia this morning (he'd messaged me to tell me that his young son had died suddently) and after a 35 minute call Vodafone presented me with a bill for £108 and locked my phone informing me that I had to pay the out of plan charges immediatelyCalled 191, got put on some silent hold thing. Called back, had no option but to pay £108 over the phone in order to be able to continue to use my phone.My experience -07:19 - Call to Australia started07:53 - Call ended (34 minutes)08:03 - Text message from Vodafone alerting me that I had spent over £1 on international calls08:05 - Text message from Vodafone alerting me that I had spent over £50 on international calls08:31 - Message from Vodafone alerting me that my monthly spend is unusually high08:32 - Message from Vodafone informing me that they have turned off my calls and dataText from Vodafone and that I need to call Vodafone08:40 - accessed account online and tried to resolve with the useless chatbot08:55 - called 191 and was informed I had to pay £108 out of plan charges immediately to be able to use my phoneI have been a vodafone customer for over 20 years across three continents, I do not wish to continue doing business with a company which functions in this way. Sadly my contact has 12 months to run.Very unhappy with Vodafone!!Edited at 13.38 in response to Vodafone reply.Dear Vodafone responder (AI??)If you'd checked your records you would have found that I had paid the off plan charges (£108 for a 35minutes call) before I wrote the main review. I had to, I needed to use my phone.Actions speak volumes and words are cheap. Your response has only made me more determined to end all dealings with Vodafone as soon as my current contract expires.",0
"I placed my order for broadband but somehow it never arrived and on the day of installation, nobody came and when I asked customer service, they said my order was cancelled.After more discussions with customer service, they offered to help me sign up to another new plan, but would be more expensive than the one I originally had. Also could not get an earlier installation date after they missed my original date. Additionally, refused to provide any temporary solutions e.g. a mobile broadband to bridge the gap.Overall, extremely terrible for 1. Not honouring the order and not offering any explanations, 2. Not even trying to do anything to make up for it, 3. Leaving potential customers in a very inconvenient position",0
Was a customer with Vodafone for a number of years and just couldn't get out of my contract took a contract out with them and it was for £40 per month but when I got my first bill it was for £45 and it was in 2 parts 1 for phone and 1 for usage when I asked about this they said that this was the contract I'd taken out which wasn't and it stayed like this for a few months and they kepted messing up on taking payment for my phone and not line rental so I had to make a few months payment to catch up and a few months later I was paying over £50 a month and when questioned them about this they said it was to do with every April that it would rise I tried to cancel saying that they changed the contract that I took out but just got threatened with a huge bill so I was stuck paying this till the end of my contract which as now finally ended thank God but I'm still left paying for the phone which is around £250 for I iphone 13 which I pay £22 a month for which is totally useless as is a broken but at least I'm not in a contract with them no more so that's the end of the nightmare with them well hopefully 😀,0
"I'm Very disappointed with the broadband connection. I'm with Vodafone from June I was quite excited to jump from slow BT broadband in to super fast full fibre Vodafone...that's how was advertised everywhere. Unfortunately that was a mistake my BT broadband was slow but very stable with very low latency great for online gaming which I can't say about Vodafone broadband high latency and unstable connection. I've contacted the customer service to find out what is causing high latency on my broadband and after a few tests and checks there's no solution to this. After digging deeper I've done a few tests and trace route my connection and it looks like my connection is being routed through Vodafone's Scottish servers in Glasgow or Edinburgh. So my connection goes almost the length of the country across vodafone's network, before it even meets the internet. I live near London. And there's no solution for this...If you are looking for a smooth and low latency connection for online gaming definitely avoid Vodafone it's not a great option!",0
"I took out my Vodafone contract and it started out positive, the reception was decent in most places and I enjoy the chances to win stuff on the rewards. I had to go to Germany for work for 5 months and once in Germany I found out that my current contract was useless abroad so I took the hit and added the abroad features so I could still use my internet etc. the abroad charges are disgusting by the way. A month or 2 into my contract with the extra expense of abroad features I receive a text saying that I will no longer be covered as you are only allowed to use your phone for a few months out of England.so I’m now stuck with the added expense of the roaming but wasn’t able to use my phone. I make sure to tell everyone how bad Vodafone is and can’t wait to leave them and never return.",0
"Vodafone are fraudulent without doubt. After noticing my credit rating had gone down in points I checked why my online banking showed Vodafone as missed payments monthly from October 2024 going all the way back to 2018 with missed payment on each month. I have not had a Vodafone contract of any kind for years after opening one in 2009. Vodafone were ok but then it became a constant battle to prove they had make fraudulent amounts owing to renewal agreements that were not kept to. They then said I didn’t have the agreement I claimed. I had four phones one for me and one each for 3 children who I paid for but when they upgraded they had to pay any extra costs themselves as soon as they began part time work while at college. It was nothing but constantly challenging them over bills that were incorrect to changing upgrade agreements. Having to be on the phone hours and multiple visits to the store. I never thought to look deeply as to check for contracts I wouldn’t even have. I have had a few problems credit rating wise but to find out Vodafone had been behind it all theses years is diabolical! To speak to someone you need your account number to just pass the automated system alone. I had multiple tries at making up account numbers and phone numbers till eventually getting through after several days. Then obviously you can’t pass security! Nothing was showing because there was nothing to show . I wanted to speak to someone as they have always been sly and crafty I didn’t want to give them any opportunity to deny it all or changing anything on my old account like they did multiple times back then. Eventually I managed with the help of Muhammad who I will say was very helpful in trying so I could pass security.  Muhammad couldn’t find anything under my name and when on hold a i looked at my online banking credit check and it had been changed  TO PAID UNKNOWN  for October and September this this year how crafty again of them. I pointed this out but got no response. Then after being on hold again Muhammad informed me Vodafone had not affected my credit rating! OMG exactly why I wanted to speak to Vodafone and not giving them the opportunity to change anything to be able to deny it. Again I said that it wasn’t true Vodafone changing the last two months was sly and I had already taken screenshots and have proof of what was done telling Muhammad they wasn’t getting away it. He had first informed me they will correct it and be compensated for what they done that changed to a complete denial not accusing Muhammad of doing it but whoever he speaking did. Do not trust Vodafone this is typical of there conduct and sly crafty ways.Avoid like the plague unless you want high blood pressure, want to spend hours monthly on the phone getting fobbed of with rude people who don’t have to face you personally , want to battle proving they have taken money you don’t owe and I want a very stressful life involved in everything to do mobile phones.  Vodafone have no shame!!!!!  Ignore any reply from Vodafone about this it will be nothing but lies and there usual sorry you had this experience bla bla I will update after I have taken legal advice and it’s concluded.",0
"I have now been a Vodafone broadband customer for just over 2 weeks. In that time my broadband has been dropping out regularly. This never happened with my previous supplier. I have been in touch with their technical support team throughout and, although everyone I have spoken with has been friendly and has appeared helpful, the problem remains. I have spent hours on the phone and have also waited at home for promised call backs that didn’t happen. The matter is ongoing, but I have already made the decision to switch to a different supplier; in the hope of receiving a better standard of service.UPDATE - Vodafone have now admitted they cannot identify or resolve the problem with my broadband. Apparently sending out an engineer to take a look is not an option. So another week with unreliable broadband, that I have already paid for, before my switch. My case has now apparently been passed to the ‘resolutions’ team. Although I was promised an email confirming this, and including my case reference, that has not arrived !",0
"I have a problem with my home landline, which is part of a broadband package from Vodafone.  I was told an engineer needed to visit to fix the problem. I received emails and texts confirming the visit and also a warning that i would be charged if i was not at home to receive the engineer.The engineer failed to show, so i called Vodafone Customer Services.  They struggled to explain what had gone wrong, offered a very casual ""these things happen"" and declined to offer any compensation despite my having wasted an entire morning.  And the problem is still not fixed........",0

"Beware... This company sold me a contract for 2 years for a phone they told me they were the best coverage for the area I lived in.. Sadly it transpired my property had no coverage with this company, After returning the phone three times. Vodafone informed me I was ""in a contract for 2 years and that was the end of it"". I had no land line this was my only way of communicating with anyone . I spent 11 months knowing I could not call for any emergency service. I moved property . I am not a young person. I had to walk a busy duel track 3 miles for a signal.I came out of contract in September only to experience even more problems . They refused a Pac code  and lied once again.  I waited a further 4 days and a  a very rude exchange on the phone to end the contract, I wasn't even in.. Finally they are gone. No I cant recommend the company, or the service, and sadly no real people work at Vodafone. It is AI only...",0
"Avoid this company they overcharge you, threaten to impact your credit score and threaten to charge you a payment fee for services I don’t even have.I cancelled my broadband and gave 30 days notice as per my contract.

Chat staff disconnect you, transfer you and threaten you.Avoid this company and I shall take this ludicrous company further.Regards your reply which is just a generic reply to all complaints:I do not have either Facebook,X or instagram account. If Vodafone had told me this was the only way to resolve and issue u wouldn’t have joined them I the first place. What happened to a customer service phone number? Oh that’s right it comes down to cost saving from Vodafone. You are a joke of a company",0
I posted a review here earlier but it seems that no person was able respond and the troubles remain outstanding. The trouble is that Vodafone fails to offer email contact address to resolve problems. Thus once it had your bank details it ignores what you say and just latches on to milk your account.,0

"Terrible, painstaking experience trying to leave Vodafone, everything takes ages, customer services not listening to anything I’m saying or asking for, make it as complicated as possible to leave. An absolute joke I’ll never return or recommend.",0
"Unfortunately, the signal dropped regularly. I do not live in a rural location. When I found a better provider (after finishing my contract), I tried to cancel and it was such a hassle! I'm now paying for 2 months without actually needing to use their horrendous service.",0
"Couldn't organise a fibre broadband installation in a domestic household.My old broadband contract ran out in August, I tried to renew and upgrade to fibre. I spent at least an hour on the phone.No upgrade happened, I then phoned up in september to re-arrange, I did so, and no installer turned up, I cancelled a day of work so lost wages, Over an hour was spent on the phone. I was informed That there was an issue with my phone number and it had to be changed, gave my permission, was told that someone would ring me after this happened - it didn't happen.I then rang up a couple of weeks ago to be informed that someone would ring me - this didn't happen either.This has cost me money in lost wages, money in which I should have been on a fibre broadband contract, and time. All because a broadband company can't get it's core business right.",0
"More than 2 weeks vodafone Egypt not able to fix my issue, I am not receiving sms from outside of Egypt, is anybody care about real customer service over here, no, they just make tries and failed time after time, and every time the CS just say in 24 hours it will be solved, in 48 hours it will be solved, I escalated the issue and it will be solved, and nothing is solved,Egypt CS is useless, totally useless !!",0
"Tried to get away from BT only to be told my address did not exist.  The Vodafone address database is almost ten years out of date so you will spend hours with their digital assistant, who helps you with nothing but continues asking the same questions, over and over again.  All I wanted was to place an order for Broadband.  Simple yes!  No not with Vodafone.  If this is an example for customer service BT not looking so bad.",0
"Following my review regarding poor service and damage by engineers on behalf of Vodafone, their response below the review was to refer me back to the same process as before. Please arrange to fix the damage, Vodafone. Order no. 0001000038950941.",0
if you like spending extortionate price for mobile data that never works then this is the provider for you,0
"My sister and I had a horrible experience with Vodafone and would strongly advise anyone to stay away! I arranged a trade-in with them, and they initially promised to send me a bag for the return and pick it up from my home. That never happened. Instead, they told me to go to a store to drop it off, even though this wasn’t the arrangement. I spent days going back and forth, calling them over and over, each call lasting over an hour, and every person I spoke to was rude and unhelpful. I had to escalate the complaint just to get any acknowledgment, and even then, they only offered a £65 credit—which is a slap in the face for the time and stress they caused. Vodafone wasted my time, caused me immense frustration, and left me feeling like my issues didn’t matter to them. Avoid them at all costs!",0
"AVOID AVOID AVOID!! (Their customer service  number is not free)Update :30/10: Day 7.  internet finally on after an engineer visited. BUT no phone line.Update: 29/10: Day 6. No response from the CEO Max Taylor. Father waited 24 hours. No change. Now VF are sending an engineer to the home tomorrow.Update 28/10: Day 5. No response from the CEO Max Taylor who I emailed last night. 11 am this morning VF called my father and asked the same question they have asked every day. Any change? My father said no and VF said he would passed to another team. Never heard from VF again. So father rang again at 15:30. VF said wait 24 hours.They have left my elderly parents (85 yrs and 87 years) vulnerable with no landline or internet. After a failed activation date on the 23/10.  They have no solid landline access to 999 emergency service's, or the internet for medication or banking. It is now the 27/10 and still no change  VF customer services have not prioritised the problem instead giving my father the run around by daily saying reset your router. Absolute imbeciles!!",0
"Vodafone disconnected my phone for the past 9 days, from Friday last week (18/10/24). Customer service is horrendous as none of them are helpful to reconnect the number so I can move to another provider and get back to work as I'm an agency worker and rely on calls to get work. Don't bother with them, use other providers, anyone but Vodafone.",0
"Absolutely appalling service. Placed an order on 9th October to move from our current supplier to Vodafone. Due to have engineer for installation tomorrow (28th) and no kit has turned up ahead of this, ring Vodafone to chase it up and apparently no log of any order even though confirmation, contracts and installation info all emailed across. Call handlers didn't even try to rectify the situation or offer any resolution, just terminated all of the order. We wanted confirmation that the contract would be void, as the documents currently say tied in for 2 years aswell as having all our bank account details to take payment and instead of offering this in a way of an email the call handler terminated the call!Absolutely poor company,  definitely avoid.",0
Doesn’t even deserve a 1 star. Absolutely dreadful customer service that sends you around in circles and customer service reps in India hanging up the phone on you.,0
"Unfortunately, I have very bad experience with Vodafone lately. I have signed two broadband contracts with the company end of 2023 and earlier 2024. The sales persons told me if I keep my mobile with the company, I will have royalty discount of 3 pounds on each broadband. As the royalty discount has been applied in previous years, I didn't doubt it. However, this has not been applied afterwards. The company argued that this can not be applied to the account and they can not found the voice record. I have already spent a lot of time calling them and things are still not being resolved! I would like to warn everyone, record everything they said yourself!",0
"Terrible service in the aberdeen area, pay for the full fibre 900 and for long periods of time over the last 4 months the speeds have been less than 10% of what I should get, often going below 10mbps, guaranteed speed is 450mbps, customer services go through the usual motions of switching everything off and on again until they eventually blame cityfibre who own the lines, however having done my research it seems that the other providers that use cityfibre lines don't have this issue... go figure, the worst part, can't leave without paying an extortionate termination fee due to temporary fixes meaning the low speeds aren't 30 days concurrent. AVOID AT ALL COSTSEdit to reply to below,Yeah, called your number to cancel, low and behold, through to technical department again, stating they need 48 hours for changes to be seen, as if, just stalling passing customers from pillar to post, so thank you vodafone uk for your irrelevant input",0
Super shitty Wi-Fi so bloody slow 3G works faster than this I can’t even play a full round of dress to impress without Roblox kicking me out for no internet DO NOT GET TRUST ME ITS SUPER SHITTY 🤬 xoxo from playing customer 🥰,0
"Awful Awful Awful. I have just moved to Vodafone broadband as my last provider pushed prices up quite high and for the same speed throughout my house (or so I thought) for a cheaper cost I moved to Vodafone.Got the router and set it up today and was connecting the TV’s throughout the house. Problems in the bedrooms as there was no signal or very little 1-2MbpsI checked everything and no improvement so spoke to Vodafone on their chat. I was told that the issue was the Vodafone router is only good for around 8m or so and after that there is no guarantees. My house is longer so Vodafone said that’s the problem. Their equipment won’t go that far but all providers are the same. Well that’s nonsense as my last provider managed it just the cost had gone up so high. The solution they have for the poor signal is for me to pay much more per month and they will send boosters. So I asked them to confirm that they would have me pay much more to resolve their issue and was told yes. That’s the only solution. I asked where in all the documents or contacts does it say it’s 8-10m maximum for their router’s capabilities and they said it’s not anywhere, just everybody knows this. Well I certainly didn’t know Vodafone that you don’t recommend your WiFi for anyone who needs it in their house if it’s longer than 8-10m.Beware if looking at Vodafone as they don’t tell you this but expect you should know it.Looking for a new provider now and I have threatened legal action if they try and imply any fees or charges as their WiFi isn’t fit for purpose if you have a slightly bigger house.They do try and hassle you when typing by saying after 20-30 seconds “Not trying to rush you but are we still connected” even though they can see you are typing and when you eventually write what you need to say, they disappear for several minutes. Clear hypocrisy. Poor customer service, poor quality of product, poor broadband signals and the main focus is to get you to “upgrade” at a cost to get what your paying for anyway.EDIT: Edit to Vodafone’s reply. Where the router is situated is exactly the same spot as the last router was and we had NO issues. Your CS team said your equipment is only good to give a WiFi signal for about 8m or so but you don’t tell anyone this beforehand but I guess this is a tactic to lure people in with cheaper prices and then sell them the upgrades to get signal throughout their houses.",0
I have been with Vodafone for several years as an OAP and not very IT aware as my charges escalatedWhen I rang them to query my bill I was told they could not reduce the bill.So now managed to reduce by £15 a monthHow can a company abuse a long term customer  like this ?,0

"My elderly mother has had no broadband or landline service for 4 months.  When she calls Vodafone she is forced to pay for a service that doesn't work, is exhausted and cannot get her service to work. This matter is only going to go one way, to court!  Also what terrible age discrimination in my view.",0
"Don't apply for the benefit claimants options if you're already a customer paying normal prices as they will not call you back. Obviously they prefer you to be paying more 🙄. You will probably have better results results if you switch providers, so I'll be doing that next week 👋🏻",0
"Horrendous service and technical support. Making formal complaints, tech team visits, service team phone calls, Countless hours of complaints and chats with my whopping 1-10 mbps speed with terrible stability. No offer of a discounted early termination fee due to the issues i had. However, at this point, i was happy to pay the fee so i don't have to wait on hold any longer to be transferred to different teams to get nowhere. Just don't ever bother with them, they are happy to take your money and put you on a contract but not happy to help throughout the contract. Probably why they are not part of the Ofcom scheme and also probably why they were rated the most complained about company in the second quarter of 2023.",0
"Since they installed fibre(Jul23) I have so many problems with the connection even I have the contact for 910mb or something similar, I tested tonight and went up ti 150/m download/315upload, during the day when I have a call on teams with max 10 colleagues I always get frozen, I am loosing connection multiple times during the day, definitely this is not the right speed, I used to be happier with another company where I had the basic contract. I asked them to send an engineer to check they refused, I am very disappointed can’t wait to close this contract!!!!",0
Just about to join Vodaphone broadband but after reading these reviews will stay well aware of this company - they should be ashamed oftheir poorservice.,0
"Awful, they offered me an upgrade to super fast fibre broadband at no extra charge and stupidly i took the bait- The connection dr0ps out at least 10 times a day, i now  cant work from home or stream apps on my tv due to the awful connection issues. For four months ive called them and they have asked me to do a range of tasks and if anything the issue has got worse- in the midst of cancelling my contract and claiming compensation but they keep delaying by asking me to do tedious tasks  like swap out the Cables and move your router so its in the middle of your room- yawn/!!  dealing with customer services is just as bad as they ask me the same questions every time i call as they don't seem to be able to pull the data from previous calls...exasperated is what i am.",0
"Worst service I have ever experienced. Signed up for Wifi and had to wait 4- 6 weeks for installation. The number of times I had to call to confirm dates for installation, only to have them cancel on the day and then on the second visit say we need to remove a tree from our yard! They even did a pre-instalment visit to check if the property would need any changes before the install - and of course they said NO we didn’t.After 4 weeks with no service and the only offer they had was to try some other provider or wait another 2-3 weeks.Awful, Awful Awful!",0
"I recently had fibre broadband installed and the engineer did a poor job, leaving a hole in the brickwork which will allow rain and insects into the fabric of the building. I called Vodafone and spoke to a lady in Egypt. She put me on hold 5 times whilst she spoke to engineers(no doubt back in the UK). I was then told to fix it myself. I said this was impossible as the damage us at first floor level. She the gave me to register for a claim form, which I did. The form asks for me to get estimates and submit for, I assume compensation. Vodafone do not seem bothered, putting the onus on the customer to sort damage caused by their appointed engineers. Dreadful service and no help whatsoever. It would take the engineer 10 minutes to sort, but instead I end up with the worry and inconvenience.",0

"We've been trying to sort out our broadband with Vodafone for over a month. An engineer came round on the installation day, and said he couldn't install due to an issue connecting our flat to the main wifi hub in the building - they would need to insert extra lines.They sent an engineer a few days later who was meant to resolve this, but he hadn't been informed of the first visit so we just got told the same thing. He said he would escalate our request.Since then, we were told Vodafone and the engineers would be in contact to resolve this. They didn't contact us, so we called Vodafone who gave us a date for when this review would be complete (today). When we checked in, they said they had no update for us, ""our hands are tied"" and we should check back in on the 29th. When my housemate tried to express your frustration, the agent ended the chat.We've been loyal Vodafone customers - my housemate used Vodafone broadband in his previous house for 3 years and has had a phone contract with Vodafone for 10 years. I've had a phone contract with Vodafone for a year.It's pathetic that this is how loyalty is being rewarded - as a customer service rep myself, the one thing you can do when other things are holding up a resolution is ensure you keep providing regular updates, and the lack of this from Vodafone has been shocking. If we get wifi installed and working before the new year I'll be genuinely surprised. Awful, awful experience so far.",0

Stay away from this company for WIFI I don't get wifi in the upstairs of my address been trying to connect to my booster several attempts hours on the phone and the password does not work when putting in the same as my hub- asked for engineer to come out and look into how rubbish the wifi is at the property when it's supposed to be super fast vodaphone won't do this- asked to cancel so I can go else where they also won't do this without charging me so what are my options stop paying you and take you to court for not providing the service.,0
After being with EE for 15 years decided to move to Vodafone for better coverage ... should be a simple transaction you'd think .... no!  The opposite!  Ordered the sim package on the Friday and was told SIM card would be despatched that day and I would receive it Monday. Monday came and no SIM card. Because I kept my old number they had transferred it to them so my service with EE ended which left me with no active phone!  I called and asked where my SIM card was and was told they would send another one which would take another 3 days!  They then said to go into a Vodafone shop!  I explained I worked long shifts at a hospital and shops are closed when I finish work so would have to wait the 3 days!  The original SIM card arrived on Thursday!  Postage mark on envelope showed they hadn't posted it until the Tuesday!!!  So I have been without a phone service for 3 days bearing in mind I need to be contacted from work and I have an elderly parent who needs communication with me. I was told I would get compensation ..... 78 pence!!!!!  Laughable!  Certainly not worth the stress and frustration I went through!  Wished I hadn't of bothered changing providers now!,0
"Was due to move over to Vodafone in beginning of Aug going to full fibre.Turns out my property didn’t already have full fibre as they advised I did when placing order.Not a problem- they got Bt open reach to come out- booked time off work - a sub contractor came but couldn’t do job- he arranged for a proper open reach engineer to attend. (Why they couldn’t of sent someone who could do job in first place was annoying)So they sent someone else round a month & half later as this was next time I could book more time off work,Engineer turned up but only note on his system stated customer had refused work that needed doing!!! - I’m not sure how when I’ve been in contact constantly to get issue resolved. This engineer couldn’t do the work either,He put a duct on and marked up where the work needs doing and said someone would be in contact within 7-10days, - didn’t happen.Throughout this Vodafone customer case managers & now complaints have called but they are a waste of time- all they phone to say is no update we will call you back at later date to see if work has been done!!I had a call of one of these agents other day who just said open reach are still having problems I will call you back on 5th nov.In the meantime that morning I got cut off from my old supplier as Vodafone had got open reach to disconnect the old line- Vodafone didn’t even mention this on call.This means I am going to be without any internet for at least two weeks (I no longer have confidence they will even be able to sort it then as they haven’t arranged access with me.Vodafone’s customer service/complaints department is such a disappointment- I need internet for work, tv, heating etc but they are not bothered at all- just say there is a problem with open reach end- it was Vodafone though who arranged for me to be disconnected from old supplier!!I asked if they could provide me with a WiFi mobile dongle so that at least I could have some internet in the house but was told I could go to a Vodafone shop and see if they might offer me a discount on one!! - they just don’t care, wishing I had never moved to Vodafone now- I would swap companies but worried they have messed up lines/fibre so much now that I will end up in worse situation. So upset & annoyed.",0
"Awful company. Found a great broadband deal and decided to change over to them. I knew it was too good to be true. City Fibre worker turned up and said there isn’t even infrastructure set up in the area, so why we were allowed to order this, we had no idea. We waited two weeks for nothing. Before this, Vodafone advised us that they would inform our previous company to cancel our renewal contract, whilst we were in the cooling off period. Guess what? They didn’t even do that! So we have had to stay with the other company, who have now offered us a better deal. Please do not be tempted by Vodafone’s great prices. Even after speaking to their customer service team, they weren’t even bothered and extremely unhelpful. They said they would call us back with an update, but didn’t. They clearly don’t care. We just keep getting generic emails saying you have cancelled the contract (which didn’t work ven start). Avoid.",0

"I have been using 3 family phone lines and home internet from Vodafone in the UK for the last 4 years. I will be moving to my own house soon. The landlord has made an agreement with a new tenant. The tenant has created his own subscription. I received information from Vodafone that my contracted line will be cut off. Despite giving them feedback twice that I do not want my line to be cut off, my line was cut off. Despite communicating with them for 3 hours last night, they did not provide any solution. They preferred to proceed as if I was a new customer. They stated that my internet could be turned on in 2 weeks at the earliest. I did not understand what kind of customer protection policy they have. Be careful, when someone who feels like it applies for internet for your house, it can be cut off immediately. A big disappointment. They made us suffer a lot just when the schools were closed and I needed it the most during the moving period.  Moreover, the phone lines I use have been receiving terrible signal lately considering the area we are in. It is not befitting of such a big company.  A big disappointment.",0
Internet down again in area .. 2nd time in a week .. theyvsay problem in my area yet neighbours are fine.. avoid vodafone as it was the worst decision ever to go to .. most unstable network ever and I work in IT !,0
"I had previously had a broadband contract with Vodafone and was pleased with their service, so this was disappointing.As my contract was coming to an end, I was looking at moving from BT to Vodafone, who offered a really good deal on full fibre broadband. I used their online chat. Waiting for a live agent, to be connected the right person, and then to get an answer took a very long time. But in the end I was able to double-check with their technical dept that they could use our existing fibre connection, and wouldn't need any more connections, or to dig up the drive, or more cables on the front of the house, etc. They assured me they could use the existing fibre.So, I signed up online. Except the website wouldn't let me past the direct debit stage and I had to phone them. The call took over an hour.The next day I had a call from CityFibre. As our existing connection was installed by Openreach they would have to install another one. What?! Unbelievable. If Vodafone had given me the correct information I wouldn't have wasted so much time signing up.So I called Vodafone to cancel my contract. The call took 40 minutes, including long waits and endless security questions, because they had lost the PIN I had set up the previous evening.I may be paying more, but I'm sticking with BT, who have agreed a reduced price.",0
"Paid my bill on time every month for nearly 4 years. Prices have been put up multiple times and never complained. We've come to cancel as we're moving home and we're being forced to pay a petty ""disconnection"" fee which Vodafone refuse to waive. It's absolutely bonkers that after 4 years, they still charge you this ridiculous petty fee just to cancel the service. What a scam.",0
Absolutely dismal. Using my mum's vodaphone connection in the Whitby area I assume it comes under the Scarborough location. Crashed/disconnected at least 3 times this morning. Definitely would not recommend the service on this showing.It is totally not fit for purpose. Not good enough.,0
"Trying to transfer a number from a Vodafone account in my name to a Voxi account into my daughters name. We spent 2 hours on webchat repeating the same information to different people. We were then told to fill out a change in ownership form that would be done in 24 hours. We received email confirmation and it said we both had to be available at the same time. Myself & my daughter made sure we were together for 2 days to sort this but heard nothing back. Did another webchat today only to be told that there was apparently no record of the request, despite email confirmation. We asked to speak to a manager but were denied and just told to ring a number tomorrow. I work full time and my daughter is a full time uni student so it is difficult for us to both be available at the same time to sort out this issue. The customer service recieved has been awful. Constantly pressured with upgrades despite telling many people previously that we have already purchased a Voxi sim plan. This is deeply disappointing to a customer of over 2 years and I would no longer go back to them after this awful experience.",0

I use android they recommend me get iPhone, my miss using iPhone we both have same issue, in middle of homework it goes to E emergency only no signal bar no Internet. My humble advice if you have Vodafone just rid of it. Unfortunately I have one more year with them otherwise I'll never think of Vodafone in my life again. Just scammer to me.",0
"Vodafone have been sending me emails for someone else for the past 6+ years. If your name is Linda Gibson, account number 310839***, I have your full mobile number, contacts, address, partial banking details, etc. I have contacted Vodafone before but they won't remove my email from their system. They just said 'you shouldn't open bills for someone else'. Not very helpful when you don't know what the email is until you open it! And when I went into the shop they said they'd need another email to change it to! I'm not Linda, I don't know her email! I don't want to have someone else's private information. Thankfully I'm not a scammer. If you're considering Vodafone, think about whether you'd like someone else to have your data!Why does it require a social media account to receive support?",0
I called customer service to see how much roaming was for Tunisia as I am going there for a week. The rude man reeled off lots of prices then said fir New Zealand? I corrected him and he went on to tell me that he was certain I said New Zealand? I advised it was impossible and he laughed. I asked for a manager and he terminated the call. Awful is all I can say. When my contract is up I will be looking for a new provider.,0

"I purchased a contract for Vodafone broadband on 11th September. Vodafone confirmed and scheduled for install the 23rd. Vodafone placed the order with CityFibre to come do the install. When CityFibre turned up they reported they had not installed the infrastructure necessary to connect my home. Despite my next door neighbour having fibre broadband with them, my home and a few others in the lane could not. CityFibre have said it will take until at least mid-November to rectify, and in the meantime cancelled the order with Vodafone. To make matters worse, I'm also a Vodafone/VOXI customer, and the house is a deadzone for coverage. I spoke to Vodafone reps to ask if they could re-activate DSL service, which my previous owner was a Vodafone customer for. Vodafone replied that it's their intent to stop any further DSL installations so they could ""upgrade all customers to fibre"". At this point, it's now a month on. I have no mobile coverage. No broadband. I've tried to contact Vodafone reps through their contact number, but it directs me to answerphone which hangs up on me every time. I contacted Vodafone UK on Twitter, and they directed me to the same phone number. I still have the Vodafone installation package, and I wonder if they're even bothered to come and collect it.When CityFibre do complete the install I will almost certainly contract broadband with another provider. Vodafone are dedicated to acquiring customers, but want nothing to do with actually ""servicing"" customers.",0
"Slow and unhelpful. I live in a rural area and am only guaranteed a minimum of 20mbps. This is fine for what i need. However, for weeks i was restricted to less than 1mbps, this took 6 hours of my time on a live chat trying to get this resolved. end result was an engineer visit and back up to 20mbps. Short lived success though as less than a week later we are back down to ridiculous speeds.I again contacted support who are painfully slow. a 20 message conversation can take two hours. i spent 4 hours on chat yesterday and two more hours today. I cant speak for all of your customers but my time is the most valuable thing to me and find this infuriating. I wouldn't mind so much but i get nowhere!I asked to be put through to cancellations and was threatened with an early termination fee (I refused as it is Vodafone not holding up their end of the contract) surprisingly they became a bit more helpful however were still very difficult to deal with.as it stands i have put 10 hours of my time into live chat and still have slow broadband. My advice would be to pay a little more money and use an ISP with better customer service.Edit to reply to Vodafone: Thanks for your VERY generic reply. i didn't expect anything more... Do you think with the 10 hours i have spent trying to get this resolved that i have not done the troubleshooting guide? Your generic response is more of an insult.Just to add, my very slow broadband (less than 1mbps) dropped out completely now and have had no internet since yesterday at 5pm..",0
Absolute scammers I purchased one of their plans having no idea it was basic plan wasn’t even told and apparently because I’m on a basic plan I can’t pay for premium rate which I need  text that is the most stupidest thing ever it should be standard on any plan not to mention none of the terms of conditions were discussed with me in store so I entered into an agreement which I had no idea I couldn’t do certain things ridiculous ￼,0
"My service was supposed to be activated on the 10th October. As of the time of writing this it's now the 22nd and I still have no service.The first week involved several calls where support asked me to repeatedly prove that I know how to connect my router and repeat the same troubleshooting steps over and over. I mentioned this to one technical who replied 'well you haven't done the steps with me'.Another technician promised that it was all sorted and that all I had to do was reset my router one last time. Of course it didn't work.I was later informed that 3rd line support had rejected the escalation and sent back down to try further troubleshooting.Upon asking for an engineer another technician promised me there was no need for one and that the fault was not with the line.This period was followed by consecutive days of 'it's with an internal team we'll provide an update in 24 hours' over and over again, with no meaningful update ever materialising and instead getting a lot of platitudes.Eventually after speaking to a manager, it was acknowledged that an Openreach engineer was in fact, required and arranged.They are now finally working on it but it should never have taken this long to get to that point. Tomorrow is the final day of my cooling off period and I will likely be cancelling my contract. The only reason I've not done so already is because it would come with a financial penalty in terms of offers etc. However it feels a risk given the level of service I've experienced so far.Update: as you can probably tell from their pretty useless response to this, the issue never was resolved (I continued to get the 24 hours line) and I cancelled just before my 14 day cooling off period began. The killer though, is that when I got sent a 'final bill' a month later charging me for the 2 weeks I never had plus another 2 weeks after I cancelled just for fun.",0
"Another day and another review for vodaphone. Due to the amazing Internet speeds and wonderful customer service I've decided to leave. When I say wonderful I do so sarcastically and actually mean horrendous. There's more speed from my granny on her stair lift than Vodafone internet speed and if you like repeating yourself more than bill Murray living the same day over and over in groundhog day then Vodafone customer service is for you. That wonderful experience aside I've decided to go with plusnet, yes that internet that the Yorkshire bloke sells on the TV. It's so inviting it feels like a warm hug opposed to Vodafone. I'm not sure what's worse the call centre in Delhi in which sparkle sympathizes with my ""pain and discomfort"" of having no Internet or the chat bot. Either way I've already spoken to a person at plusnet for an update and they use words that form a coherent sentence and are not called sunny stardust. To top of Vodafones incompetence they have shut me off two days early. Do yourself a favor and steer clear. I could write a note on a paper aeroplane and launch it aimlessly outside and it would reach the person I'm trying to communicate with before Vodafones download speed musters up enough bytes to send a Whatsapp message. Garbage service and garbage customer service.",0
Everything - particularly the call centre agents who don't appear able to understand basic issues/questions.,0
"I opted for the Vodafone Pro Fiber Full 500 couple of months ago but sadly the internet speed is nowhere close to that. I have installed two super wifi boosters but still no improvement. Even Netflix shows keep buffering in between.I would call their customer care but dont have time to waste hours on the line with no solution, which is what happened last time. Unfortunately we have learnt to live with the slow speed and poor service as Vodafone is least bothered",0

"Worst phone network in the UK!! They’ve charged me after I’ve left them a month ago, even though I’ve cancelled and closed my account and moved to a far better network. They have no clear communication and they have very poor customer service that takes ages to get through. Absolute disgrace of a company!! And will never be recommending their service again. The coverage is awful and hardly get any signal for date in the East Midlands.",0

"After receiving a threatening letter informing me that I owe money for a Vodafone account that I have never opened, I contacted Vodfone and informed that they would deal with the issue and liaise with the police and credit agencies on my behalf... 3 months later I receive another letter informing me that it is now being passed to a Debt Collection Agency and there's nothing they can do.",0
I have spent 4 weeks changing the incorrect name on my account so that I could upgrade the phone. I have been with them for 25 years and have never missed a payment. I have now failed their credit check. Can't make it up.,0
"Vodafone's coverage is good. However, they appear completely incompetent at porting in phone number from another phone company. Whilst I understand things occasionally go wrong, what I find unacceptable is the constant lies I'm being told by the people answering the phones. The Vodafone porting team keep resetting the porting of the number after a failed port, expecting a different outcome from doing the same process over and over again....utter utter incompetence.11/11/2024. I quick update....29 days and Vodafone have still failed to port in my number....they have also left me without any service for four days. If you want to port in your phone number AVOID VODAFONE!",0
"We have been with vodafone for at least a decade for broadband (and my partner for mobile) and always found the broadband service to be solid, but the customer service poor if we needed any help. My partner and I are recently moved house and this has, unsurprisingly, proved to be a bad experience including very poor listening and planning skills, possibly lies, mistakes, poor communication, indifference and a lethargic attitude to fixing customer connectivity problems.  Voda operatives seem to be trained to be obsequiously polite, but *not* to set realistic timescales/expectations, to own issues or pursue quick problem resolution for the customer.I’m keeping the details brief due to the TP letter count limits.Move date minus 6 weeks. Spoke to someone at Voda to confirm when we needed to give notice of move so we didn’t miss any important deadlines.Move date minus 2 weeks. Called to set up move.  Agreed to terminate our exiting line and start new line on the date of the move (25 October).15 Oct. Got notification that the broadband install would be 29 Oct, not 25th as promised.  Rang to complain.  Told that this was the earliest Openreach could attend and there was nothing they could do about it.21 Oct.  Voda cut the broadband at our old house early for no obvious reason.  They said it would take 2 weeks to reinstate so nothing they could do about it.  When we complained, the operator we spoke to just said the people we originally spoke to just don’t listen and/or lie.  They have complained to Head Office about this, but nothing ever happens.22 Oct. Despite being out of contract, we got a “welcome to your new contract message” and had to ring up and get this cancelled.  We did not sign up to be trapped in another 2-year contract at the inflated rate we are paying.29 Oct. Service move day.  No news from Voda or Openreach.  Internet not working.30 Oct. Internet not working.  Called Voda for an update.  Openreach encountered an issue and so couldn’t enable the line.  Promised that the next update would be 1 Nov.1 Nov. Internet still not working.  Again, I had to ring Voda to find out what was going on.  On 30 Oct, Openreach put a note on the job saying this was more complicated than thought and next update would be 6 Nov.  No-one at Voda had looked at this until I called.  There is no ownership by someone to get this service up and running.  After some vocal insistence from me and some condescending responses from the person at Voda, they agreed to escalate this and personally take ownership of the issue.  Why had no-one done this from the start?4 Nov. Called by Voda (what a treat!) and Openreach had cleared the fault.  Was told to wait 48 to 72 hours for back-end provisioning.  I said this was totally unacceptable.  Call handler then raised a ticket for it to be provisioned same day.  So why initially say I should wait 2-3 days is beyond me.5 Nov. Called by Voda.  Internet still not working.  They suggested it was because I was using the wrong password.  The router was factory reset, all defaults in place.  It could not have the wrong password.  The log also shows errors.  They escalated this again.  Told to wait 24 hours.6 Nov. Called by Voda.  Internet still not working.  Told me they have found a fault (maybe they finally checked the logs like I did?!)  A new ticket has been raised for another team.  Told to wait up to 48 hours for this to be fixed.  I said this was unacceptable.  They said they would escalate this, but there was nothing they could do.  The team did call me this afternoon, but there was a security issue (I am second named on the contract and this seems to cause some confusion).  After resolving that with my partner and them finally calling me back they fixed it remotely, which makes you wonder why they couldn't have just done that once Openreach had finished and we had to wait another 2 days for them to believe it wasn't working.  But we got there in the end.Total no. of days without internet at new house: 12.  Total no of days without internet in total: 17.  No. of days Voda might pay automatic compensation so far: 9.  And they probably wonder why I’m frustrated by their p*** poor service.",0
"Any slight change always goes wrong!I have been a customer with Vodafone for 5 Years +, every time I have moved house, changed my plan, updated details etc, something always goes wrong with my order.And in true Vodafone fashion when I move to a different provider even though I received confirmation my contract is cancelled, the process does not work and I have to contact them directly, again!",0
"Was served by an Asian man called Zulfi, recently. I went, because I had a problem with my phone, and I found his customer service skills absolutely atrocious. He was rude disrespectful, and completely disregarded what I went in for. I feel extremely disappointed, especially as a long time Vodafone customer and I hope he is pulled up on this behaviour, because I have no doubt that traits like that, are unfortunately, learnt over time. I’ll be leaving Vodafone once my contract ends, and I really hope his behaviour is addressed and dealt with appropriately.",0
"Utterly fuming with Vodafone broadband this morning. We followed the ridiculous process for giving 30 days notice for moving house, we specified clearly our request for disconnection on the 25th October and woke up this morning (21/10), 4 days early without broadband. Absolutely nothing Vodafone can do as it would take 14 days for a reconnect. Unable to work properly now for the rest of the week. So glad we didn't pick up the new contract they tried to sell us, although even though we declined the new contract they didn't listen and ordered it anyway. Shocking experience end to end. They want to sort their processes and staff out, they're offering an essential service for god's sake.",0
"Never go with Vodafone, My contract is over and due to excessive disconnection and bad service I decided to leave them at the end of the contract but they charged me £45 more even though I informed them earlier and I had paid all of my contract payments. This is officially disrespecting the customer and extorting money.",0
"Tried getting broadband but failed a credit check, my score is in the excellent range never been refused before no reason was given for the refusal.

"I've been a Vodafone customer for a while - I've always found the technology reliable.But - I've recently been charged each month £7-£10 more than my monthly bill should be.As online access to my statement is not currently available, I decided to call the Help number (44555) stated on the email telling me my bill was ready to find out why.I got through very quickly - only to hear a recorded message telling me that in fact the service promoted on the email they sent to me is no longer available and I should try the online FAQs - unsurprisingly these generic answers do not answer my specific question.Slightly exasperated, I looked for detail on how to make a complaint. I saw on the relevant link  that i could phone 191. It being Sunday afternoon I called the number on the website because it said that ""Our phone lines are open Monday to Friday, 8am to 10pm and Saturday to Sunday, 8am to 8pm"".I got through very quickly - only to hear a recorded message telling me that in fact the service promoted is only available Mon - Fri 9.00am - 5.30pm.Im still none the wiser about my monthly charges and disappointed and unimpressed at the apparently cavalier approach Vodafone have to customer service.",0
"I came into store with my elderly mother as there was fraud done on her account (she has never had a Vodafone contract). The staff in store said there was nothing that can be done here so I asked to speak to a manager. I was then spoke to by Hussni, claiming he is in charge and that they sent help with this matter at this store and wrote down a number on sole piece of paper. We went away and called the number which was not valid so I had to go out my way and get help online. The so called ""manager"" Hussni has zero customer service skills and does not know how to support vulnerable customers. I am not a Vodafone customer and will never consider them because the store have no compassion for helping. I walked past the store after and they was all standing there twindling their thumbs. I have made a complaint with the advisor I spoke to on them phone.",0
"Beware of international roaming con. We travelled to Jordan recently, and as always switched off roaming immediately after switching off airplane mode on landing and didn’t use data or phone for the whole trip (we never do and usually get local SIM). Both of us were hit with a £7.39 connection charge even though we didn’t connect and didn’t use our phones. We have travelled extensively this year and this is the only time it has ever happened. Vodafone just said nothing they could do and wouldn’t remove the charge. This is just a con and they know it - and usual waffle to try and say they couldn’t do anything. Avoid as they are just trying to rip people off.We have spoken to you on social - no help basically say can’t do anything and it’s tough.

"I have called this review misery because that is what Vodafone have caused me.  Back in August I entered into a contract with the, for my mobile and internet ready for my move to a new home.  The phone did not arrive as arranged but eventually came a couple of days before the move but without a SIM card. I was left to move house without a working phone and arrived to find I had no Internet access at my new property. I was left for three days with no contact with the outside world and as an older widowed lady this was quite frightening. I had to go into a Vodafone store to resolve the issue with my telephone.Six weeks on and I still do not have Internet at my home address. I moved here so that I could work from home to manage the pain I now have with osteo arthritis. I have spent hours on the phone to Vodafone with no resolution in sight. They blame BT. I have tried contacting BT directly because I’m not their customer. They won’t help me.Vodafone latest act to add to my misery was to send me a device which was meant to give me more data to run items in my home. However, when it was delivered a code was demanded from me and I gave the only code that I have with Vodafone was told this was wrong, and they refused to give me the device. This action reduced me to tears as I truly have had enough of being treated so horribly.Please don’t use this company. They will make your life a misery. They have mine.Please don’t send me your usual contact us on social media as it is simply disingenuous and anyway I do not have any social media accounts and I am not setting one up just for Vodafone .  I just want out.Update.  Just cancelled the contract.  Seems the only sane option.",0
"No spending on infrastructure shows how crap this mob is...it's now as bad as 3 network...disgusting.. I had to write this therthered to my EE phone because it wasn't possible to do from my unlimited high speed 5g vodafone connected mobile... choose ee or o2 if you want your mobile to work in peak times, which everyone needs... that's why they call it peak!",0
"When someone from a broadband provider says she will call me at a certain time, why oh why do I continue to kid myself that this time will be different…that this time, the adviser will actually call me. I wouldn’t for one nanosecond compare my situation to that of Job, since his was of a much more serious nature, however, I can say that I am undoubtedly one of the most patient, most understanding people you could ever meet. Nonetheless, even my patience has been strung taut by recent experiences.The main reason I switched from TalkTalk to Vodafone was because of the former’s atrocious customer service.Almost 5 weeks into my new contract with Vodafone, I realise that I might as well have stayed where I was. Multiple phone calls and an online chat to resolve what I believe should have been a simple issue, broken promises, and the latest episode where I’ve been waiting for a call today which I’m fairly sure won’t now come.It IS over 3 hours late after all.So, so disappointing AGAIN, but really not very surprising.Of course, something catastrophic may have happened which meant that my call couldn’t take place, but there I go again, still trying to give the benefit of the doubt.If I could score zero I would, but I can’t, so I guess it’ll be 1 star which to be honest, isn’t really deserved.Please, Vodafone, DO NOT ask me to reach out.Just do what you were supposed to do without me having to spend even more of my time on seemingly futile phone calls.",0
Service didn’t work from day 1. I spoke to countless advisors who all either passed me on to someone else or said they couldn’t help. I’ve never dealt with a worst company in honesty. Repeating every conversation with someone new who also couldn’t help. Please avoid at all costs!,0
Staff was disrespectful and rudeI never seen this sort of behaviour customer service.,0
"Very disappointed by Vodafone today. Basically I’ve been paying for my ex’s phone bill all this time and now I had to cancel of course I tried to contact Vodafone through the chat a lot of times, by calling them too. All I got was a response that they would put me through to another team and they’ll resolve the issue on the chat. Then lastly they said they can’t resolve the issue of cancelling the direct debit from coming out of my account as it not on the account even though I was paying for it. His name was on it. I’ve contacted my bank and cancelled the direct debit but been told to tell Vodafone due to them maybe taking out any more payments hopefully it won’t come to that but could do. Vodafone didn’t help at all. They should though",0
If there was option to give 0 star service then I would have rated as 0.Dont go for their so called full fibre service as it will not be activated ever and you will be drained out by dealing with their pathetic support team. And the chat service provided on other review also doesn't seem to work. I booked my broadband on 8th October and I was told that the service will be activated by 23rd October however on 20th October they communicated that due to challenges with City Fibre we dont have a definite date for the activation.I have to travel to London 3 days a week as i dont have a working internet. Please dont choose Vodafone,0
Vodafone have sent out emails to customers who are out of contract saying they’re being moved to new plans with “no commitment”.  Absolute rubbish!  It took three phone calls and probably an hour of my time to establish that people are actually being moved to new 24 month contracts.  If you’ve had one of these email you need to act swiftly if you want leave or pay a termination fee.UPDATEI reached out as suggested and got a response offering to cancel my contract - feeling really valued now!,0
"The Home Broadband team are a total joke. Originally I was with PlusNet and had an Openreach engineer booked 4th Oct. On the 4th Openreach couldn't be bothered to come in the afternoon as agreed, and arrived at 9am which I couldn't do. I cancelled PlusNet and went with Vodafone and waiting until 18th for an Openreach engineer which was booked 8am - 1pm. This time they didn't arrive at all.Openreach won't speak to me they say speak to my provider.Vodafone advise online chat, however that keeps timing me out as I only have 1 bar of Vodafone mobile reception and keep loosing connection.I spoke to Vodafone over the phone, they said until the engineer filed his report they won't help me. The fact the engineer hasn't been and there is no report doesn't seem to be something they want to accept.A day later Vodafone called to say the reason the two visits failed is because the engineer can't get hold of me by phone on the day of the visits, but as I don't have WiFi calling until the engineer visits we find ourselves in a catch 22 situation. How can Openreach expect me to both have a working connection to telephone me when the purpose of them coming is to fix me connection.Vodafone also tried to tell me that Openreach, the UKs largest telephone comms company doesn't actually have any phones that support incoming calls so neither they nor me can speak to Openreach.   This is like Pizza Hut trying to tell you they don't have Pizzas!I am now set up successfully with Sky Broadband. Unlike Vodafone, they had staff who were willing to have a conversation with Openreach and the engineer visited without issue.",0

"Leaving after nearly 20 years with Vodafone.Recently had an issue with Hilton Hotel customer service leaving me on hold for 45 mins. Turns out the call was in USA. The one call came to £120 for that one overseas call. Ironically the call to Hilton was for a refund of £40 :) however, after finding out Vodafone can bolt on for £6 to cover this and 100 mins of international calls, I called to explain and ask for help. But! it was too late now to add the £6 package and they couldn't help me. There was no warning about call charges during the call whatsoever.I have autism and ADHD and I am flagged on the system with Vodafone as a vulnerable person eligible for additional support. Yet no sympathy for this situation, just a massive bill.So I called to cancel my number today only to find out they want another £76 to disconnect my number.Poor show Vodafone,",0
"In 2015 I tried using their services. After a while my online account stopped working. I rang 8 times and chatted online 7 times, for over 7 hours of my time. I was promised several things on the phone (1 month free, 3 months free) which were not in the notes and so never happened. In the end I agreed to pay an early cancellation fee. That didn't happen. Rang again, they found out they should have cancelled last month and then did so, without an early cancellation fee. Then they billed me, but didn't send me a bill. Then referred the account to a credit agency for non payment who emailed me. I then had to call about this bill that should not have been sent, and also chase to make sure my credit was not affected. And no word of any compensation for the amount of time I spent and stress it incurred. I will never use Vodafone again and urge everyone to avoid them.",0

Absolute rubbish company to deal with. I was supposed to be connected Wednesday evening and still no Internet or phone line on Friday.

"Paid a device plan off early for a smart watch I have.  Vodafone incorrectly put my account in collections (ie bad debt). This only became apparent when I went to renew a data sim for my tablet.  My tablet & data sim contract was £87 p/m.  I could not renew my data sim as my account was incorrectly in collections.  I have spent approximately 30 hours talking to various departments in the last 6 weeks, with nobody it would seem able to remove the collection notice from my account.  I cancelled my direct debit for other vodafone plans I have and as a result have finally managed to get the collection notice removed from the device plan I paid off early.  I have approached vodafone for satisfactory compensation. There answer, we'll credit your account with £80 and £28.65, so a total of £108.65.  I have been wrongly charged 3 x £87 (for tablet and data sim), when I should/could have renewed by data sim to about £20 p/m and 2 x late payment fees of £5.  So I have been over charged around £261 and they have offered compensation of £128.65, leaving me overpaying £138.35 for their error, this does not even factor in the stress it has caused and the time I've had to take off work (33 hours and I'm self employed) dealing with vodafones complete mess! Vodafone, I have been a loyal customer for many, many years and you have made a right royal mess of this, your customer service has been an utter disgrave and nothing short of appalling.",0
Over months ago I sign contracts with Vodafone for IPhone 16 pro ! Vodafone provided faulty device and took my IPhone 13Pro for trade in ! And till today  18/20/2024 I haven’t received any replacement device or my old iPhone 13 Pro ! And communication very bad ! Avoid this Provider!,0
"I've been using, or trying to, use Vodafone mobile data for almost a year now and I have to say it's pretty pathetic.I'm sitting in a park very near to Huddersfield town centre and whilst I have a good strong signal my speed is between 0.1 and 0.2mbps.A joke really and this is not unusual...",0
I have been a vodafone customer for a number of years but my patience has come to an end as I am tired of the very poor broadband service and the promises of improvement while my internet continues to drop out and becomes slow regularly (16mbps right now and it should be closer to 50mbps) I will be changing internet provider as soon as possible,0
Vodafone have still not supplied the phone I've paid for after one month waiting.The store manager did not inform me of any delay.Vodafone have lied to me repeatedly.The will not or can not supply the phone I've paid for.Is this fraud?What a massive mistake going to Vodafone,0
"The bandwidth of the connection is as promised.The only problem with this service is that they route London customer traffic through Manchester Internet Gateways. Through BT I got round trip times of 3ms to 5ms, and through them I get 9ms to 14ms. Not good for online games.I can see that there are many complaints online, but they don't seem to care enough to fix it.Edit:After Vodafone told me to chat them on Facebook""Unfortunately we can only perform basic tests on Broadband here in the Social Media Department, Andrew, so I'd have to point you to contacting our dedicated Broadband Team a call on 0333 304 0191 or drop them a message via LiveChat here 👉  so that they can assist you further with looking into routing and more advanced troubleshooting 😊 Ollie""Not much help",0
"Worst ever mobile internet in Cambridge area!!! They are the worst in city Cambridge, no mobile data !!! Omg year 2024 they can’t provide internet city of Cambridge!! I’m more than 15 years Vodafone customer but enough is enough!! Never ever again !!",0
The reception is so bad that talking on the phone is like it’s the 80’s and internet connection is useless in most areas! I seriously regret changing my provider!And when I ‘voiced my concerns’ because the phones were ‘not fit for purpose’ they refused to end the contract!,0
"Extremely Disappointing Experience – Avoid This CompanyI had a terrible experience with this company. They incorrectly placed defaults on my credit file, even though my account was in credit. Although CEDR partially agreed with me, Vodafone failed to properly document key information, which contributed to the issue. Despite this, they have refused to fully correct their mistake. Their customer service has been unhelpful, repeatedly fobbing me off instead of providing a solution.The stress they’ve caused me is overwhelming, and I would never recommend their services to anyone. If you’re looking for a reliable and honest company, I strongly advise looking elsewhere. Save yourself the hassle and avoid these crooks at all costs!",0
"Where do I even begin.I have been with Vodafone for 2 years - never had a problem, about 4 weeks ago they had an outage ... Which coincidentally fell in line with when my contract has just renewed and they were sending me upgrade my broadband packages.I contacted Vodafone to inform them of the broadband speed dropping from 74mbps to 50mbps which was starting to interfere with our streaming services so we couldn't watch anything on TV. My partner then hotspot to the TV so we had some use of TV to which he lost all his data. It says it all that hotspot 5G data worked better than a WiFi service you pay for.I have been in discussion with Vodafone for 4 weeks, speaking to 8-10 different customer service agents to which I had some rude agents, one in particular who on a recorded call said 'so what do you want me to do?' all because the line they have was showing everything is fine.I asked for an engineer visit to which they said 'this can not be gone'. I have cancelled my contract to which they insisted I needed to pay £190+ as an early termination fee despite no service for 4 weeks!I could keep going and going to explain my experience but in short the service has been awful, our speeds have now dropped to 6mbps download speed to which we have no use of our internet at all - we are due to move away from Vodafone in the next week to another provider and I cannot wait to see the back on this business.",0
Very bad experience with Vodafone net work and the team especially whoever I talk today the complaint team she didn’t even care just talking about the contract not even concern my issues. We are paying the money so I’m entitled to get a good net work right ? Just keep on wasting my time and still the issue dragging very bad service and net work,0
"Absolutely horrendous service, I would give a zero if I could. I embarked on a month of terrible Internet connection and download speeds. Vodaphone choke the service, they give you the run around and come up with the genius switch it off and back on again answer Everytime. You can tell the level of training that went into that conclusion. Honestly the worst Internet provider hands down and the worst customer service. I've been in McDonald's at midnight that provided a better customer experience. They are unhelpful and come to the conclusion that you are receiving the speed you pay for forgetting the fact that what speed is going to the router from there end isn't the case from the router to the device. Dial up was better than this service. Honestly avoid at all costs it's quite simply garbage and you will end up going elsewhere.",0
"This review will be posted daily, until such time Vodafone have provided a, 'Positive response' and addressed the issue that i have raised with them. (The 'Bog Standard Reply') does nothing to enlighten me with their service!!! I have reported this item, through Vodafone, and their response below shows that they have not bothered to investigated further to confirm!Bring on the, 'Professional personnel' within Vodafone, who can resolve this issue? And provide me with compensation, for the service that i am not receiving, (which i am paying for from 14th September 2024).Vodafone have an ongoing issue with their, 'Ultra Hub' within my Post Code area! Which results in the connection dropping out, multiple times a day, every day, every week! I have been informed by their, 'Tech Team' that this issue has been present since  the 14th September 2024. I have also been informed that this, 'issue' has been caused by the FAILURE of the Manufacture of this, 'Ultra Hub' in not carrying out a, 'Software upgrade' to rectify this known fault! Vodafone do not appear to know as to, 'When' this will be carried out???? Vodafone, 'Please pull your finger out' and give your Supplier a, 'Kick up the - -  - -' to get this done now!! As a Customer i expect to pay for a, 'First Rate service'? I do not expect to pay for a, 'Third Rate Service' which i am currently getting!!! (Answers now please), Thank you.",0
Worst Broadband I've ever had from any provider for both speed and reliability and dreadful service when trying to sort it.I would avoid them at all costs!Tried all the contacting them things that Vodafone suggest as a reply which is when I received the dreadful service.,0
They made me wait 2 weeks for broadband to be installed. Told me the engineer was installing my BB but never shown up. Now I'm told I have to wait another 9 days without BB and when trying to find out what happened I have been transferred to 6 different departments and nobody will help.They don't care about service/customers just try and move you about rather than fixing issues.Appalling service cancelling straight away!,0
Joined. Told I'd get min 68mbs . Got for the first week. Dropped to 2mbs customer services are a joke. Told I'd have a get out fee. On account stated £76. Actual fee £191 + 26 Total £217. I would advise anyone thinking of joining Vodafone to think again. And another issue. If you want to speak to anyone. Be prepared to take a couple hours out your day.,0
"Having to write this review is my last option I brought a Vodafone 4Gmobile hotspot device to use in my flat monthly payment of 20 pounds for two years. After two month the device stopped working, I went back to the shop Leicester LE14FGi spoke to an adviser Aneesh basically told me that he couldn’t do anything I explained this was the only source of internet I had and I needed it for work. Due to my role, I am not allowed to work in public places so that was not a option. He than offered to change the sim which I said yes to when he opened the device he was that the battery was damaged he than called him supervisor over Hussni who said they couldn’t do anything and I should phone 191 customer service. I came home and did this I was told that the store should have booked the repair in and offered a solution I was than put on hold to speak with the repair team for over a hour than got cut off. I phoned back the next day again I was advised that would get a call back from the repair team which never happened that I called back again the evening spoke to an advisor who told me to go back to the store an they should give me a temporary device. which I did I was serviced by the same person Avneesh I told him that I was told by the customer advisor that you should have booked the device in for repair however you just told me to ring customer service he then called his supervisor over who started to verifier his story two people against one I just told them to stop arguing with me and help he with my issue. While I was in the store, I had to ring customer service team.Who told me that after speaking to his manager they could not do anything and that I would have to wait 6 to 10 days. I just couldn’t believe it I told my work colleagues and friends who again couldn’t believe it such poor service",0

"Had my phone stolen, called Vodafone to put a block on my number - which was told had been placed.Few hours later I discovered my number was still active - called Vodafone and they said ""this happens once in a blue moon"" and the block hadn't been properly put onto my number - allowing the person who stole my phone access to security codes being sent to that number.Now trying to reactivate my number on a new phone - been calling up for four days in a row - and keep being told it will be resolved in 24 hours. No one can adequately explain to me the cause of the delay; I've been into Vodafone store twice and they won't help - just been told to call the awful customer service number.Meanwhile I can't change passwords/security for numerous accounts, because I don't have access to my number, and the hacker could be adding to the already £1,000's worth of fraud they've made in my name.From my dozen or so phone calls with Vodafone - I do not feel anyone understands/cares.",0
"Had three weeks to set everything up, still nothing works, I have to wait till midnight, apparently for the service to go live.The agent didn't find any of the records from the previous conversation (few hours ago), so the team are either lying about keeping those records or him not being able to find them.",0
"I traded in a phone, sending it back via DPD in the packaging Vodafone sent me. I then received a text telling me that as the phone had not arrived my contract was void. Tracking shows that Vodafone received my phone. They say they cannot find it so it’s my problem; I have to contact DPD. But DPD have no responsibility; they delivered it. Vodafone can’t find my phone which they have somewhere and are simply walking away. Can one give this sort of service even 1 star*? I would not recommend Vodafone to anybody.",0
trying to get info on one off price to upgrade my google pixel 4    to an i phone with operating instructions   at a one off price  they want me to pay one pound for this info  I would assume that entails giving my bank account details   I think not  scammers operate within legit companies   too   as I  am a customer why can they not just assist,0
"Been with them for 16 years, went to upgrade my Internet and have been left without for 28 days, lied to about a router being delievred and had appointments cancelled and never informed me. Avoid like the plague, been with o2 for 2 months now and the difference in service is profound",0
Signed up for broadband but never received the equipment. When I contacted them I was told that it was cancelled as they had an issue with my landline porting over and called me up but I refused to give them my security details as I wasn't sure it was the real vodafone. They never sent me an email explaining this and just left me for nearly 2 weeks unaware. I won't be using them if that's the way they treat potential customers.,0

"Managed to get a great deal on an iPhone 16 pro Max via Uswitch. Already a customer on £17 sim only, none of the existing customer offers came close to the price.Phoned up to cancel the old contract only to have a rude person on the phone telling me I should have contacted Vodafone to get a deal. Utter nonsense as upgrade deals online were for THREE year contracts. So would have cost me £2548 over 3 years, compared with my new Vodafone contract which is £1515 over 2 years.",0
"Router not working, smells of burningTried ordering a new plug more than a week ago and got nowhere, purchased 2 plugs twee if that’s the issue as Vodafone wouldn’t send one, spent time on phone going through all the usual checks as the advisor didn’t believe us, the call kept dropping as no signal in home and no Wi-Fi, vodaphone don’t care, Saturday just gone we managed to speak to someone who after a painful hour on the phone ordered a new router and promised it would arrive Monday : and arrange a refund  for non service. Today is Monday, no router, no compensation given, DPD are delivering however the app says they are delivering to the wrong address, called Vodafone so far been on the phone for one hour, nothing resolved, been made to feel it’s our fault delivery is going to the wrong location.

"New customer to Vodafone broadband - I have signed up 3 times now, each time cancelled by Vodafone for various reasons including 1. voucher did not work due to website failure, advised to start again by customer support (they will cancel for me) . 2. cancelled due to another account already open, apparently the other guy forgot to cancel the first one 3. Neighbour already using the line, advised to speak to neighbour to ask them to stop using my line - I asked what this means, call handler started speaking to me as though I'm an idiot for being confused?? Vodafone had cancelled it anyway, but advised I was welcome to start again once I was able to confirm the line was no longer being used by my neighbour. Um no, I'll see what a competitor can offer, thanks.",0
"I had an office phone with Vodafone contract and once I received a PAC code I went to Vodafone Maidenhead asking for a contract that would allow me to retain the number and for an iPhone I could transfer my data to from my office iPhone 14. The guy in the shop gave me an iPhone 8 and proposed an additional sim card with a different number and 15G absolutely free of charge. When I tried to return my phone Vodafone Maidenhead would not have anything to do with it and directed me to another store where I found out that I was paying good money for the extra sim card.The crew at Vodafone Windsor was very helpful and honest. The guy that served me at Maidenhead store was unhelpful, came across as very dishonest and when I tried to give back the iPhone 8 even rude.",0
Terrible experience I’m with them for the last 12 years.I added an internal bundle and they charged me loads of money afterwards.Spoke today to a representative called Tando.I’m waiting on the phone now to speak to a manager as I’m thinking of leaving all of their products because of the dishonest charges and the attitude of that lady.O2 are more accurate and honest never had issues with them.,0

Overcharged by £223 when moving home with my broadband. I've now had 3 phone calls in 5 weeks and every time I've been apologised to and assured it will be refunded to my account. 10 Days since my last phone call still nothing. Pathetic customer service.,0
"I've been with Vodafone for over 10 years, and while the connection is just average—nothing special—the real issue is their terrible customer service. Anytime you have a problem, you're looking at spending over an hour trying to resolve it, and even then, there's no guarantee it will be sorted in one go.I have four numbers on my business account, and I requested to remove two back in August since they're now used for personal purposes. Yet, they’re still invoicing me for them. When I reached out to ask why, they simply said, “they’re still active.” Seriously? And to top it off, they asked, ""Have you moved them to another provider?"" Why should I have to do that? I just want to stop paying for lines I no longer need. Now, I’m seriously considering switching to another provider.",0
"Network performance is terrible, it has been for a while and it's not getting better.18 months ago I used to be able to hold 4G from where I live in the East Mids all the way down to London.Today, I can only connect via the Edge network, everyone else that lives near me with Vodafone says has the same experience. The staff in our local store are nice but that is not the reason to join a phone network.No communications, no explanation, nothing.  Not acceptable in 2024.I have been a customer for over 11 years, I cannot wait to leave.",0
I would rather not comment it.We’re going backwards…,0
The service is so poor.When I changed my broadband to Vodafone I was promised in the shop that I would receive help to get set up. There is no such help available so consequently we get to change over day and I have no broadband There is just no helpWhere is the engineer that comes to the house and helps the elderly and infirm??,0
"Moved house, ordered Vodafone.Internet poor.Openreach confirmed full fibre lines ok.I have wasted the last weeks of maternity, spending every ""nap"" free time on hour plus calls.All neighbours within 2 minutes walk have perfectly working broadband on multiple devices and good speeds (none with Vodafone).The beginning:Internet worked but only if you were basically under the router and even then it would drop on occasion.Upgraded contract and received a booster.Took 4 days and 5 painful phone conversations to work.About a day later wifi drops 20 plus times an hour on every device tried, including every person that visited - did trials on over 15 devices over a week, new and old.Still dropping.Did my own research (3 hours worth) as fed up with technical.Found out it could be 1 of 3 things.Technical acted on one and there was a temporary, albeit painful improvement of manually clicking on another frequency.Technical refused to act on another without a day trial of another fix, which was so bad we were left without Internet.Now we are waiting for a router swap out, for which I have to be in for.So, in summary for all those considering Vodafone, here's your experience if it doesn't work:In 6 weeks:9 hours phone time3 hours own research2 hours doing the resets they said offline20mins to send 1 WhatsApp saying ""happy birthday"" followed by ""are you going out for it"" because it drops that badly.2 stress induced migraines3 times staying in waiting for DPD1 week to go until full time work and the likelihood of losing my job.Yes, I am with the specialist care team, but I am incredibly fed up with having to provide technical with my research. It's full fibre, we are on the same line as neighbours, just different hardware. It's clearly Vodafone.P. S Vodafone, took 30mins to send this due to the drop outs.",0

"Frustrating Experience with Vodafone BroadbandI have been a Vodafone broadband customer for less than a week, and my experience has been extremely disappointing. My internet frequently drops out, leaving me without Wi-Fi or broadband when I need it most.I have called customer support twice to address the issue, but instead of receiving help, I felt like I was being pushed to buy additional products, like a Wi-Fi booster, rather than having my current service fixed. Both representatives I spoke with seemed indifferent to my situation, which is particularly frustrating as I am disabled and vulnerable.Despite my requests for a technician to assess the problem, they refused to send anyone out. It’s incredibly disheartening to feel like my concerns are being dismissed.I hope others can find better support and service elsewhere, as my experience with Vodafone has been far from satisfactory.Vodafone totally refuse to help so now am pushed to seek alternative suppliersVodafone thanks for your reply again you have proofed yourself useless  and of no help again . I told you there is a fault on the line so instead of send 100 links why dont you send an engineer to diagnose",0
"Well, vodafone.Order phone pay upfront charges.Get to the store to pick up the phone after receiving an email to do so.Store doesn't have the phone. Ok, no issues. I'll wait a few days.. but no.. sorry you have to cancel the contract and do it again. Are you having a laugh. That is going to affect my credit score!Two hours later, iv offer to get it sent to me or wait or even go to another store, but they refused to help me at all.That's fine. we have 4 contracts all up for renewal. I guess we won't be using vodafone after their joke of service.Literally, everything we ask for with help right down to seeing if they would check stock in another store they would even do. Wouldn't give me a number for customer service. Literally couldn't care less. Didn't even get an apology. Sorry, it goes a long way! But not to them clearly.Walked down the road to ee. Got phone in 2 mins flat.New life long customers for them.Didn't want to do another search, but since they gave me no choice, I won't be using that search to give them money.",0
"I recently moved house, out of no fault of my own, my landlord needed somewhere to live for a year whilst his house gets done up, so I had no choice. It was extremely stressful trying to find somewhere to live in 2 months notice. Vodafone informed me my new property had no full fibre connection and they’ll need to set that up. I couldn’t leave Vodafone and go with and easier supplier as I would have to pay hundreds of pounds in leaving fees, which I can’t afford. So I decided to stay with Vodafone.Vodafone arranged a technician from open reach to come out, which she was lovely, but wasn’t able to help as there’s no fibre connection. This is something that I thought Vodafone had established already! They give you a 5 hour slot that they would arrive. That’s 5 hours out of work I had to take and nothing was sorted. They arranged for another technician visit which was pushed back 2 months. Vodafone provided me with a 4g dongle in the meantime - of which I’m paying more money for monthly than I would if they just gave me WiFi. I was also told by Vodafone that I wouldn’t be paying any money for this dongle, but they’ve just charged me £50 for it and it doesn’t even work because there is no signal in my area, which I explained to them too.Second technician visit comes around, another 5 hour slot out of work taken for this visit. As soon as he arrives, he tells me he can’t do anything because a survey hasn’t been carried out. I live in too flat of an apartment building which requires scaffolding. All this was discussed in the first technician visit, but the second technician had no idea it was required. He was there a total of 20mins, and I still have nothing sorted and don’t know what’s going on.I’ve explained to Vodafone this is causing me major stress and strain in my job. I don’t want to lose my job over WiFi… I’m paying more money due to their incompetence. It’s thieving and inconsiderate in other peoples stresses and life. I just want WiFi. I’ve done everything to cooperate, putting my job at risk, and they don’t care one bitAvoid this company at all costs. They will take your money, exploit you and take advantage of your cooperation and lack of knowledge on broadband",0
Absolutely awful! I switched broadband providers when I moved as vodaphone said it would take a month to set up. This was no good to me. So I switched. I was told the switch would be handled and vodaphone services would be cancelled! This didn't happen and was billed again. Have since been pushed from pillar to post being told different things. Firstly told the switch would be handled. That didn't happen. Then I was told I had to notify them when I was told when I switched would be handled. Then I was told 30 days and another bill of £33! Already £66 for services I haven't been using. Now they want £120 for the full contract!!! I'm absolutely fuming as obviously I can't afford to pay it. Along with the SIM I was conned into signing up for when I didn't realise the large fees I'd have to pay with my current provider to leave. Absolute nightmare ! Can't even cancel the sim as every time I've tried to cancel services I've been pushed back and forth told different things. Obviously because they didnt want me to cancel and still get money out of me. Avoid if you're trying to switch. Absolute hell!,0

"A truly shocking experience.I took out a broad band business contract, it was sold to me as a 30mb supply, open reach on one of the many visits due to NO broadband at all, tell me that the cabinet was too far from the property to fulfil the contract. I was without broad band for weeks at times. They moved my business plan to my personal account for reasons best know to VF causing later issues. I canceled the contract in oct 2023, in sept 2024 I was contacted by a debt collection agency telling me that I owed 130 quid for supply unto July 2024.I spent (and this is going to sound like an exaggeration) 100 hours plus trying to sort the issues out when the contract was live, with many issues including the fact that VF disconnected my phone and then lost the number, yes LOST the number for a business that was recognised by the number for decades.Back to the personal account being transferred from the business, I am now apparently personally liable for the debt for a contract that I don't have, haven't used, and don't want. more over they won't talk to me because I don't have a contract?????The rude and aggressive South African call centre asked me if I had any needs that have to be taken into consideration, I jokingly said if they didn't sort the issue out during this phone call I would commit suicide. Not PC I know but I was at the end of my tether and the interrogation by the call centre operative was as if I had personally wronged him.

DO NOT GET INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM!!Hours on the phone to people working from home in various countries who are all very polite but have no clue. I’ve been told it’s the microwave, it could be the doorbell, all our doors need to be open, you don’t understand, they need access to my camera to see the router, move the router, move the booster, there’s something wrong with the router, there’s nothing wrong with router. I’ve been told twice that someone will personally sort out the problem and those same people have arranged to call me back and it’s never happened. I’ve missed meetings, waited in for calls to sort it out and been given ‘unique reference codes’ that I’ve copied and pasted and have been ‘incorrect’. I have to jump through ridiculous security hoops every time just to speak to someone even when they transfer a call internally! I go through the same security several times in one call! We are only 6 months in to a 24 month contract and I am tearing my hair out! It used to work fine. I can’t even run a speed test because the Wi-Fi is so poor sometimes! I first raised the issue 5 months ago and have been trying to sort it out ever since! Vodafone broadband is an omnishambles. Customer service is appalling. Just totally unskilled scripted responses. There doesn’t seem to be any log of what you’ve already tried during previous hour long phone calls and they want you to do everything again then say they need more time to sort it out and will need to call you back or disconnect your broadband. This isn’t possible as my husband works from home on the wired connection! He has been into the office several times so they can do this and they haven’t called. It’s never the same person you speak to and they all ask you to give them more time! DO NOT CHOOSE VODAFONE YOU WILL REGRET IT!",0
"On September 1, I applied to connect internet to my home. Until today, it still hasn't been connected. Finally, the vodafone employee I talked to on the phone said that we can cancel the process if you want, we cannot provide you with a solution at the moment, we cannot provide you with an appointment to connect the internet. In this case, I asked for the process to be canceled. They said that you will receive an e-mail within 24 or 48 hours that we canceled the process, but although 4 days have passed, I still have not received an e-mail about the cancellation. I work from home and the internet is very important to me, the situation I am going through because of Vodafone is a really bad experience for me. This 41-day process is really annoying and the lack of a solution is even worse.",0
"Customer for many years,Left Virgin for the pricing moved to Vodafone Broadband to have 2 mobile lines and broadband under one bill over a year ago , I wish I never did. NO DAY GOES VODAFONE BROADBAND DOESNT FAIL,GO DOWN,NO SIGNAL,MODEM HAS NO CONNECTION..Must have called them 10 times ,Instead of Sending an Engineer all you get is an Indian Line Support via Chat facility,They can connect via your mobile phone to help. IT DOESNT WORK...900 Mbps connection is running at 90-100-200 Max ..So I'm exercising my contract option to get out of the contract and go back to Virgin as a new customer..I WONT RECOMMEND VODAFONE BROADBAND UNLESS YOU LIKE SELF TORTURE. As much as Vodafone Mobile is great the BROADBAND is definitely a No No",0
"I have Vodafone SIM card and it’s supposed to work in Turkey and it didn’t. If you’re on the train between the cities or on the road, it easily lose the network",0
Absolutely awful!!! Upgraded to fibre and for 3 days had no internet at all - even when it was sorted the speeds were awful and far worse than I had before. The net keeps dropping out all the time making it very hard for me to work from home and its impossible for the kids to stream a film or play games due to the awful lag. The technical support leaves a lot to be desired and they and not very clued up and think a router reboot over and over again will solve the issue. The woman I first spoke to was very rude and spoke down to me like a child even stating that my microwave could be the cause of bad speeds - never heard anything so ridiculous in my life and she clearly needs some training on customer support and service!! Finally managed to speak to a team leader after stating I wanted to cancel who I admit was helpful but its still not sorted - my advice go elsewhere as worst service I have ever had and cant wait til my contract is up to cancel and go to a more reliable company.,0
"Appalling service trying to get my broadband fixed. The staff have shown themselves to be incompetent and think doing a reset every time they ask will fix the issue. Even worse is that they tried getting me to put different wires into ports which cannot even accommodate them! They have no clue what they are doing.They stated that there was nothing wrong with my line for the first 2 days of dealing with them when they did their tests before eventually doing a u-turn and saying there was a fault. By the time an engineer visits it will be a week without internet after messing me about making claims there was nothing wrong. I have lost count how many times I was asked to turn it off/on again, do a reset, use the test socket etc etc.Avoid them. I will not even been receiving adequate compensation for their appaling service and I cannot wait for this contract to end. This company is vile.UPDATED REVIEWVodafone purposely turned off our internet to play games with us and pretended there was a problem for 2 days. They claimed there was no fault with our line several times and told told us repeatedly to turn our router off/on again and reset it in numerous ways (with or without using the test socket), and more worryingly expected us to put random cables into ports which obviously cannot accommodate them.It was then sent to their so-called HBB Xpert team who, unsurprisingly told us there was no fault with our line and to reset the router AGAIN! After having to call them back to state yet again with have no internet and make it clear I was getting fed up by their appalling service I was then told we had a fault with our line in complete contradiction to what everyone else had said and that an engineer was required which would result in nearly a week without internet by the time the appointment would have come. I called them out for their diabolical service as this was starting to take the mick and made by feelings about them very clear.Five minutes after a very rude phone call towards them the internet started working. No fault on the line after all then? Very convenient that it starts working IMMEDIATELY after that phone call. Unethical business and manipulative behaviour!",0
"Absolute lack of communication and cancellation of my order without any reason means that now I will lose a lot of money having to substitute broadband until another provider can activate it.For context, I'm moving house and on 6th October I placed an online order for Vodafone broadband for my new home. I have received all confirmations, and few days later my bank notified me of a new Direct Debit for Vodafone being set-up.A day before the move (today), I checked on the progress of the order via a tracker, just in case. To my surprise, the order is CANCELLED. When I asked one of the advisers, all they said was that there is no stated reason for this.This means that I wasted a week waiting for an order that will never come, and now the soonest I can get a broadband active in my new home is in 2 weeks time.I work from home and require reliable broadband connection, so now I will have to either spend A LOT of money on daycare and commute to the office every day, or spend also A LOT of money for some mobile router and/or some high data plan, and pray that it will be reliable enough.I will never even attempt to be a Vodafone customer after this experience, if you can't even handle sales properly, which is literally the easiest part of the customer journey.",0
"Worst service incident. I shifted my home, they said they will suspend billing for unless transfer is completed.They charged my for the full period.There were modem/connectivity issues for which I said I want to quit the serviceI then said I would quit the service they again charged termination fees.Call service worst / entirely dishonest people",0
"Upgraded business account because Vodafone have been overcharging us out of contract for months now.  We signed up to a new phone & contract on a weds evening.  Assured phone would arrive next day, which it didn’t.  Over an hour on the phone on Thursday told can’t be delivered to store but will definitely be with us Friday.  Originally had the next day delivery refunded (woo a whole £2!) but after the hours phone call finally had the £5.95 delivery charge refunded.Friday morning no phone so another hours phone call and apparently our postcode (of 50 years) is invalid.  No explanation as to why it’s suddenly invalid but the contract has to be cancelled for us to proceed with a new order like they’re doing us a favour.So 2 days of lost work, no phone, no contract.  And for £20 a month more than EE and O2.I have been phoning on the account holder’s behalf due to them working in (ironically!) an area with bad signal so was told on Friday, having confirmed with the account holder, that I had permissions to sort it all out, only to find that when sorting the upgrade I actually don’t so lots of wasted time for nothing.",0
"Fairly horrendous experience. As follows:1. Promised to sign me up as a business, signed up as personal and could never rectify.2. Canceled and ported package away in June 2024, noticed was still being charged in September 2024.3. No method to contact them verbally as a business, so it's a merry-go-round of Live Chat (which is awful) with promises but no resolution.4. Finally had a call from Vodafone, assuring a full refund would be issued and the contract actually fully canceled; it never happened.5. Joined their support forum to plead with them for help, they said they couldn't do anything.6.

"I would give zero if I could.I was conned into signing up through uSwitch, with the offer of a £120 gift card.  It never arrives and both parties deny all responsibility saying it should come from the other.Following on from that, the worst router coverage we've ever had - ended up purchasing a plug in extender.And the customer service is appalling, useless, obstructive.Avoid, avoid, avoid!Updated 14.10.24Following on from the response received from Vodafone -I find it disappointing that it is necessary to post a negative review in order for a customer service department to finally share the information that a customer requires in order to receive a promised reward.Regardless of where the fault lies for the voucher not being issued, I spoke to Vodafone customer service three times and was only told that it wasn't their problem - when I should have been signposted to Giftcloud two years ago.So I stand by my rating for Vodafone's customer service - absolutely dreadful.I haven't even mentioned the appalling chat bot, that routinely diverts you to the wrong department.  In fact, on the latest occasion that I made contact, I was wrongly directed not only by the bot, but also the first human with whom I chatted, resulting in my having to input security details three times - I was logged in for a full hour before I finally made contact with the right person.Utterly infuriating!Further update - 17.10.24Since being signposted to Giftcloud, I am now going to receive the gift card that was part of my move to Vodafone two years ago.So prospective customers be advised - if you do sign up to Vodafone, don't expect any resolution for your issues through their inept customer service department.Instead you need to come here to Trustpilot and leave a damning 1* review - then it seems you will be treated to the help that you require.Personally, on receipt of the reward that I'm owed, I will then be cancelling my service and going back to Plusnet...",0

"Business Broadband Nightmare...I'll try and keep this short as I could write an essay. My internet hasn't even been installed yet and I'm now wishing I could cancel, here's why:I ordered business broadband based on the decent reviews. Placed an order online and rang to confirm the connection to address is a new line rather than replacement. Was told this was an issue and would need to cancel my order...Spent over an hour on the phone whilst Vodafone amended the order....Following day I received an abrupt broken English phone call to say I had 3 orders in my name - the chap had put the order through 3 times! Vodafone then cancelled all 3 orders without trying to resolve it!!!!Following day... another phone call to say: 1 order was still live and was actually being processed... I said I would only keep the order if they can guarantee the installation date... I was given a date in 2 weeks time!Well that was a big fat lie because....BT popped round to check if I had a phone line...Vodafone then called to say my engineer wasn't coming on the pre-arranged date and it's tough luck and there's nothing they can do about it - Have a nice day!Nobody at Vodafone customer support can offer any help or information whatsoever. They haven't got a clue and are only the middle man as the broadband is supplier BT!It has been such a nightmare and I wish I stuck to BT or Sky.I urge you to do your research and not to believe all the positive reviews!Vodafone... I am sorry but you are USELESS! I just hope the broadband is better than the customer service.",0
"Avoid If you live in/near Chalgrove OX447RW. Signal seems to drop regularly for last year n half. Its often moaned about on our local fb page.I'm moving to O2 in next few days.Greg H.My response to Vodafone reply.Very good, just parrot reply. There are also multiple times each week signal drops for short periods, which we put up with. I guess ur system doesn't alert you to these moments/ issue not been addressed. It's now the norm heavy rain, very windy, power cut (no battery backup! Or if there is, you have another dodgy connection to alert you) signal drops at Chalgrove. In reality service has been going downhill for few years. This last signal down  took you over 6 hours to respond saying problem by email/text! This bicycle alert to yourselves not fit for purpose. On that I rest my case. You have no idea on how bad ur kit at Chalgrove mast is really performing.",0

I’ve been with Vodafone for years never had an issue until recently so I went into my local Vodafone shop in Lincoln.

"I wouldn’t give any star if there is an option.Just joined Vodafone end of August this year. Contacted Vodafone today about myvodafone app login/register as I have issues to use the apps. For some reasons, I have never registered  the app online but their system showed that I had and asking me for pin number and memorable words.Phoned them up answered somewhere in India by someone who couldn’t even spell her own name in a NATO phonetic alphabet manner. Explained why I called. Told her all the information she needed to prove I am legit, including order number etc. Asking for pin number again, what pin number (?) which I don’t have. Then told me I did not pass the security check. I asked which questions I failed and was told the info I gave didn’t match. What info ? Told me a link in a rush which I had to clarify repeatedly.  Requested to speak to their supervisor but was told they could not help me !!!!!! I needed to go to reset my security details when I haven’t even registered in the first place.I went to the website she recommended, guess what. Same thing happened…. “The security code you entered doesn’t match what we have sent. Please enter it exactly as it appears in the text.”I have just done that !!!!!!!!!! Look like I have to visit a Vodafone branch IN PERSON to sort this out. I have never used such a lousy app and customer services like Vodafone.

Today is 10 and I am still not able to use my phone when I am home. Very disappointed for now. LOCATION IS South West London.",0
Internet was fine for 6 months then nothing but issues. Seems to be fine for several weeks then speeds drop from 900 to 12. Last for a week of 2. As by time you phone them they go through the and list of we need to send an update oh we need to reset router. Well I purchased another router so no it’s not the router. You throttle speeds when you’re not meant to. 12 is a joke when you pay for 900. You think I don’t have anything better than phoning you every night or 2Same time every night speeds drop from 8pm to 11:30 pm. You throttle speeds when you say you don’t. All you can say is you don’t see an issue even when I send pics you still blame router even after I changed it. I swap between both routers to prove it’s not mine as well.Worst mistake I’ve ever done is join Vodafone. Train your team better as well. Useless. I’m paying £40 odd pound a month so my son can complain every night he can’t play his computer,0
I used to like Vodafone and even wrote a good review regarding their service. Recently I've been extremely disappointed with them and stressed with the bad service. My broadband went down randomly with no reason. Vodafone was unable to fix it. So I asked then to cancel my landline and broadband - I was instantly blackmailed by cancellation fees etc. I asked if I will get compensation for the service when my broadband was down. This was refused although Vodafone website says that they will compensate £9.76 per day of outage. I guess that promise didn't stand! So I currently have no broadband and am relying on poor mobile reception which is also unfortunately provided by Vodafone. The worst part of my experience was the blackmailing with cancellation fees as soon as it became apparent to Vodafone that I'm going to cancel. It's sad that such a huge and good mobile provider has lost its way.,0
Either go to a store or select another provider - Vodafone's online servicer is impenetrable...,0
"Network service is absolutely shocking. I live in London and the fact that my 4G doesn’t work when I most need it is actually affecting my safety.I often rely on travel apps to give me routes and travel time for my journeys to and from work, and as it’s getting darker with the seasons, being Women and standing out at bus stops, on streets or outside stations trying to get a signal so I can check my route home is putting my safety at risk.I’ve called Vodafone customer service 4 times this year since January complaining of this, they have ‘reset’ my network settings each time even though I’ve asked them to cancel my contract and each time it’s not improved on the slightest. But they’re demanding I pay an early termination fee of £200 even though they aren’t fulfilling their end of the contract by delivery a satisfactory service!I do not recommend Vodafone as a network provider and I definitely don’t recommend them based on their customer service!",0
"I'm utterly disappointed with Vodafone. I feel trapped in their 24-month contract with zero flexibility. If you try to leave early, be prepared for sky-high cancellation fees, even though their service is downright terrible!The network is unreliable, with constant signal drops and slow speeds, making it impossible to use my phone for even basic tasks. As for customer service, it's a nightmare—endless waiting times, unhelpful staff, and no resolution to any issue,making fun of you when you mention about offers from other providers.It's as if they don't care once you're locked into their contract.On top of that, their prices are way too high for the poor service they offer. Honestly, you'd expect premium service for what you're paying, but all you get is frustration.Avoid Vodafone if you can—they force you into long contracts with no way out unless you want to pay extortionate fees. You're better off looking elsewhere for better service at a more reasonable price!",0
"We are one of the few areas left in the UK that can't get a phone signal in our house and rely on our landline so that our elderly relatives can get hold of us. Whilst we can go over to a fully digital system, should the wifi go down it means that our elderly relatives can't get hold of us. I had a heart attack several years ago and obviously would like to know that should I be unfortunate enough to suffer another that I can actually call for an ambulance. We also have a family member who suffers from an illness that strikes suddenly and means they are taken into hospital but then needs our support.Vodafone keep trying to upgrade us to the new system but cannot resolve the issues above. We have spent hours on the phone trying to sort things with them.Whilst we are on holiday we have received notification that they are going to upgrade us, even though we haven't requested it. We spent over an hour on the phone to them a few days ago but couldn't resolve things and another hour on the phone today (as we speak) we are just going round in circles with an operator who follows a set script and can't really help. We have been with Vodafone more years than I can remember but their telephone customer support is woeful and we are now looking to go to another provider.",0
"Hugely disappointed with Vodafone - my mobile data simply switched off the last week of August. Reason unknown. For someone who’s out of the house a lot and needs mobile data to be able to carry out day to day activities, this was a tremendous inconvenience.Customer service online did some trouble shooting, with no success. They advised me to go to a local Vodafone shop so the SIM card could be changed… Right around that time, however, I had to travel overseas which meant 3 weeks of continued inconvenience and no access to the Internet.Upon my return to the country, I swiftly visited a Vodafone shop. They couldn’t fix it, despite changing the SIM card twice. The only solution was to deactivate my number for 4 days (imagine not having your number and people not being able to reach you!) while a different solution was attempted.This luckily fixed the issue but at what cost! A complaint on my behalf was filed by the Vodafone shop service people while I was with them and today I received a call where I was offered a credit for two months as a compensation. Laughable! Vodafone needs to try much harder to keep their customers happy, especially if they deactivate my number to fix their network issues!I requested escalation of the complaint.In all honesty, as soon as this is sorted, I’m switching over to another provider. My husband had a similar issue with Vodafone last year… They are just not up to the mark!",0
"Joined as a new customer in April 2024 and had issues from start with intermittent service .

Fixed by August 14th and engineer found long standing fault exterior to property which was intact #VodafoneUK's issue  which I knew all along. For complete breakdown of service Vodafone don't pay you anything for day 1 and 2 then £9+ for each day after . So in my case 5 ×£9+ owing £45+ . All along from April to August the service was down up to 14 times a day ( Vodafones figures not mine) and on Friday 4th they offered a compensation package of what they owed me anyway plus 00.000021 of a penny per day for the outages . Like numerous other calls they absolutely promised to phone back ,they didn't of course . Instead a complaint was raised(again) and the package from Friday vanished ( no surprise) off screen . Since then it's taken another 4 days ,seeing another 3 complaints opened ( all since mysteriously shut down) and still not resolved and of course it won't be . If ##VodafoneUK reply to this review it will be the same company format * We are so sorry to hear of your experience, we offer the finest customer care .

"Bad experiences with this company tell me that paying for a service not long time ago was less agony and I felt less frustrated with a potentially bad experience.Today's services are based on a far west scenario with unpredictable perspectives if we keep going like that.Exception made for the vodafone Manager and staff in my town of Trowbridge ( thank you), the company's online customer service must have extensive customer service training because what they are offering now, is unacceptable...Especially after going through the account holder's identity checks, and asking for a simple document that you can't get only online.I will get straight to the point.It's incomprehensible that for a change of an account holder in an ongoing contract that ends in March 2025 be charged £34 in exit fees!I haven't asked to exit, just changed the contract ownership name on it because it's a joint property.My former wife's money would be no different to my money, just until the contract ends, likely soon, afterwards.Sorry, but this is honestly, ridiculous.I hope the people who have the power to change this unfair contract and condition clause, will remove this article from the companies that considering this particular case of requesting a contract holder change...

"Went with vodafone full 'superfast' fiber after leaving sky. All installed November last year. It worked for 3 months and I STILL have a NET ticket open from 20th February 2024!! I was told there is an 'event' happening currently which is why I am being throttled. It was 3.3mbps at the weekend and now I cant even stream any basics. Furthermore, I was also told that there is no timescale as to when this event will be completed and that I will continue to get no fiber until this has been done. Also, I have been offererd NO compensation or discounts as apparently you 'cant' because there is no estimated timescales. So almost a year of broadband and I have 3 months at best. I have shifted EVERYTHING over to Vodafone from Sky and for what? An absolute disgrace of a company. Im hoping someone from Vodafone reach out after reading this as I am on the verge of cancelling my direct debit as you still expect me to pay FULL service whilst this issue of 8 months continues.

What a complete joke of a company there turning into. Been with them for years with my internet and phone for all the family.Just had the joy of speeking to Joy Kimble who says he is a senior executive at the broadband activation team and after my 8th phone call that’s over a hour in length was at my wits end. He was absolutely no help in understanding what was going wrong and you just get passed from employee to employee with some trying to help but quite clearly not got the ability to help and some as above ( Joy ) who was just out right rude and took major offence when I said I was struggling to understand his English and could I possibly Speek to a better Speeking advisor.My contract was comeing to an end and I upgraded to pro 2 910 speed broadband the most expensive and best available. Everything going very smooth fully connected super quick then the switch my contact without my consent. They have all ready said this was there own doing and was a problem with there back offfice what ever that means. So I ask to put in a complaint as I have 8time what has been refused every time can’t even get to Speek to that department. Then they cut off my internet on Monday again without my consent and said yet again this was there error. This will not be sorted for 8 days with me sending all of the working equipment back to be sent the same equipment back again. Because the cancellation was placed I can’t put in a complaint about them cancellation and you can’t complain about a internet as I have not got working internet so have to wait for it to work to put in a complaint about it not working. Confusing is it trying sorting this mess out. Honestly if it all works good you will be fine but the customer service care is honestly the worst I have ever come across with a language barrier makeing it impossible for anyone fully understanding what is even going on.I have not working tv now as I streamI have had to take a day off work Monday as was to be working from homeI have spent over a working day on the phone without getting this all sorted outThis has really shown me just how much we depend on internet now and you would think with being a loyal customer you would be looked after but that’s just not the case. Very very alarming that your contract can be changed then cancelled without your consent and then there employees acting like you have cancelled this is your fault. I hope this is not a common problem but you would think a complaint’s manger would be straight on the case with this and sort it out asap. Think you can see from the number of 1 start reviews that if you have a good working system eta expect a good service if you have any problems at all be in for a big big shock as unfortunately the customer service after care has to be one of the worst for one of the biggest companies in the world. Hopefully this helps people who are looking to switch anything over to be well aware it could end up being a nightmare.,0
"If Vodafone broadband is anything  like thier mobile phone coverage in my area NR5 9HE, forget it.If you complain they tell you the mobile mast is awaiting repairs and circa two years later we are still waiting. Now they have replied but want me to contact them on one of three social media sites none of them I use!",0
"I tried to sign up for a 2 year broadband contract at £36 per month.The Vodafone website simply failed at the checkout: no ability to join them.Rang Customer Service to JOIN Vodafone and only got muzak and apology they were too busy message.If that is how they treat people who WANT to become customers, imagine how you will be treated when you have signed up.",0
This is my first day and i am not excited for what's to come. As soon as my contract started I was put on a free trial which was told I had to cancel by signing into my vodafone which is already annoying. Then I couldn't register to my vodafone to cancel the secure net plan thing so I called the customer service up. I said I had an issue with my vodafone and the customer service hung up on me and told me to go online to the Tobi bot to try and fix I. The tobi bot was useless so I asked for an advisor. the advisor manged to just remove my trial thing which I didn't want but told me I had to put a dot in the chat every 2 mins otherwise the chat would close down. Just awful service.,0
I used OneCom who use Vodafone both companies are appalling as far as I am concerned. I had  2 year contract Just as the equipment comes out of warranty guess what the phone starts overheating and freezing. OneCom doesnt want to know neither do Vodafone. So i am expected to carry on paying £5-0 a month for a phone that is very dangerous and a fire hazard the law needs changing. I would not recommednd either company to anyone wanting a contract phone. STAY CLEAR ESPECIALLY ONECOM THDEY ARE CROOKS.,0
I’ve been with Vodafone fo probably about 15 years and I’m absolutely gob smacked how horrific my signal has been the last 18 months.I even splashed out on a b try and new iPhone thinking it was my phones fault.I feel like it’s 2005 again?!We live  in London so it’s not as if I’m in the sticks.I can’t feel confident to travel around the country using sat nav on my phone anymore or pay for parking etc.I call and twiddle this invs around and nothing happens. It’s just incomprehensible with such a huge provider.Were just so stitched in as have broadband (also hit and miss) and hubbys phone all with renewal dates at different times.I’d not mind if they compensated me or admitted fault but they don’t and I just waste hours and hours on the phone.If you are thinking of joining or really wouldn’t.,0
"Mobile wifi does not work consistently and cuts out intermittently during the day. I've tried multiple times to cancel this and I'm told the fee will be £400+. It is just unbelievable I am stuck with this, and unable to buy fast reliable internet with another provided as I'm tied into this contract. I can't afford another monthly fee on top of this one. My partner works from home, and has cut out of many online video calls. It is embarrassing and she is now worried about her job security for this reason now.",0
The staff are a joke as soon as you have a problem don’t want to know when I have paid for my phone in a few months will see if I can go with another service provider the staff and customer service are a joke,0
"Several times I've emailed Vodafone for a NUC (network unlock code).Each time I am told that I'll either get an immediate answer or I'll get the code in 2 weeks.To date (after several weeks), I'm still waiting. A day after I posted this message on Trust pilot I received a message from Vodafone.Hello. Thank you for requesting a Network Unlock Code (NUC) for your device - we're working on this now for you. We'll email you an update shortly, so keep an eye on your inbox. Remember to check your junk/spam folder if it hasnt arrived soon. I've subsequently heard nothing.",0
"Just another big corporation who can’t solve your problem, extremely poor signal in central london and just bounce the problem back to me with multiple advisors who don’t care, don’t keep good records or read previous records. So frustrating and at the end of the day immensely bad customer service. Pathetic. Don’t trust. Don’t use.",0
"Customer service is atrocious. No 5g on an iPhone 15 for 10 months, took 10 calls ( 15+ hours), 3 shop visits and 5 live chats to fix the problem which came about through me researching and telling support what to do.Was offered (when I called up ) £10 VOUCHER as compensation. Eventually worked this to £150.Tried to leave the company but told no unless you pay leaving contract fee. Only reason I signed up to a new contract was I was told this may fix the issue. I didn’t.",0
Just Update !today 7/10/2024 replacement device don't offered from Vodafone .Created Case already !contacted all social media platforms and same no improvement just promises !!!!!Avoid this company canceled all direct debits !Be aware people !Never had this bad experience!!!!!!,0
"I have used multiple pay as you go numbers over the years...and had taken 1 subscription back in 09/2022.The phone got stolen right after signing the paperwork and up until today the Vodafone staff has charged me a monthly £15,- for a service I never used.Each time I walked into the shop, showing ID and requested to stop taking money, they'd stop me by saying I can no longer give the number or pin ..as I simply forgot...so they keep charging me and I now got a notification on my credit score that it is going down due to unpaid Vodafone bills..very disappointed. Definitely never taking out anymore future products of them.",0
"Vodafone Internet is a joke. Sometimes pages not loading in city centers with full 4g.Moved to Vodafone as apparently they have better coverage indoors, they don't.Don't waste your money with this carrier as it's rubbish.",0
"I have moved house and even though I was sold 'alexa built in' deal, they're now telling me they don't support Alexa so I have been missold this deal. Also, several times I have called up to help with setting up the vodafone braodband app and every tiem they say someone will call me back but no one has for weeks, even when I call them back. Very unhappy with their service and Will be lookign to cancel my deal ASAP.",0
"Easily the worst customer service experience ever. By a mile. No contest. Just absolutely awful. Gross incompetence combined with a complete lack of accountability. Well done Vodafone, you are setting new standards.Changed 2 x mobile phones to Vodafone as well as home broadband and seem to have spent my entire time chasing them. Phones came later than expected. Broadband has taken 3 hours (so far) of chasing as the router and associated kit still hasn’t arrived yet Vodafone informed my old broadband provider that they would be taking over the line leaving us without broadband for an unspecified period of time with my wife trying to work from home.Now trying to work out a way to cancel both mobile phones, home broandband and all mobile phones at the company I run (all with Vodafone) as this has been such an awful experience.No one will put me through to a manager or a complaints department. Everyone keeps assuring me that everything will be fine when it is just a litany of failures.Awful, just utterly awful. Avoid like the plague. Come back EE, all is forgiven!!!!",0
"Switched to Vodafone broadband from Sky as the latter had increased their prices two years running and Vodafone had a good deal on (both use the Openreach network so in theory there should be no difference in service). I was so wrong. We live in a small 2 bed cottage and can’t get signal just metres away from the router, it’s a constant source of frustration and we’re resorting to using our mobile data instead, we can’t stream music to our speakers either without regular cut outs. With Sky the whole house had wifi signal. When I called to complain they simply said they don’t guarantee coverage and I should buy a wifi booster. Why on earth should we have to fork out money to compensate for their useless cheap router? How about providing a router that meets basic  standards? Most houses are bigger than ours. Furthermore, other networks such as Virgin Media provide this for free if their hub coverage is inadequate. We’re now trapped for another 18 months… Never again and nor will I be recommending them to anyone.Also beware… their free gift card that entices new customers has a couple of terms to catch you out, you can’t claim for 3 months (by which point you will have forgotten about it) and then only have 3 months to claim it. Needless to say I only remembered to claim a couple of days after it had expired and unsurprisingly they said tough luck… There is no reason why the gift card can’t be valid for the duration of the contract except to catch customers out. So glad I have never been a mobile customer and now never will be.Update in response to their reply on here: Like I said Vodafone are useless and their reply is consistent with that. The issue is not a fault but their sub standard cheap router equipment they provide as standard which can’t even provide WiFi coverage for a small property. I’ve been with many providers over the years, and never had this issue with anyone else.",0
"Chichester Vodafone branch woes.I’ve just ungraded my IPhone Pro 13 to the latest Pro 16.I did this online and it was straight forward and easy, I opted to use the old iPhone as a trade in to reduce the monthly costs.I selected Chichester Vodafone branch for the drop off.After a long wait with no customer in front of me Sam handled my drop off.Phone dropped off with digital receipt,  a week later Vodafone still saying that they haven’t received it.I’ve had trouble with the Chichester branch of Vodafone before and feel quite foolish using them again.It’s a shame as Vodafone online and over the phone agents are excellent.Their Chichester high street store is rubbish!!!",0
The manager Ivanovitch was so rude and refused to serve me after I waited 1hr 30 mins JUST FOR A SIM CARD! Instead he was flirting with the girl who was in front of me. I was obviously mad at this point as I had plans which were ruined just for him to say he’s not going to serve me. Also his little minion praise needs to know when to stop talking. In conclusion hate this place from the bottom of my heart and do not recommend anyone to come .,0
"I disconnected my service to move to a new provider. The agent told me it would disconnect Oct 8. They disconnected it 4 days early. When I asked support, they couldn’t reconnect it, and flatly refused to compensate the difference. 4 days without service and told to go do one when they clearly understood the mistake was entirely theirs. Useless support. Avoid!!!",0
"Ordered a home broadband package last month; including setting up direct debits. Received notification of a go-live date; and told to expect equipment delivery a few days before this.Go-live date now almost 2 weeks late, no equipment recieved. Contacted Vodafone, and once through the agonising security check (as no account details so the customer services rep has to use alternative questions), I am told that the order was cancelled, but they are not able to give a reason, date or identification of the cancellation.Will definitely not use them in future.",0
VODAFONE are becoming a disgrace I've recently upgraded my phone and contract with VODAFONE and since new contract started I've had nothing but problems with VODAFONE I've had to contact them again today because they are demanding a new payment from me even though my account is up to date regarding payments they say if I don't pay within next 2 days they are going to restrict my account I've spoken to VODAFONE and they are now trying to tell me that they didn't contact me even though they emailed and text me 4 days ago and text me again today demanding payment,0
"Once again the issue continues. I have been disconnected without me requesting it and on the reconnection date it did not happen. I called and could not get through and sent an email of complaint but no response. I have now received a bill for a months worth of charges and I have not been able to use this service since July. Refund my bill and compensation is required. As they have broken my contract by disconnecting my service the. This contract is now ceased. DO NOT USE this service! In response to Vodafone’s reply, I have tried this.",0
"** update ** Vodafone never contacted or raised another complaint as reply suggests.Stayed with Vodafone Broadband on the promise they’d solve the issues we had when we changed from normal broadband to fibre with a new router.  All problems have persisted. I’ve spent countless hours going in circles on chat and phone calls.  Call centre is abroad and as lovely and friendly as the team are the language barrier means you’ll forever get trapped in hour long circles where your on hold whilst they “ look into it “ only to be told yet again it’ll be passed to the mysterious “ back end team “ and you’ll be contacted within 24 hrs. Which never happens.   And then 48+ hrs later you get one missed call out of the blue and they class it as resolved.The app is horrifically useless and is still linked to our old router.  Different teams and individuals have wasted hours of our time promising if we just stay on the line they’ll fix it. Never fixed.  WiFi swaps between frequency which disconnects most of our devices and interiors watching telly / our outdoor cameras/ the baby monitor and even Alexa which we use to keep our baby soothed by playing music.I’d not recommend this company and will be raising another complaint as they closed the last one as thought suggestion we download the app on my partner ( who’s never homes phone) would solve the issue of the app account not working. They even deleted our entire account and let me have the joy of doing the entire sign up process again on my own knowing I have three young kids , again didn’t even solve the problem.  I’ve wasted so many hours on the phone and chat. Nothings resolved. No one’s helpful and the call centres abroad can only read from scripts and if they don’t understand your issue they’ll just waste your time passing you between teams all saying they’ll fix and then when they can’t passing you to another , leave you on hold whilst they reread your account so you don’t have to repeat yourself then repeatedly interpret the problem wrong and waste more time. This has been ongoing since May or before now.Really really do not recommend if you value your time enough to not want to spend hours on the phone and then be ghosted and not called back with no bill deductions for your wasted time and their lack of services provided.",0
"WILL NEVER go back.NEVER BUY the Gigacube. I have had one myself for over a year now, and on a really lucky day, you might just get to watch one video on one device, if the cube is RIGHT next to you.I have raised my issue with Vodafone numerous times, not only do they blame you for their cube not working, they question whether you were smart enough to know how Wifi even works. Their product does not work, I am paying a high amount every month and they won’t let me leave. If you raise a problem with them, they will wash hands of responsibility and refer you to another company to complain to.DO NOT BUY GIGACUBE. It will not work, and their excuse is that ‘the whole of the uk doesn’t have 4g yet’ DESPITE promising me it’ll work perfectly in my area, even promising 5G speeds. As a long term Vodafone user, I am disgusted in their customer service towards me and their lack of help. To get out of my contract just under a year early for a non-working product  is nearly a grand! Will shout from the rooftops to anyone who would listen to NOT go to Vodafone.",0
Network speed slower than slow! I pay for Unlimited Max data and yet download speed is less than 10Mbps!18 months ago i enjoyed 40Mbps download speed then last year it dropped to 20Mbps and this year it is less than 10Mbps. I have contacted them previously but their support people just give one size fits all answers.If your reading this Mr Vodafone please give me a contact number to phone so i can speak to someone who knows what is what.,0
it now seems that to go into your vodaphone shop fpr some help you will have to book an appointment for which they will charge you £25.that leaves me with the option of finding another supplier and i dont think i will be alone .,0
"Having cancelled my phone contract (or so I thought!) in 2022, I have discovered Vodafone have continued to charge me. This despite my having rung them and explaining that as they were offering such poor renewal deals, I would purchase a phone and contract from a 3rd party. Bizarrely this was a Vodafone contract still, but I was not allowed to port my number. My old number was completely dead, so I assumed it was cancelled. Over 55 minutes on the phone, mostly on hold. Shocking customer service on all levels.",0
"Don't take a Vodafone contract, they are appalling. If you do try to cancel an out of contract service, it's  almost impossible.  It takes hours out of your life and then what they have confirmed in writing, it doesn't actually happen. I'm a customer of 25 years and I'm desperately trying to get out of an after contract product that they just keep taking my money for. They won't split ddm, and won't refund for incorrect billing for an in contract product.They are a horrible fat cat global organisation that just sucks every penny they can out of you. Would give negative stars if possible.",0
We have been without business broadband for months now.,0
"same as all the other providers.They scam you if you stay loyal to them. spent 2 hours going round chats with different employees to get a better deal, only for the last one to end the chat when i realised, and pointed out to them, that they were trying to 'discount the broadband' but sell me a sim only plan at a higher price than i could achieve on their website,",0
"network problems. for a few weeks I can't use the phone at all because they were doing what repairs are related to the network, despite that I paid the bills normally, I have not received a refund for this period. I do not recommend them and I will never go back to them",0
"For 7 years we have had sky broadband with no issues at all.We changed to Vodafone for the price.Yesterday we had a guy come around and hook us up to Vodafone with no issues, all working fine, good speed etcThat was until 23:00 when we lost all broadband, we have called and logged an issue to be told it’s going to take two days to resolve! My husband works from home so this is absolutely not good enough.If you have supplier with good speed think twice before leaving.",0
"Archie gave me false information, when it came to upgrading felt like I was a nuisance. Feel like the manager and Archie need training I asked if I upgraded could I pay the phone loan of as it’s interest free he said I had to wait 3 months which is not true at all he even asked the manager who provided the false info. This is not professional whatsoever? Also as I was speaking him and a fellow colleague kept looking at eachother felt all uncomfortable called customer service and upgraded basic information was not given. Not happy on the other hand 3 across the road was very helpful.",0
"Called with a simple billing enquiry.  Not only was it very hard to get hold of a real person, when I did, their accent was so thick I could barely understand a word, and ultimately they directed me back to the Vodafone website because they couldn't help.  Totally unsatisfactory experience from all angles.  Think it was a foreign call centre but who knows?",0
Cannot manage my account on the website. Both the website and virtual assistant direct me to the app. I can’t get the app because our phones are on the US App Store. How can such a big company be so useless? I feel like I should have a right to access my account on the website since that’s where I opened it I should be able to cancel it there. Just trying to cancel my pay as you go autopay. Shouldn’t take hours to do that.,0
"Big mistake, firstly it’s so expensive so you can get the same deals much cheaper even Vodafone contracts if you do it from different companies it’s much cheaper, secondly the service it’s so bad in Milton Keynes specially in mk central!!! even in London you in middle of something and you need to do a little research it will hinging no service or gust freezing it’s so frustrating also when you make phone call keeps losing connection. The WiFi it’s so bad as well. They don’t respect their customers and sending texts messages when they do maintenance somewhere. That’s why they trapped you in 2 years contract. It is a big mistake never renew it anymore west of the time and money highly unrecommended 👎🏻",0
"No access to bills, no help, no service at all",0
New update from Vodafone Uk ! Already two weeks no replacement phone provided! Already took from my account £50 pounds deposit £31 pounds phone monthly costs but I have no phone provided! This Company Joke! Be aware people! No contacts from Vodafone!,0
"Installation day did not happen for my 92 year old Aunt till 6 days later and only happened after constantly phoning them up, speaking to customer service who kept asking for my ,92 year old Aunt to ring them on her mobile? As if she has one. Terrible service and I question Trust pilot ratings on how Vodafone has 4.5% rating when only 60% give it 5 star and 36% give it 1 star....",0
"Absolutely appalling service and customer service. Supposedly premium service to allow me to work from home and for my son to game. Within the first week, without service for 10 days. I was talked out of cancelling my contract with the promise that the service would be sorted. So I ended up outside of the 14 day cooling off period.Then had another slow speed problem which lasted another week. We were promised that if it happened again, I could cancel the contract without fees. We’re now 6 months into the contract and we’ve had another week with too slow speeds to be functional. Vodafone now tell me it’s fixed but the upload speeds are so slow that I cannot work from home. They now tell me they don’t guarantee upload speeds (despite the fact that this current service is not fit for purpose) and that I cannot cancel the contract without fees. As far as I can see, I’m within my Consumer Rights as it’s not fit for purpose, but they are arguing they have now restored download speeds so I can’t cancel. So I’ve now had 15 working days in 6 months where I’ve been unable to work from home. Their App doesn’t work correctly and won’t let me input information properly. Until this week I’ve been unable to access my account online. Their customer service reps say they’ll ring you back but don’t and all I get is every reason under the sun for why I can’t cancel my contract - they only guarantee download speeds, they only guarantee them if using an Ethernet connection (despite seeking this product as multiple device!). They won’t guarantee anything if you’re using a VPN etc…. Disgusting!",0
Purchased their fibre 500 broadband package online. Received confirmation of contract and delivery dates for router… within a few days the contract was cancelled by Vodafone for no reason when we phoned they couldn’t access the account and then couldn’t give us the same offer… shambles,0
Just bought into Voda phoneLand line has never worked Wifi poor and defenatly worse that my last provider.Called the one line then a phone call kept asking me to plug in my spare land line phone to test teh line . Who keeps a spare land line phone. She eventualy hung up . I still need help,0
"I lost the use of my data on Saturday 28 September. I contacted the helpline several times and tried various troubleshooting to no avail. I was told on Saturday afternoon by the helpline that the only way to get my data back was to disconnect and reconnect my service. I was told this should happen within a few minutes or at worst a few hours and this was the only way to fix my issue. Vodafone would work closely with me and contact me regularly to update me. this reassured me that everything would be OK. I was disconnected on Saturday afternoon so could not make any calls and had no data, Vodafone called on my landline at 5pm to say I would be reconnected soon but in any event they would call me back at 11am on the Sunday and it would all be sorted and they would be all over this.I went on the chat and called the helpline and I was told nothing could be done before Sunday pm as I had to wait 24 hours. I called the helpline again several times and more chat and was then told could be 48 hours and then could be 72 hours and then could be 5 days. In a panic I went to the Putney store on the Monday - paid for parking and waited 45 minutes to see someone. They said that I should not have been disconnected and if I had gone into the store they would have been able to fix my issue. They went on the SOS helpline to try to move my case forward as I still had no phone line and no data. I went home and tried again on the Tuesday with the helpline to no avail so went to the Putney store again. I was sent an esim to install on my phone so I did this and then had 2 phone lines - one of which worked and still no data. The Putney store sorted out the eSIM so I could make calls and had data. Vodafone complaints called on the Tuesday afternoon to say that although I had service and data my number was not attached to my account so I could not be billed and I when I contacted friends andand family it was not coming up as my number. Vodafone complaints said they would contact the technical team and come back 24 hours later between 3 and 5 pm the following day. I had no call from Vodafone compliants and then my case was moved to a second case handler and then a third. I was then told that my phone would need to be disconnected again and reconnected to fix the problem. I was told I would be called before any disconnection and updated.I left my house for a meeting and my phone was disconnected and service and data lost. I had to return back home. I was sent an eSIM to restart my phone. The eSIM did not work. I asked to speak to the technical team as thought I should delete the other eSIms there but I was told I was not allowed to speak to the technical team. Advice given was I needed a physical SIM so I should wait for one to arrive in the post or visit a store. I said I did not think this was correct and could I speak to a technical expert but this was refused. I could not face going on the helpline or chat again so drove 30 minutes in traffic to the Vodafone store, paid for parking and waited for 30 minutes to see a technician. They remove the old eSIMs and fixed my phone service and data without the need for a physical SIM in store. The advice was incorrect. I have been offered a £150 credit for all this incorrect advise and poor service and days of wasted time. I do not think the compensation is adequate but without spending more time on this there is nothing further to do. I wouldn't try Vodafone's chat or helpline. The stores seem better trained.",0

"Contract expired June 2024. Moved house in September. Called up on 12 September to cancel phone/ broadband as had new provider. Advised that they couldn't cancel or disconnect (!) and that my new provider would. I cancelled direct debit. Then got threatening late payment notification. Used chat on 04 Oct, who took another £30.16 (despite me having previously advised that I'd moved, was out of contract and wanted to cancel). Chat team couldn't cancel the account and then advised £5 late payment fee would be taken next bill. Eventually transferred me to someone called Amber who was actually helpful and processed the disconnection request that could, and should have been done on 12th September",0
"Order was placed on 12th September 2024 and installation was carried out by Cityfibre on 1st October 2024 and I am still without broadband on 4th October 2024.

Absolutely shocking. Had broadband since March and had nothing but issues. Constantly calling to be told no issues. Now I have no broadband service at all to be told can't get anyone out until Tuesday. So I have to go from yesterday until Tuesday with no Internet at home. Can't work. Can't watch TV. Get it together Vodafone. I will be cancelling my dd and not paying for any services until you fix the issues,0
"I cannot get wifi upstairs in my home. I have been reporting this for months to Vodafone.

"This is an awful company. Throughout my 3 years of being with them. I have had to endure an infuriating level of terrible customer service.Some members of staff have been lovely. When you finally get past the awful automated system.The communication was awful between stores and the company itself. I visited a branch loads of times to try and cancel my broadband because I moved address. They did not cancel this and after paying for it for a year without using it they cancelled it stating I was cancelling it again. I then thought I was being hacked and this again could’ve been avoided by some communication from themIt came to the end of contract! I was overjoyed! I thought the final bill had gone through and I cancelled the direct debit. I was almost so happy I could’ve celebrated. Then the cherry on the cake for me, was another month went by, they had referred me to a debt collection company saying I didn’t pay the final bill. Again, the anxiety and stress of this whole ordeal could’ve been avoided if they had communicated to me.They are now trying to say they sent texts. I didn’t receive anyAvoid them like the plague, they’re unsympathetic to personal circumstances and do not care about you as a customerI’ve reported them to offcom. If you have similar experiences, do the same",0
Three weeks after taking a contact with Vodafone I am still waiting for Vodafone to supply the phone to me.Apparently they can not provide a date for supplying it.A bad decision choosing Vodafone.I now want my £50 upfront fee back.As I'm paying for a phone I can't use perhaps trading standards should get involved.Oh look. Vodafone just replied with the exact same reply as three weeks ago.Probably not written by a real person. Just AI standard response.Pathetic really.,0
I only ever saw John in the store. As he is no longer there I will not go into the store again. The staff in the store now does not want to help older people.,0
"This is another example of the bigger the company is, the worse experience you get. I tried to buy broadband from them - an impossible task. Before buying, you get automatically redirected and they ask you to enter your current provider, which I do not have. There is no option such as ""none"" or similar, therefore the system does not allow you to proceed further. The person who designed this must be braindead, without considering that there are people who do not have broadband at all. I tried to solve this by contacting them via chat - it was even worse. There is a stupid bot that does not understand anything and then it asks for my phone number. The website design is so bad that it does not even allow you to enter a phone number, the window just stays gray. Lastly, I tried calling them - again mission impossible, nobody picks up the phone no matter how long I wait. Gave up. If the experience of trying to become a customer is this miserable, I can only imagine the level of frustration and poor service that I would encounter AFTER signing the contract and becoming a customer.",0
You asked me to contact Tobi your chatbot. This is such an insult. I have waisted so much time trying to resolve my issue with your customer service team. I have made complaints that have been disregard. Now you want me to take it up with a chatbot who after going through stupid questions doesn't recognise my phone number because I am no longer with Vodafone. AVOID THIS COMPANY.,0
"Vodafone,  I rang to get some help about my bill in July 2024 to explain the double payment the call handler was rude and spoke over me.  I rang again as the same thing happened in October 2024, I requested to discuss this with someone in charge as I was getting no help.  I was kept waiting on the phone for 30mins with no explanation.  I will take this further.",0
"THE WORST. There is literally NOTHING good about this network. I am stuck with it because i live rurally, but if you are in a city USE GIFF GAFF. Vodafone are just after your money, they make everything difficult, if you want to change a plan or bundle they make it night on impossible. Honestly the Worst app and the worst company. completely wasting my time trying to do the simplest of tasks",0

"More than two years they can't fix the reception signal issue on Whaldarke  and Mortlake Road in Sheffield, no internet for mobile data and onw bar signal for call. While our privet and bussenes lifedepends to internet ignoring around 200 families is not the good. When calling to customer service always the same answer our system shows every thing is good, that's all, come to the area and see who's right. If someone dosn't compline it mean they already live Vodafone after facing this issues. I don't wanna hear sorry when I'm loosing my bussenes and nerve, fix the problem",0
I made the mistake of signing up for Lookout security with Vodafone at the start of my contract. After a year of paying for something that I didn’t use I contacted Vodafone by phone to ask them to cancel Lookout security. I was told it was cancelled as the year long subscription had ended but I continue to be charged nearly £6 more a month for something I asked to be cancelled.,0
