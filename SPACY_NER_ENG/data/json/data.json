        "\" As a long-standing T-Mobile customer subscribed to the Magenta® Amplified plan with three voice lines , my experience with the company has been consistently positive without any notable issues. However , on January 15 , 2024 , we initiated contact with T-Mobile to help us navigate plans and get the best deal possible at that time. To stay on the current plan and purchase all new phones and increase our monthly bill from $ 157 to $ 270 or switch to a more expensive plan and get promotions. We opted to switch to the Go5G Next plan , which involved trading in three devices : upgrading from an iPhone 12 to an iPhone 15 Pro and obtaining one complimentary iPhone 15 due to adding a line. During this process , 2 different T-Mobile representatives assured us that , after factoring in all eligible discounts , including a teacher discount , our monthly bill would total $ 230. The process included 3 steps including changing the plan which is only possible by phone service. We trusted representatives to do it correctly , but unfortunately , it was not the case. The wrong code was applied to one of the lines , the other code was expired and had no value.Despite receiving three new iPhone 15 Pros and one iPhone 15 on January 17 , our account still reflected details from the previous Magenta plan. It was only last week that T-Mobile finally updated our account to the Go5G Next plan , resulting in a monthly bill exceeding $ 349. It feels that we are trapped because according to the agreement we only have 20 days to make changes , but our account information was not updated till it was too late. Until that time ( February 6 ) we were sure that our bill would be $ 230 , not $ 349 like it is stated now.Upon noticing this discrepancy , I promptly contacted T-Mobile to seek a resolution. Despite investing significant time on the phone with various representatives , the issue with our bill persisted unresolved. I hate to be trapped : phones we used for trade-in can not be returned to us , and codes for the trade-in are incorrect. The customer service department wasted hours on “investigation’ to come up with “Unfortunately we can not fix the problem as all those deals are expired now . \" ",

        "\" Our old phone carrier shut down so we were forced to change carriers. I went to a T-Mobile store in Maize , KS and Maria , the lady that helped me , told me we would definitely have 5G coverage where we live. I questioned her about that several times during our interaction because my husband and I live very rural and when I looked at the coverage map before heading into the store , coverage looked spotty. She kept telling me we would FOR SURE have 5G coverage. I did n't purchase a new phone until I knew it would work at our house. After a couple weeks , I decided to purchase a new device with them because we at least had 4G coverage. Then , shortly after the 14 day return period expired , our service is almost nonexistent. I called customer service and the guy I spoke to informed me that he would have never sold us a plan and phones because his map showed almost no coverage where we live. He told me that we basically get \" \" left over \" \" signals from a tower that is very far away from us and the reason we do n't have service now is because they were having problems with said tower. I asked when the tower was going to be up and he said he did n't know. Now , we do n't get service , thank goodness we have wifi or my new expensive phone ( that they wo n't let me pay off early or return ) would be a paper weight. The only way out from under them now is to pay off mine and my husband 's devices at full retail pricing , not just the sale pricing. My husband 's phone has n't even left the box , but we ca n't return it. I asked the customer service guy if there 's anything we can do since we do n't have service and he said , \" \" No , nothing. \" \" So basically we have to pay ridiculous prices to them but our phones only work on wifi , that we also have to pay for. I 'm extremely disappointed with T-Mobile. We 'll be switching to Verizon as soon as we 're able to . \" ",

        "\" I 'm 70 years old and never have I had a company promise ( voice and written ) to refund money for a mistake they made , and then take it back ! When I first approached this with T-mobile , they wanted to add the overcharged amount to my account. However , I wanted them to credit the amount to my credit card instead. After one month discussing this with four different representatives ( and hours wasting my time waiting on the phone ) , I spoke to a manager. She apologized for the inconvenience and trouble I had experienced with this issue. She said she would not only refund the money to my credit card but would add another $ 16 and , in addition , I would not have to pay the next month 's bill for $ 16. She also said she would send a confirmation email , and follow-up with me in one week with a phone call. Sounds good , right ? Well , she did email me the refund confirmation and they did cancel the next month 's bill. However , she never followed up with the phone call , and after a month , the refund still had not appeared on my credit card. When I called to inquire about this , I was told the company decided to revoke the refund. A multibillion dollar company revokes a $ 27.24 promised refund. How 's that for great customer service ? ! I 'll be quitting T-mobile and would not recommend them to anyone thinking of obtaining their service. Their word means nothing. Greedy with no ethical guidelines . \" ",

        "\" I went on-line on Saturday 14th December 24 to request the deal for the Apple iPhone 13 128 GB which was due to end at midnight on the 19th December. The girl I dealt with appeared very efficient and processed my order sending through my contract to my email address which I needed to sign within 72 hrs. When I went to sign the contract the following day that was when my nightmare started ! My husband noticed they had put the wrong address on the contract and my sort code was also incorrect. When I made contact with the team the following day they said they could amend the incorrect details but when I requested the new contract they said they could n't amend the contract as they would need to cancel the order and start again. I was not happy to sign a contract on-line which was incorrect and after a long time trying to explain this said they would have to cancel the contract and start again. I was advised to ring back the following day giving it time to cancel on the system. When I rang on the 17th December 2024 I initially spoke with someone who insisted I would have to accept the old contract which had n't been cancelled to get the deal despite me explaining that it had the wrong address and sort code. This gentleman put the phone down on me. With trepidation I phoned Vodafone back again on the 17th December once I went into my local Bishops Stortford store for some moral support at 3.20pm. I spoke to a gentleman on-line a Vodafone Customer Service called Stephan who was extremely rude and talked over me and after nearly two hours we were no further on with the process with him insisting the old contract was still online. The staff in store were extremely kind and supportive to me particularly Ben and his trainee , Ali , but unfortunately they could do nothing as the contract was still open on-line. Stephan advised to ring at 8am on the 18th December and he would cancel my original order. When I rang again today at 8am I spoke to Corrie who was polite and helpful but when he re-did the order again unfortunately when he got to the end of the process , it still would n't go through despite saying my order had been cancelled at 02.20am on the 18th. I was advised to ring again on the 19th which was the following day , noting that this deal ended at midnight on the 19th.I took the risk of ringing again today at 5.20pm and spoke to a very pleasant , empathetic young girl called Imaan , who was based in Lancaster. She reassured me that she would do her best to solve my problem and asked relevant questions which give me hope. At two different stages she checked with someone senior that the correct process was being followed and double checked my details with me to ensure everything was correct. She apologised for the distress I had encountered over the last four days with Vodafone and was genuinely caring towards me. Imaan managed to successfully process my order for the Apple iPhone and hopefully it will be delivered tomorrow. Her service was faultless. However the last four days has been an extremely distressing and stressful experience with the online service with Vodafone with each phone call at times taking up nearly two hours of my time. I praise Ben and Ali in the Bishops Stortford store and Lovely Imaan today but as for the other staff unfortunately I rate the overall service as poor.Where do we go from here , I would expect more than a written online apology for the time and stress this has caused me. I am sure Vodafone can do their homework and work out by the details I have provided who this service user is ! ! ! ! ! \" ",

Ordered the sim package on the Friday and was told SIM card would be despatched that day and I would receive it Monday. Monday came and no SIM card. Because I kept my old number they had transferred it to them so my service with EE ended which left me with no active phone ! I called and asked where my SIM card was and was told they would send another one which would take another 3 days ! They then said to go into a Vodafone shop ! I explained I worked long shifts at a hospital and shops are closed when I finish work so would have to wait the 3 days ! The original SIM card arrived on Thursday ! Postage mark on envelope showed they had n't posted it until the Tuesday ! ! ! So I have been without a phone service for 3 days bearing in mind I need to be contacted from work and I have an elderly parent who needs communication with me.

They have twice in that time just randomly removed my cell phone number ( and the first time they did that , they also stole the $ 100 of credit that was on the account ) . When they do delete your number it then becomes extremely difficult to get through to anyone in customer service and , if ( BIG IF ) you do manage to get through to someone , they are often unable to help resolve the issue. I am totally p****d with having to change cell phone number and update all my professional stationary , profiles and contacts because of AT & T 's complete disregard for their customers. The question is , who else to try ? These giant communications companies have a virtual monopoly and they could n't care less about their customers . \" ",

        "\" This is the second part of a review. Without going into long and boring detail , there was an issue with my daughter’s eSIM in Liverpool , with me ( the account holder ) in Brentwood Essex. On the first visit Liverpool staff sympathetic but unable to help. On the second visit , involving the very helpful Vodafone staff in Brentwood , the guy in the Liverpool store was appallingly rude to both my daughter and the Brentwood store staff , ( witnessed by all of us because it was on a FaceTime call ) leaving her in tears and us thinking that the only explanation for his conduct was that he was working his notice. When eventually the Brentwood staff asked how they could find a solution for this Vodafone customer , his response was to walk away , saying it wasn’t his problem. The zero score in the title is harsh , because the first Liverpool employee was at least polite and sympathetic , but the second fully deserves zero stars.PS. Are you seriously suggesting ( through the links below ) that the way to address this is through social media sites ? Is that how you do customer service ? \" ",

Period.We were strolling down grocery store and ATT guy lured us into Fiber Optic Internet connection which is supposed to be 'WOW'.I never bought the hype but they promised its cheaper than what we were paying and since my wife has been wireless user - we get additional $ 20 discount + $ 300 gift card.What happens next : Gift card never arrived - so I called - and they are like - oh but you did not confirm that you wanted gift card. W.T.F. Anyway - after 50 mins calls - they release the gift card.And when I asked about $ 20 credit for using wireless plan at the same address ( which was the condition ) - they said - it takes few months and the excess we paid will be refunded and the discounted rates will apply.I check in every 3 months or so and after a total of 9 months - they tell me - kid you not - I have chat transcripts , that plan is no longer available.W.T.F.ATT signs up customers who want to save money luring them into false promises and then after they are stuck with ATT - they tell you \" \" that plan is no longer available \" \" .I am not surprised by this behavior because this was the reason I moved out of ATT network. But due to changes in employment and to save few bucks - I 'believed ' them again to be misled yet again.ATT wireless service in our area is patchy too ... I have had ZERO drop calls in years in this area but with ATT service - that 's no problem - we have miles of 'patchy service'.ATT continues its legacy ... at least they are consistent in screwing people of their hard earned money.Time to look for another service I guess . \" ",

They are going back and forth back and forth. Telling me they guarantee it 's fixed to telling me there 's no way around it. It 's making things that much worse with my mental health when they do this to me. The reason I can not access all my accounts is because I changed every account to just one password.

He did not give her a receipt as he said the credit would show up as a credit in her online bill. When after 2 months Geraldine did not see the credit , she called the store. That manager is now at a new store. The current manager told her there was no \" \" record \" \" of her iPhone 12 Pro being given to the previous store manager as a trade-in. She then called AT & T multiple times - and they also told her there was no record of her trading in her phone. They did nothing to help. Finally , \" \" Missy \" \" from AT & T said that it was up to Geraldine to prove that she gave the manager her phone and that she should file a police report.

I go online to try to pay the bill and am unable to get into my account since it is closed. I attempt to pay as a guest , no luck. I open a chat for help. They tell me that I need to call to pay. So , the next day , I call to make the payment. Of course t-mobile uses a call center somewhere outside of America and the person I speak with speaks broken English , so explaining the situation and understanding him is not ideal. He tells me I need to go onto the app to create a pin in order to verify who I am , so that I can make a payment. We go back and forth and I finally ask to speak to a manager , which he refuses to transfer me to. So even though I have my account number and am able to verify any information they need me to , they are unwilling to let me make a payment without a pin. Which is interesting since I did n't need a pin to actually create an account with new service. Makes perfect sense. So now , I will have to waste more of my time to go into the store for $ 2.50.

For someone who’s out of the house a lot and needs mobile data to be able to carry out day to day activities , this was a tremendous inconvenience.Customer service online did some trouble shooting , with no success. They advised me to go to a local Vodafone shop so the SIM card could be changed… Right around that time , however , I had to travel overseas which meant 3 weeks of continued inconvenience and no access to the Internet.Upon my return to the country , I swiftly visited a Vodafone shop. They couldn’t fix it , despite changing the SIM card twice. The only solution was to deactivate my number for 4 days ( imagine not having your number and people not being able to reach you ! ) while a different solution was attempted.This luckily fixed the issue but at what cost ! A complaint on my behalf was filed by the Vodafone shop service people while I was with them and today I received a call where I was offered a credit for two months as a compensation. Laughable ! Vodafone needs to try much harder to keep their customers happy , especially if they deactivate my number to fix their network issues ! I requested escalation of the complaint.In all honesty , as soon as this is sorted , I’m switching over to another provider.

Is TMobile any better ? No. Not really. But seeing as how att isnt even nessessarry , they are as cocky and putrid as should be expected. They can possibly issue refunds in 3 to 6 weeks but they cant give you back your time and effort and mental stability , not that they would even if they could. Their apps for security are depricated before you even download them , they charge for services they dont provide and they cost cut by routing all your issues as customers to non us based call support.

        "\" I 've been a TMobile customer for over 20 years , since it was Aerial , back in 1997.For more than 6 months , I 've been paying late fees because my payment due date was originally the 13th of each month and I usually make my payment when I get paid on the 15th of each month. In August , I contacted TMobile Customer Service to request my payment due date to be changed to at least the 15th of each month. For my surprise , after I was informed that the change was made , the following bill ( September ) was still reflecting the 10th as the due date for the payments. I patiently contacted TMobile Customer Service once again and supposedly , the issue was resolved , but I still had to pay the late charges. When I received the notification for the October payment , once again , the due date reflected is the 10th. I contacted TMobile again and I was given a credit so ok. I was also explained that I could schedule a payment on October 15th or 16th , as a payment arrangement , and that the November payment was to be due as requested , on or after the 15th of each month. For my surprise , and once again , I just received the notification about my bill with a due date of 11 / 10th and this time the total amount due is $ 20 higher than the last amount paid.I contacted customer service once again , this time yelling and screaming to whom identified himself as a Supervisor , Brandon , who stated that he was able to change the due date but I will still be responsible to pay the November bill on the 10th. He offered a $ 20 credit ( A JOKE , AN INSULT ) as damage control. Ridiculous.I 'm not asking for $ 20. I 'm asking to get the due date fixed. I feel it is unfair that after over 20 years of paying on time , I need to keep paying late fees due to the incompetency of the TMobile 's staff , where nobody seems to be able to make a simple change to an account. As a mortgage loan processor , I know the importance of paying on time ; however , looks like TMobile is unwilling to help in order to keep collecting late fees . \" ",

Unfortunately that was a mistake my BT broadband was slow but very stable with very low latency great for online gaming which I ca n't say about Vodafone broadband high latency and unstable connection. I 've contacted the customer service to find out what is causing high latency on my broadband and after a few tests and checks there 's no solution to this. After digging deeper I 've done a few tests and trace route my connection and it looks like my connection is being routed through Vodafone 's Scottish servers in Glasgow or Edinburgh. So my connection goes almost the length of the country across vodafone 's network , before it even meets the internet. I live near London. And there 's no solution for this ...

        "July 26 2024 my internet just went out. Tried all the reset crap 2 or 3 times. Called customer service and they sent out a technician. He said the line was broken and a new line had to be ran. After 3 no show scheduled times buried cable crew came out to bury a line that hasn’t even been laid yet. This happened 3 three different days. Finally a crew came out and ran and buried the line and left open on both ends for the technician to hook up. Two day later still nobody showed up. Every time you call and schedule a technician he never showed up. Come to find out the buried cable contractor never turned the finished ticket in. Called and scheduled a time again yesterday 8 / 19 / 24 again a no show. Called again first thing this morning and technician is supposed to show again today 8 / 20 / 24 we will see if they show today . ",

        "\" After being a customer for many years with this company , they simply do not care. I’ve been paying off a barely working IPhone for 4 years. I have to pay 99.00 to trade it in for the same obsolete model despite signing up for their buy one get one free plan years ago. Due to the fact we’ve upgraded - that was cancelled. Obviously , most people want to upgrade.The company preys on people’s desire to be trendy and in. They prey on their misfortune , and their absentminded selves. They bought Metro PCS so nope , can not go there and pay less , they bought Sprint , so now can not go there and not deal with these crazy corporate games since they are TMobile now.We need phones because it’s 2024 sadly. So we put up with it. They know this.There are never any offers local to people in the Northeast for the T-Mobile Tuesdays hardly. There are definitely no offers for loyal customers. No discounts nothing. You want that fancy new phone ? You’ll have to pay for it for 4 years in small payments and it’s a never ending high bill.I’ve had to replace my daughters phone about 7 times and pay a fee every time of a whopping 99.00. The Assurian insurance is terrible. If T mobile is such a big company , why not just walk in the store , pay the deductible and exchange phones there if we are to pay the high price ? Twice Assurian claimed they lost the old phones we sent in- threatening to charge us for not sending in the ( very broken phones ) only for many calls later to have “found” them once shown proof of tracking. It’s truly corporate greed and being treated like a number at its finest.I’ve been told “if we do this for one person we’d have to do it for everyone ! ”The reason for my final upset - I’ve fallen on hard times these last few months and can not pay my insanely expensive bill. Our phones will be shut off because they want to argue with me over the fact I can not pay the last two bills and they will get their money eventually. They are a multibillion dollar company. They make you promise to pay on a Sunday so if you get any money on Friday then it won’t be in that day. You don’t realise this. They do though.They also won’t let a relative or friend pay in the store either or let you pay with an expired ID as I don’t have money to get a new one yet.I’m a responsible person. I had a job. I ended up working for a company who replaced a higher up with a very unprofessional individual to put it nicely - and I left for my safety. I have not been able to get a job since. I’ve been living on savings and some I will get back soon. T mobile can not wait ? ? ? I have proof of this. They are a very wealthy company.This never has happened we have always paid. So clearly something personal is going on. They do not care. They should really have honoured their buy one get one on the phones too but that is not happening either because my daughter wanted to upgrade.So that’s my experience with T-Mobile and that is what happens when a company becomes a monopoly.

        "\" I joined T-mobile when it was the \" \" uncarrier \" \" under Jonh Legere. The service was n't always great , but they tried , and I wanted to support that. We were on a family plan , and after about 15 years , and as the kids aged , it made sense for us to switch to a different carrier that better fit our needs. That 's when the nightmare started.I got an letter saying that I never returned a 4G range extender that I received in 2012. Yes , 4G and 2012. It had never worked for us , so we returned it to the store at least 7 years ago. There was no indication on our account that T-Mobile still thought we had it , so I had long since lost any receipt -- it was off the account , so why hold it ? So I called T-mobile at least 10 times over 7 months. First they said they were trying to locate it , then said I 'd receive a credit since they found it. The credit had n't been issued , so I called again , at which time they said that since they had no record of it , I owed the full original price , plus a late fee , and there was no way to appeal. Remember : this was a 4G ( which is seldom used ) device that was over 12 years old and they told me that they would issue a credit ... until today. Oh , and if I did n't pay , they 'd ding my credit rating.So today I paid over $ 200 to be done forever with T-mobile. I hope other people have better experiences , and I loved \" \" old \" \" T-mobile , but I could n't recommend T-mobile of today. To say for months that I was all set , then to turn on a dime -- for a device with no value that they should have known I returned -- is ( IMO ) terrible service , so to anyone who asks , I 'd recommend trying another carrier . \" ",

        "\" Switched to Vodafone with BIG regrets. My City Fibre engineers inspected my installation to check for faults and concluded that the reason for not getting my contracted speeds was down to a faulty router which they reported back to Vodafone. They will not send out a replacement and all communications have hit a brick wall. Vodafone are in breach of their contract but dont want to know. So payments halted. Avoid ! Following their reply below , i have since installation date communicated with the store , Arte robot , various expert agents , personal managers and Twitter and have a stream of correspondants and open tickets all saying \" \" i will help and sort this for you , please stay connected \" \" when in fact every person i have engaged with apart from City Fibre who support my case , are designed to wear you down by putting up a breeze block wall and not help whatsoever. They wont listen to you or City Fibre when you simply need a replacement router ! Complete Madness , Best way is to stop paying them but even that so far hasnt worked. Better still stay clear of Vodafone you will regret it.Ok so senior complaints involved now and a very polite lady called to say a new router is on its way and offered compensation. New router is worse than the original ( kind of expected ) but now Advisors say case is closed.The penny dropped. The router i have is not faulty but simply not fit for pupose. It will never reach the contracted speeds that City Fibre advise. The idea is you are forced to upgrade and pay more but even then if i thought it would work i am sure it wouldnt with faith lost in Vodafone. Glad i didnt buy the alltogether mobile phones as well ! Refused to pay anymore and asked to be released from contract . \" ",

Got told ‘that £20 a month is for new customers only - nothing we can do , best we can do is £23 a month’Thats AWFUL - someone in product should be sacked for that - existing loyal customers should get BETTER deals than new customers to ensure retention.We’ll keep the new Sim as its working fine , but Vodafone will lose the 2 existing SimsIts high time Ofcom stepped in and just like insurance companies forced phone providers to offer existing customers the same deals as new customers on renewal ! In the mean time Vodafone product teams can should ‘read the room’ and do a lot more to ensure customer retention - there’s only so much customer services and sales can do if their hands are tied by poor deals for existing customers ! \" ",

Furthermore , I was also told that there is no timescale as to when this event will be completed and that I will continue to get no fiber until this has been done. Also , I have been offererd NO compensation or discounts as apparently you 'cant ' because there is no estimated timescales. So almost a year of broadband and I have 3 months at best.

        "\" I wish trust pilot could give me the option to leave 0 starts , WORST COMPANY EVER. They scam you , steal from you and increase prices without telling you. To after they charge you , they can tell you that they can decrease the price after they charge you more than they should. I rather die than return to ATT. I switched to another mobile company , they told me that after the numbers are transferred , the AtT service lines would be automatically cancelled. We are a family of 4. Everyone except my sister choose to not change their number , just transfer the number. We ask several times if the limes would be canceled , they did it with the 3 phones that choose to stay with the same number , but not with my sister number. My sister number was active and they were charging 77.04 for it , a line that was not being used. I HAVE TO ALSO SHARE THE HORRIBLE WAIT TIME IN THE CALLS. In companies like Spectrum the wait time is less than 3 minutes , in Att is 1 hour or more. Worst mobile service ever. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. You paid your phones , they increase the prices of the lines , and also they charge 100 dollars when you request technical support on the home internet while in T mobile , Spectrum this is free , that’s why I said that they scam you or steal from you , because that is supposed to be a free included service. No way. Dunno how they can still in the mobile business. But karma exist and justice does also exist. Why they have to be like this ? Why can’t they be a good mobile company , why choose to be evil. Me , family and even friends will never be back to this dark hole called ATT \" ",

Vodafone would only offer a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford and I mentioned 02 were offering a 3 year deal. I was told if I wasn’t happy I should go to O2 then. My phone wasn’t working properly and I wanted to keep my number and being a pensioner and disabled I needed a working phone. I told Vodafone I was leaving but again they weren’t helpful so I got a phone from O2. Vodafone said they weren’t informed and charged me for a 2 year deal which I couldn’t afford to pay. In spite of several letters , emails and phone calls Vodafone couldn’t have cared less. Only interested in making money , very poor customer service. I could only do so much , I couldn’t go to the store for help because of lockdown so what more could I have done ? I now need a loan to get my roof fixed as I’ve got water coming in and I’m losing my winter fuel allowance. I can’t get a loan as I have this so called ‘bad debt’ on my credit report .

        "\" 1. I placed an online order to trade in my existing iPhone 13 Pro Max and buy a new Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.2. The order succeeded and I received an email to pick it up at the store.3. I visited the store and the representative in Fremont , CA told me that the order was not accessible and that she needed to cancel the existing order and create a new one.4. We go ahead and cancel my online trade-in order and create a new order in the store.5. While creating the order , the representative never asked me if it was going to be a trade-in , which ideally she should have ? Anyway , the order goes through after waiting for 30 minutes and I walk out with a new phone. I am assuming I will receive a FedEx label to send my existing phone to At & T.6. 20-25 days pass and I do not receive any label or email confirmation. I call in to customer support to inquire about the shipping label. The agent tells me the order was cancelled for some reason and that he has created a new trade in request so I can walk in at any time and return the device.7. I walk in after a week ( I am a new dad ) and the lady at the store tells me that she can not accept it since I was 1 day late. Advises me to call the trade-in customer support to request for an extension.8. Sitting outside the store , I call in the trade-in customer support and they suggest that it 's not doable and that I should reach out to AT & T customer support.9. I call in the customer support and they tell me to get in touch with trade-in customer support since they can not extend it anymore.Being late by 1 day and not getting to trade in my $ 1000 iPhone turned into a horrible experience. In addition , they have added protection plans without permission increasing my bill by at least $ 30 / month. I have talked to them to remove them but still no update.Not sure what 's going on with AT & T but their service is turning into a nightmare. I will switch to another carrier along with my family and friends the moment I have paid off the phone . \" ",

        "\" I used the self-service option to request the porting of two numbers into Vodafone on the 13th and 14th of December. It has now been nearly a month , and the numbers have not been ported. To make matters worse , neither the original Vodafone numbers nor the ported-in numbers are working.I have attempted to resolve this issue through your online chat service , but the chatbot refuses to transfer me to a human agent. I have also called multiple times without success. This situation is unacceptable , and I am now considering reporting the matter to OFCOM.Vodafone has lost my numbers in the porting process , and they are now stuck somewhere in your system. This issue needs to be resolved immediately , as I will not tolerate any further delays.This matter needs to be prioritised and demand that a swift remedy is assured.Can someone respond to my complaint so that I can provide all the details to get this mess sorted.I made a big mistake choosomg to port into Vodafone. I now regret itI do n't use Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , so please provide an email address to contact you . \" ",

        "\" I tried talking to vodafone , explaining to them that I need to be free from the contract because I changed my tenancy and since they can not give me a good signal , I have to transfer to another network. I explained to them , I would not be transferring if they are able to give me a good signal. However they can only give my 1 bar signal and E for my internet. It is not in my control to have this signal , and if they can not provide it , it is only fair that they let me go. They want me to pay a termination fee which I am not happy to accept since I am not the one who has control with the signal. They should take action. They change my sim to e sim but signal is the same. After repeated calls , I am still with vodafone. I am sufferring , depress and very frustrated. I work hard to earn my money , and I want to get the worth of my money , the service that they promise to provide. But , instead , a big company like vodafone will not process my request to end with them freely and continue to make me suffer. I am now isolated from contacting my family which is my only source of strength. I am been very sad and depress and might be thinking that maybe all bad things would happen to me eventually. I don’t understand why vodafone is so greedy and won’t let me go. This happened since 1st November and they have not taken action. They don’t care. They just want your money ! I hope you are happy to waste my money. I hope you are happy to contribute further to my depression. I just hope whoever owns this company , this comes back to you a hundred fold. I hope you get so rich than you are now and still be unhappy ! \" ",

That was a lie along with a credit that was issued it just disappeared along with my trade in amount for my old phone. I’ve been with them for 23 plus years I’ve always had several lines but with my recent experience I will be changing companies completely after the current phone that was supposed to be free is paid off.If there is a lawsuit against this issue with them I’d like to join in what they are doing to customers is not legal at all. PLEASE DONT USE T-MOBILE . ",

Received text and UPS tracking notification that the phone had arrived at the store and was ready for pickup. I get to the store location and was told they don’t have the phone but they can see the transaction on my account. My only option is to wait in limbo while they “do an investigation.” In the mean time the money I paid can’t be refunded and I can’t upgrade my phone or do anything until they complete their investigation. No one can tell me how long it will take or what their process involves. There is no one higher up I can speak with and nothing else they can do. I was told by the store sales person they usually don’t allow shipping to stores because this has happened before. If this is an issue why would it be an option at all. They know I don’t have the phone but someone signed for it at the store or a nearby business. Store claims the person who signed is not an employee there. I get the need to investigate but why hold me in limbo for who knows how long when they clearly know I don’t have the phone. Do better T-mobile ! ! ",

        "\" I was disconnected three times before being able to complete my support request with a T-Mobile representative. I inquired about an additional T-Mobile line of service for a new SyncUp Tracker. I told the representative I was calling to find out what promotions were available. The representative said if I ordered a new line of service , I would receive a new SyncUp Tracker for free. She specifically and unequivocally assured me the device would not be part of any T-Mobile financing agreement. She asked for my credit card to pay the sales tax charge. I provided her with my credit card information. The T-Mobile agent said she would email me an e-signature to sign so she could ship out the device. When the e-signature form arrived , it carried a 24-month finance agreement. I was extremely suspicious and asked the representative to explain. The representative told me , in no uncertain terms , not to worry about it. The representative said the e-signature form was the only form T-Mobile had at the time. The T-Mobile agent said that once the device shipped , the agreement would be cancelled , and I would receive the device for free , without any financing and without having to stay with T-Mobile for 24 months. I signed the agreement , knowing I had the buyer 's remorse period as protection. The agent gave me her personal guarantee that I would get a free tracker without the financing agreement. After my phone with the T-Mobile agent , I called T-Mobile and spoke with several representatives as well as a billing supervisor. Each T-Mobile representative said I entered into a financing agreement. None of the subsequent agents or supervisors I spoke with about this incident cared about the fact that a T-Mobile agent had defrauded me. All anyone from T-Mobile had to do was listen to the recorded conversation I had with the dishonorable T-Mobile agent , and it would be clear that the agent deliberately lied to me.I made multiple requests to have the representative I spoke with call me back. I never received a call . \" ",

        "\" I want to share my recent experience with your customer service team when I called 08080034515.The first time I called , a woman answered and asked me to hold while she checked some information , but the call got disconnected. I waited for her to call back , but she didn’t.I called again , and this time a man picked up. Me as a non-native English speaker , I found his speech very fast and unclear. To make things worse , there was a lot of background noise—people laughing and chatting—which didn’t sound professional at all. When I couldn’t understand what he said , I asked him to repeat it , but he still spoke quickly. then I asked if he could slow down , and he sighed loudly , which felt very rude. whats your problem ? I told him that if he didn’t want to help me , he could ask another colleague to take over. Instead , he left me on the line without saying anything , and I could still hear the noisy background. When I tried asking if he was there , he didn’t respond. After a while , I was suddenly put on hold with music playing.I had my recording with this ! do you want to hear how you treat your customers like that ? This is truly the first time I have encountered such service even in other countries or other customer services , with absolutely no basic respect at all.Is this how your company treats customers ? I’ve always had a good impression of Vodafone—the staff in stores and the online chat team have been polite and helpful—but this was a terrible experience. I can’t imagine how an elderly customer or someone else who isn’t fluent in English would feel in this situation. It’s not unreasonable to ask someone to speak more clearly or repeat themselves when the background is noisy.Thankfully , my third call was a completely different experience. A different woman answered , and she was so patient and polite. She spoke clearly , and there was no background noise at all. She listened carefully and helped me solve my problem. I really appreciate her professionalism and effort. If every customer service agent were like her , this company would be so much better.I hope you take this feedback seriously. Bad service like the second call can drive loyal customers away , but good service like the third call makes people want to stay.Thank you . \" ",

        "\" In November 2023 , I ordered broadband , received the kit , booked an installation date , and then ... nothing. No contact from the provider on the scheduled Friday. I called them on Monday , only to be told my order had been canceled because they could n't actually provide broadband in my area. I filed a complaint , but it didn’t get resolved.Then in April 2024 , I received an email about possible compensation. After spending hours in chat , I was told I wasn’t eligible for compensation after all. Later , I was informed I could claim compensation , but only for a few days. They blamed it on an automated system sending out emails indiscriminately. Here’s the kicker : I was marked as an inactive user at the time , so either someone made a mistake , or the system has serious issues ( Skynet vibes ? ) .The irony ? My neighbor in the terraced house next door has no problem ordering broadband , but every time I check for mine , it’s unavailable. After spending two more hours in chat , bouncing between departments , I got nowhere. My next step is OFCOM—at this point , Vodafone owes me around £2,000 in compensation . \" ",

        "\" Left us 7 days without broadband , and provided around 200mbs of speed while we are paying for 900mbs ! ! ! The customer service we engaged with after installation kept lying to us about what will happen and that someone is working on the issue , instead it became apparent that they were simply hoping it will resolve itself.We first waited the 24 hours for internet to switch on. nothing. then 1st call they told us actually its 48 hours. nothing. 2nd call ok they tried something to fix it we need to wait another 24hours. nothing. then 3rd call same just give it couple hours. I persisted kept asking for update. nothing day 5 I started recording their conversations and said I would publish this to show people how rubbish they are. I even called the cityfibre who installed it. first got some headway with them they told me the status of the line , that its not them because the connection to the home is valid , but the Vodafone have not ACTIVATED it. its the router basically. Vodafone denied it. when threatened with recording and more they still persisted I have to wait and wait and wait. keep resetting router each time. nothing new. finally after a week of waiting the internet finally came on.We were some tired from that ordeal that we did not want to go to someone else , but now after 9 months of experience we should have. Internet is on 95 % of the time , but sometimes randomly resets. looses connection despite router being on. this is annoying as I work from home and can be on a call with someone or you are watching a movie and it just cuts off have to wait 5 minutes for it to come back.Last straw was when I checked the speed just now. I was checking it few times throughout the 9 months and it was NEVER higher than 400mbs where they promised 450mbs minimum and the speed actually should be 900mbs. today it was 180 - 220 mbs.My ping in games is 40 at best , usually 60. that is appalling level of broadband. I had better ping when had 15 mbs broadband 15 years ago.I am connecting to the router directly with fibre internet cable to my PC. so the measurement is as close to the broadband speed as can be . \" ",

        "\" Okay , going to take a moment to vent and to save anyone else the grief. First of all I have ATT as my wireless provider and my internet provider. Well , a couple months ago we were having issues with our phones and we took them to the ATT Store in Valpo. They were awesome. They fixed her phone and found us some \" \" savings \" \" on our account. I have n't really seen much of that but that 's not the point. They also convinced us to with to switch to their internet air by offering a considerable discount. While I was n't thrilled to switch to internet by air for my home internet , they had a trial period and the discount was substantial enough to make me try it. Well , the end of the trial came and the service was , in a word , eh , but just as good as what I had so with the promised discount , I determined worth it. Well , one month went by and the discounted rate was not applied. Two months , three months , still nothing. Finally I called to ask where the discounted rate was. After about 20 minutes , the apologized and stated that the discount did not apply since we were already an ATT internet customer. I explained and asked why did they think I would switch if the discount did n't apply since I had their service already ? After about 20 minutes I was promised that they would honor the agreement made in store and apply the discount retroactive ... ... Problem solved , right ? Nope. Two months later still no discount. I call again. Same story , no discount since I was a current customer. Again , I asked why would I have switched then if I was n't promised a discount. Surprisingly they had no answer. This time however , after waiting 30 minutes on hold , I was told that I need to go back to the store and talk to them but they will not be giving me a discount on that service. So basically ATT lied to me twice. I informed them that I will not be returning to the store. I will be taking my overpriced wireless accounts and my home internet to another provider so the only contact they will get from me is how to return this egg. So , the moral of the story. If you have ATT , be aware they do not care about their customers and if you do n't , LOOK ELSEWHERE. Their service is n't that great and their company is a bunch of liars that will say anything to get you off the phone. Oh , and I have been on a waiting list for well over a year for Fiber interned and still no closer. Good thing at this point . \" ",

        "\" Chose to switch to Vodafone from BT. Fibre broadband provided by City Fibre. Initial date was 16th Dec 2024. There was an issue with installing the fibre from my home to the cabinet due to a ducting fault outside my home. City Fibre ( I have a separate review from them ) said the fault would be fixed in a day or so. Did n't happen and when I contacted , I was told by City Fibre the date would be 7th Jan. Vodafone were aware of this via City Fibre but omitted to inform me. City Fibre although not a customer facing organisation did in fact provide me with this information via a real person - not Vodafone 's extremely poor TOBi thing : ( On 7th Jan , nothing had happened and I contacted City Fibre again to be told the new date was 10th Feb. Again Vodafone knew but simply did n't let me know. I wrote a negative review of City Fibre and they came today ( 16th Jan 2025 ) and seemed to have resolved the issue.Later today I received a message from BT that my service would be stopping. The Vodafone router still had not synced and had no internet. So I 'm in a position where I could lose my working BT Broadband and have no Vodafone Broadband. Remarkably bad. Why turn off a working system when the replacement has not been verified. BT dropped this evening at 10pm , but a reboot seems to have brought it back for now - I 'm using it to write this.So this \" \" One touch switch \" \" is worse than doing it yourself as at least that way you know you wo n't be without an important broadband connection.Oh , to use TOBi effectively , you need a PIN. You ca n't set the pin unless you activate your online account , which you ca n't do if the service is n't live. I 'd love to see the test plan for that feature set. At least today , the third time I spoke to an adviser , I was told that they could set a PIN for me. Third time lucky.I look forward to Vodafone 's response : ) \" ",

I consistently had a single bar , the spinning wheel of death , a minimum of 40 minutes wait time and up to 4.5 hours on hold with customer service. The promise to buy your phone is ONLY on paper. You actually get nothing for a trade in. I was also promised $ 150 in Sam’s club gift cards. I never saw them. I had to pay $ 700 to purchase my phone so I could get a better carrier for more than 1 / 2 the cost and far superior service. AVOID TMOBILE ! ! ! ! \" ",

On the scheduled date , two engineers from CityFibre arrived , but they encountered a blockage in the underground duct running from the internet distribution box on the corner of a nearby street to the front of my house. As a result , they could not pass the fiber cable through. They assured me that a team would return within a week to resolve the issue.Since then , both Vodafone and CityFibre—who were very attentive and communicative up until that point—have seemingly disappeared. Despite contacting customer services via phone and written communication , and even reaching out on social media , my issue remains unresolved.I want to stress that no one has come to address the issue since November 22. Please refrain from saying , \" \" Our team has looked into this , \" \" unless there is concrete evidence of action.I work from home , and this delay has caused significant disruptions to my professional life. If this issue can be resolved , I urge you to take immediate steps to fix it. I also request a clear , concrete explanation regarding the situation.If this problem can not be resolved , please inform me transparently so I can cancel my subscription and explore other options.Thank you ! \" ",

        "\" If you want the too long do n't want to read. Do not use T Mobile. They are a terrible company. Pay the extra 10-15 a month per line for a real telecom provider.T Mobile as a company is simply not in compliane with Federal Trade Communication guidelines and generally does not adhear to business practices set by the local Chambers of Commerce for each and every region within the United States they operate.I decided to try out the service , it bare functioned. The modem died , I tried to get it repaired. They added to much friction to that process and actively refused to repair the T Mobile 5G modem. Come today. I have a $ 500 USD bill for services not rendered as they were keeping the account running for what appears to be 6 months even though it 's a month to month contract ( auto renew without consent is against several FTC guidelines and policies ) . They made it very difficult if not impossible to cancel my account. They 've designed so that you have to call them and they spend 30 minutes trying to keep you as a customer. I 'm sure I cancelled the account in the past but here it is.I called today to see if they could make it right. They made course of action except to pay the debt collection agency. Their service was sub par and quite frankly it was a terrible experience overall. If you operate an Authorized T-Mobile reseller or repair center. Quite frankly I would find a more honest company. The negative karma you 're generating working for T-Mobile will come back to haunt you.A final note. To any open source projects such as OpenStack or any other project managed by the CNCF or OpenInfra Foundation. Please do not accept code commits from a company which does not operate ethically and within the guidelines of what I believe are pretty normal business practices. Their customer service personal are trained to \" \" handle \" \" customers , they are not trained to resolve issues . \" ",

I was told that the Openreach connection on the pole outside had n't been activated . Having spoken to Vodafone they are telling me the earliest Openreach can look at this is the 5th December. I now have no phone line or broadband. Despite informing Vodafone I have a daughter who has a disability and it is essential I am able to contact her. They said there is nothing they can do. My mobile phone does not work from my home 90 % of the time. So I do n't really know what to do. I did ask Vodafone if they could supply a dongle but they said no. Given I was bombarded with text messages regarding the installation I would have thought Vodafone would have checked there was a viable connection in place.Order number : WEB-0001000041337817Messaged Vodafone as requested.Nothing they can do .

        "\" We had T-Mobile internet service for 19 months. The T-Mobile service at the beginning was pretty good , with the service freezing needing a restart only about once a week. However , the towards the end in August of 2023 , the gateway ( modem ) needed to be restarted several times a day in order to function. Around the same time T-Mobile removed the $ 5 discount for auto pay if you were using a credit card. Something they had allowed for over a year. On Aug 23rd we ordered Xfinity. The Xfinity gateway would be delivered in several days. On Aug 24th , 2023 I called customer service and told them I wished to cancel. However , customer service said I needed to try a new gateway first to see if that would correct the problem. I figured I would compare them both. T-Mobile sent a replacement quickly , but it did not do much better with Mbps download of 44. The Xfinity gateway came a few days later with Mbps in the 400 's for downloads without any problems. I canceled T-Mobile service on Sept 2 , 23 through their customer service. When canceling they requested the 6 digit number that I gave them when I signed up 19 months earlier. I gave them the number I had written down in my T-Mobile file. The customer service rep said it was the wrong number. I said that is the one I uses. They said it was imperative that I give them the 6-digit code. I asked if they could use my soc sec number or email me a reset and they said no. They said that I would have to physically go to a T-Mobile store and request my 6-digit number after they verified my identity. I drove to the nearest store located at 2024 IL-50 Ste A1 , Bourbonnais IL 60914 and spoke with a rep named Michael. He said he could not give me the 6-digit number and told me to call customer service back and tell them so. I went home and called and told them what he said , and they said okay and that they would email a return label for the gateway. I received the email with the label on September 2nd , 2023 and returned the gateway to UPS. T-Mobile received the gateway on Sept 11 23. I received a letter stating that \" \" They received the gateway , and no further action is needed on your part. \" \" Then on Sept 19 , 23 T-Mobile collected an auto pay of $ 55 from my credit card on file. I called my credit card to dispute the charge. T-Mobile sent me a new bill asking for the $ 55 , plus $ 25 for a chargeback , Plus the next months $ 55 for a total of $ 135. I called customer service on Oct 7 , 23 , and they said I needed to go to an actual store because they could not help me again because of the 6-digit pin saying the one I gave them was incorrect. I went to the store in Bradley Il and they told me that the account had never been canceled , even though customer service sent the return label and had received the gateway. The store contacted T-mobile customer service from their store and eventually a very rude corporate manager named Patrick said that they insisted I pay the full $ 135. I explained I had cancelled the service on Sept 2 , 23 and returned the gateway. He said it was T-Mobiles ' policy to have you also physically come to the store to cancel and that it was n't officially canceled until that day which was over a month later. I told him I physically went to the T-Mobile store but Michael would not give me the pin. He scolded me saying I should have used the phrase \" \" I wish to have you cancel my account \" \" I explained that I had already done that with customer service rep on the phone and that I had told Michael that I needed the pin number for them to cancel it. Patrick from Corporate says that I am repeating myself and it was my fault for not saying that I wanted Michael to cancel the account. He then said that he would offer me a one-time deal that he would forgive the last months charge and that he was being very gracious in doing so. I again told him I did n't even have a gateway to use the service and that T-Mobile had it after sending me the return email and label. He again said it was never fully canceled to their satisfaction whatever that means. We went round and round until I said I would pay $ 55 for the month I disputed even though I had canceled the service just to end the madness. He said he also insisted on the $ 25. I said no and that I wanted to only pay $ 55 only on that day. He said it would cost an additional $ 10 to have an operator take my payment. I asked if I could do it online without a charge and he said yes but it would not give me a confirmation. Because he was not helpful at all we ended the call. I went home and paid $ 55 online and still received a confirmation number. It seemed that Patrick was trying to squeeze even more money from me. The amount of time and effort I have put into resolving this is ridicules. There appears to be no training for customer service either at the store level or at corporate.Update 10 / 15 / 23 T-Mobile reached out and we reached a mutual understanding . \" ",

        "\" I am writing to formally raise a complaint about the exceptionally poor service I have received , particularly from the Milton Keynes branch , as a loyal Vodafone customer of 10 years. The series of issues I have faced over the past several months has been incredibly frustrating , time-consuming , and ultimately unresolved.I initially began experiencing service issues in August 2024 , when I had no access to my phone for two weeks. Due to work commitments in a different city , I was unable to address the issue immediately. Upon returning , I visited the MK branch , where I was told that the problem was caused by an old SIM card. However , despite the fact that the account is in my name and the phone belongs to me , I was informed that no action could be taken because my father pays for the service. My father , who is 68 years old and suffers from dementia , Parkinson’s , and poor mobility , is unable to leave the house easily. Even after explaining this , the staff at the MK branch offered no apology or assistance , and I was sent away without a resolution.The following week , I had no choice but to bring my father into the store in a wheelchair to update the account and receive a new SIM card , which should have been done in the first place. This issue was somewhat resolved for a short period , but in December 2024 , my service dropped once again , this time for a more extended period.On December 28 , 2024 , my service dropped again and did not return. I returned to the MK branch , where I was told that the issue was hardware-related , not the SIM card. I was assured by both Sunny and another store manager that I would not incur any charges for repairs , and it was suggested that I return in the new year to send off the phone for repairs , as this would be quicker.I returned on January 7 , 2025 , to send the phone off for repair. I was assisted by Avril , who seemed unsure of the process and stated that she \" \" wasn’t very good at this. \" \" After some assistance from the store manager , I was informed that my warranty had expired just a week prior to my visit. I inquired if there was any possibility of disputing the repair charges , as I had previously visited the store within my warranty period , and was assured by Sunny that everything would be handled , and I should not worry. However , the interaction felt rushed and dismissive , especially as the store was nearing closing time.On January 17 , 2025 , I received my phone back in the mail , still broken , along with a letter stating that the repair could not be completed due to the warranty expiry. The letter also mentioned that they had attempted to contact me , but I have not received any emails or messages regarding this matter. This is entirely unacceptable. I am now left without a working phone and still being billed for the service.I am deeply dissatisfied with the entire process , the lack of communication , and the ongoing inconvenience this has caused. I have invested a significant amount of time visiting the store , engaging in live chats , and speaking on the phone , only to be left with no resolution and no confidence in the repair process. I was assured multiple times that this issue would be resolved , but I am now at square one , with no solution in sight.As part of the resolution to this matter , I would appreciate a full refund for the two-week period in August 2024 when I had no access to my phone , as was initially promised. Additionally , I request that this issue be escalated to ensure a proper resolution , including repair or replacement of my phone at no cost , given the ongoing nature of the problem and the significant delays caused by Vodafone 's lack of communication and support.Please consider this letter a formal complaint. If this matter is not resolved promptly , I will be forced to take further action , including escalating the complaint to the relevant regulatory bodies. Should this issue be resolved , please be assured that I will be discontinuing my relationship with Vodafone after 10 years of service.I look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely , Chloe MayockAnthony Mayock \" ",

Vodafone has a separate app for broadband which enables customers to manage their home broadband from their mobile device and then an app for the other services ( mobile , mobile broadband ) for account management. When I renewed my mobile phone subscription with them , they amalgamated my billing. What seems to have happened is that they then disassociated the broadband from the main account ( although they still bill me for it ) . When I tried to find answers online , their chatbot was n't working and the answers in the community forum with any useful information had all been deleted by Vodafone. These are literally the only way that you can get in contact with Vodafone through the Vodafone website or app. I ended up trawling through social media to try to find an account of theirs and found one on Twitter ( X ) - on that , there is a message for Vodafone UK saying that you can direct message them for help . They have literally disabled their website and are relying on a third party social media platform to run their help desk , for those customers who have n't lost the will to live by the time they reach it. The help function they run via X is on a turn based system , so someone responds to you and then you do n't hear anything for minutes at a time as they help other people. It 's the most inefficient and ineffectual help system I 've ever come across , and I used to be a BT customer so I 've experienced some pretty terrible helpdesks. It 's unbelievable . \" ",

Vodafone just replied with the exact same reply as three weeks ago.Probably not written by a real person. Just AI standard response.Pathetic really . ",

Called support and was told that promotion no longer exists but they can give me $ 15 off a month from that date forward and they would issue a ( 6 / 18 / 2024 ) $ 100 reward card to compensate me for the extra $ 120 charges on my past 6 bills.

So today is 8 / 29 / 24 and I call to ask what is going on with the rewards cards supposedly being mailed and was told even though I never received $ 50 rewards card they would not issue a new one and that my $ 100 rewards card should be able to be claimed 8 weeks after approval and that that was still 2 weeks away. Now my math skills are pretty decent so I replied 6 / 18 - 8 / 29 is around 10 weeks.

        "\" Shambles of a company ! I contacted Vodafone on their drive for getting full fibre broadband business. They checked to see if my postcode and address were compatible and offered a great deal that I couldn’t refuse. They said they would contact my current provider ( BT ) to cancel and all I had to do was wait 3 weeks for the arranged date. A week later the router arrived , no problem. Next week I got a text to tell me that they couldn’t get hold of BT to cancel so I should do it myself. Did that and arranged cancellation for 10th of December ( Vodafone were meant to instal the fibre on 25th Nov ) , this took me about an hour between being on hold and answering questions so thanks to both BT and Vodafone for that one. A few days before the instal date , I got another text to say that due to complications with citifibre , there was an issue and they couldn’t make that date. The fix was on the 28th nov and Vodafone would contact me then to re arrange the instal date. I mentioned to them the cancellation date with BT so everything needed to be in for then. No problem they said.No call on the 28th and then on the 4th of December I received a text from citifibre and Vodafone to simply say my order had been cancelled. After waiting an age on their hold I got through to them for them to blame everything on citifibre and take no responsibility and say I was cancelled and had to deal with it myself. They’re weren’t interested in discussing any further and only gave me some useless and meaningless apologies. I had to call BT and start a new contract which of course leaves me cut off for a week between cancel date and new start date. Cheers Vodafone you useless bunch of liars . \" ",

I found out My 83 year old MIL was being charged for T-Mobile $ 130 / month for half a year for a phone she had cancelled. I tried multiple times to stop the withdrawals from her bank account but they refused to stop billing her because she “couldn’t remember her passcode.” The bank claimed they can not cancel those monthly debits direct from account. They said we’d need to contact the debitor and disturbingly said that T-mobile wasn’t good about complying , I.e. they are scammers. T mobile eventually said she could cancel by going into the store. By the time I saw my MIL over holidays and took her to store to cancel , she was prob out $ 600 which they wouldn’t refund. What a bull $ & @ t company . \" ",

        "\" I paid off my phone and I switched my service to a new company. I asked T Moblie to unlock my phone multiple times but it is locked for the second week. First time I called I spent 40 minutes on the phone with the T Mobile they told me that the phone is not purchased via T-Mobile so they would not unlock it. I explained that T-Mobile sold me the phone and I used to pay monthly to T Mobile for this phone. She replied that since the phone is not from T-Moble she can not help me to unlock it. I had to explain again that I have all the paperwork in front of me showing that it was purchased from T-Mobile and in each bill it is stated that I paid for the phone with a final balance to be paid. She asked me to do some resetting and try to unlock it but with no result. Finally I was informed that I would get an email , and the matter would be taken care of by the technical department and the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. I did not get any email and after 4 days the phone was not unlocked.Next time I called I spent 80 minutes on the line with T Mobile going through settings on my phone and mostly waiting on line. The lady told me that the phone was not used so it can not be unlocked. I explained that I have been using the phone for a year. She replied : “since the phone was not used the phone can not be unlocked” I had to repeat that I just said that I was using the phone for a year. And so on , and so on. Finally she said that the phone will be unlocked for sure this time in 24 hours. But nothing happened. We talked 2 days later and went thru the settings and I was told that the phone will be unlocked in 24 hours. It wasn't. I called 2 days later and I spent 2 hours on the phone with one lady and next another gentleman. Finally he asked me to go to the T-Mobile store. I explained that I already did go to the store but they said they don’t handle unlocking the phones and I have to call T-Mobile. But he explained that I need to go to another location so I did go to find the same reply , “we don’t handle the unlocking of phones , please call T-Mobile . \" ",

I went ahead assuming it was T-Mobile at the time , but it turned out to be '3 ' Mobile and I did n't realise they had sold my details until I read about it , and being naive about mobile phone companies , I thought that '3 ' were part of T-mobile. I only found out about the data being sold by reading about it in the papers at the time. Needless to say I have n't used T-mobile nor '3 ' mobile ever since. However , we are now in 2023 and I 'm still receiving scam and spam emails from all the usual culprits at the rate of some 15-20 a day. It is so brazen that they always quote a reference number and guess what ? It is is the last 9 digits of that original T-Mobile number I had so there is no escaping who is to blame. Beware they will sell your personal details ! Also '3 ' Mobile need a mention too as they bought those stolen details , so do n't trust them either. I 've left this for so long but after all this time I 've finally had enough and the fallout from a company that still drags on. Someone less aware will get stung no doubt further by the scam emails proliferation. I would have liked to have given no stars to both those companies \" ",

        "\" The worst customer service experience of my life ! ! ! ! Long story short I received a notification about an outstanding balance on my device plan on the 10 / 1 / 2025 which paid immediately.After I 'd made the payment and contacted Vodafone , they advised me after 20 +minutes going through the same information that the payment would take 24 hours to update.However , on 16 January 2025 , my phone service was barred. Despite 13 attempts to contact the free customer service number , being left on hold and also having the phone disconnected by Vodafone , the issue remained unresolved.The customer service team said I 'd failed to pay the outstanding balance of £21.00 even though I have photographic evidence ( screenshots from my banking app ) that I offered to email them. Said customer service advisors informed me that Vodafone do n't have an email address ? ? ? Unlikely do n't you think ? I told one of the customer service advisors that my mental health has severely been affected by this as I have been going through a very difficult time at the moment , due to being in temporary employment and the added pressures of the financial impact this has had on me. I have ADHD and its proven very difficult to find a permanent role.To which I was greeted with radio silence from the advisor and a very patronising and uninterested tone. They do say if you want a job doing do it yourself and so I spent yesterday afternoon having to visit my bank for payment details and then a Vodafone store to resolve the issue , because the customer service advisors left me on hold. The whole situation caused me to leave work early because the stress and constant pressure made it impossible to concentrate at work and as a result I lost 4 hours pay.If I had n't visited my bank or the Vodafone store yesterday , my phone would most likely still be blocked due to no fault of my own.The lack of empathy , professionalism and respect is absolutely disgraceful and I dread to think how many customers have to put up with this.I 'm lucky that I have the support of friends and family , but for customers who are alone , and in severe mental or financial difficulty , an experience like this could really drive them to despair. I got a robotic , lacklustre response to my complaint with £10 Compensation against my next bill ! Such an insult. I 'm looking forward to July 2025 when my contract ends and I can leave Vodafone for good.Absolutely shocking service , received and to be penalised for actually paying your bill is beyond a joke. I would avoid Vodafone at all costs ! ! \" ",

Our connection line now seems to have a block on it so we can’t even take out Broadband with another company. Which is made even harder with no telephone line or internet. Told I would receive compensation but only if I stayed with Vodafone… ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? Last review told me contact Vodafone via Facebook to discuss which has just wasted more time.

I requested to have the bills combined into one so that I do n't have to pay two separate bills every month. This rep was so poorly trained that he did not even know he had cancelled my home internet altogether. I noticed my home internet not working during our char conversation and mentioned that to him , even tried to resonate with him. I said something like \" \" is there ay chance you accidentially cliccked something that could have caused my internet issue ? \" \" He said no. Then he connected me to another rep who had me reset my gateway but service was still not restored. Then I got transferred to the third rep andfinally service was restored. Altogether I spent 3 hours chatting with AT & T all just to combine my two bills into one. Now my service is restored but God only knows if my accounts have been combined as I originally chatted with AT & T to accomplish. If I had n't JUST cancelled with my previous home internet provider and paid early termination fees , I PROMISE I would cancel with AT & T. The gross negligence and complete lack of training is incredibly frustrating. This is NOT the first rep 's fault. This is the first rep 's manager 's fault. The rep should be trained enough to at least recognize when he cancels a customer 's service. It would be a cherry on top if he were trained to not cancel the service altogether.

Six months of contact with numerous ATT representatives and the harassment continues though at the end of each contact ATT admits that the error is on their end and it will be fixed through their fraud department. Only days later to receive contact from the fraud department telling us it is not an issue for them and we should contact customer service. That cycle has occurred through eight calls…many last over an hour. In our experience it is the ATT Fraud Department that is a fraud. Beware ! Beware ! Beware ! ATT Wireless says all the right things to draw you in but provides absolutely no support once you have accepted their “service.” And we use the word service with quotes because there is not any helpful service from their end .

        "\" Email these folks and pack their inbox : nicolet.macikanycz @ att dot com and john.stankey @ att dot comThey are the executive leaders who care little about their customers after being shown numerous screenshots of an in-home salesperson who lied and deceived and made promises on discounts which did n't even exist. Maybe if enough disgruntled people let the leaders know they will actually do something.I would never use any AT & T service ever. In my lifetime they are the worst for customer service.This is what I sent them ... .I signed up for internet in Knoxville , Tennessee for my son approximately three weeks ago. While getting the internet installed , an AT & T Sr. Associate In-home Expert ( Jay S*** ) came to sell me AT & T mobile services. I told Jay S*** , I was not interested in converting to AT & T , but he was determined. Mr. S*** asked about my current mobile bill and said if anyone in my family was in the military or healthcare industry. I told him my daughter was a nurse and he replied it would be a significantly better deal than what I was receiving through Verizon. He also explained if I purchased an AARP account , I would receive an additional discount stacked on the healthcare discount. He also said AARP provides insurance for phones of up to four claims a year so there is no need for me to purchase additional insurance through AT & T.Mr. S*** promised me a rate of $ 127.26 plus taxes for six lines with three phones ported over and three lines with trade-ins of iphone 13 to iphone 15 with all discounts applied and three upgraded phones. I have witnesses to attest the following as well as text snapshots from his AT & T work phone to show what was promised to me. I will attach a few of the text pictures to this e-mail. Mr. S*** also claimed I could get the combined ( wireless and internet ) discount as long as my daughter and I used the same address - I explicitly asked if our names being on the accounts being different would pose an issue to which he said no ( text shot attached ) . NOW , here is the issue , I get a monthly bill for $ 330 with none of the promised discounts. In addition , he said I would receive $ 880 in trade-in phone credits but in reality I received $ 570. Also , on my bill today he applied phone insurance to my account and the option for yearly upgrades. Which I did not ask for or approve. It appears Mr. S*** was stacking options to help with his commissions as adding this makes no sense since he said previously the insurance was n't needed with AARP. As I stated , he said AARP would cover the four claims a year , but now I found today it doesn't.I was misled on numerous fronts. I spent over four hours the Saturday after Thanksgiving on different phone calls between wireless reps , wireless managers , wireless retention reps , internet customer service and an internet customer service manager.Being so frustrated with all the blatant misrepresentations , I tried to get my original phones back and cancel AT & T. Now I am told from AT & T phone representatives it is impossible to receive my phones back. So , if I cancel with AT & T I have no phones to trade in elsewhere. Obviously , this ordeal is costing me a significant amount of time and money. Mr. S*** claims are a clear violation of customer service ethics. I have been materially financially penalized due to Mr. S*** blatant misrepresentations of the truth.I hope to find a viable solution to the egregious behavior of an AT & T employee which led to me switching from Verizon to AT & T. Between the loss of my mobile phones and owing $ 1600 for the outstanding balance to my phones and the all the time trying to rectify this situation , I respectfully request AT & T to bundle the internet and cellular account with the 20 % discount that was originally promised to me. In addition a $ 2000 credit to be applied to the account for the increase in plan costs and insurance for phones from what was promised to me. If this can be accomplished , I would commit to stay with AT & T , not post the detrimental communications sent to me by a representative of the Company and not pursue other means which would certainly be more costly to the company.Please see the attached commitments in the screen shots from Mr. S***.I appreciate your time looking into this matter and look forward to your response . \" ",

After speaking with C.S. and the manager James Soriano they opted to not honor their employee 's word.This is rough as we are forced to use this company due to coverage for home use. Its also painful to hear the staff and management ask us to call other people to fix this issue and all we got was another person passing the blame with no good results.Furthermore , each time I 've walked in , staff was too busy to acknowledge me even if I was the only one in the store. Yesterday I had to watch Neisha walk around for 10 mins before she helped me and I felt like it was a problem that I was there.The issue here is their word is not been good with us now on 2 different occasions.It 's not about the money here.

        "Went into the Blackburn Vodaphone shop in the Mall was put off straight away not one employee made eye contact or welcomed you into store very rude. There was no clear area people were queuing when I asked for help I was looked at like an alien zero customer service. I had been told to go into the store by Vodaphone online to collect sim cards for two contracts which we had not received in the official order. The whole thing was a shambles and the way in which we where dealt with was rude and unhelpful. Due to this we have now cancelled both contracts and would not use Vodaphone again. Good luck to any using this store unless they get further training in how to deal with customers & make customers feel welcome your best ging else where. There was a elderly gentleman in their on his own I felt sorry for him I could see he was n't getting anywhere and they did n't want to go the extra mile to help him. The staff member looked as confused as he did I it was like no one knew what they were doing. I was told I would have to call Vodaphone to order the sims to be posted to our home address yet I was in the Blackburn Vodaphone shop. They told me its separate ! ! Mind blowing . ",

        "\" On August 28th I went to the store in Gastonia on Cox road to find out if the phone I needed was available. As it was not , I went to the store on Myrtle School road in Gastonia. The representative , Jordan , was with other clients. I was not greeted. While still working with another client , Jordan asked me how she could help. I explained that I was looking specifically for Samsung s24 ultra with 512 GB of memory and came to her as it was unavailable at Cox road store. She informed me that she had two phones available at that location. I chose the color of the phone. She proceeded with the trade-in. As she was still working with both me and another person , I had to do all the installation on my new phone without her help. She did not go over any policies , protection plan options which she just added without asking me. When I got home and started setting up my phone I found out that she sold me a Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra with 256 GB. The next day I went back to the store. She said that she would not be able to replace the phone. She was not able to make a return either. I spent 3 and 1 / 2 hours at the store with her trying to help both me and another client at the same time again. I ended up leaving the store because she was not able to solve my issue and she sent me away. I had to go to the corporate store on Cox road where all my problems were solved by another representative without any issues. However I did have to still pay the restocking fee which I find unfair. On top of everything , Jordan was smelling strongly of marijuana , she was dressed yesterday in a mini skirt and today in jeans with multiple holes in them , something weird on her head , and looked completely unrepresentable and unprofessional. at one point I had to sit down because the smell of marijuana was that strong . \" ",

        "\" This company is HORRIBLE. Practically STOLE money from me and my family. I was using t-mobile for over 10 years and was a loyal customer. Never missed 1 payment. However , they would do some sketchy things with my bill that had Me question the company’s credibility over the last few years I was with them.Initially , I wouldn’t check my bill statements and this was a mistake because T-Mobile would charge me for things that I never used or purchased. When I would call customer service , they would lie and say I did purchase ( a plan , an equipment etc ) , but I know that I never had purchased anything additional. When I would ask them to remove those things , they would confirm over the phone verbally that they would be removed from my plan- months would go by , they would remove it initially and then it will be added on again. I was the sole authorized user on my account and so no one else had access to make any changes to my plans.After a few years of dealing with this , and having to stay with T-Mobile because I was under a phone contract for two years , I finally decided to leave. However , when I left , guess what happened ? They charged me for an additional month , AFTER , I left because I had left my card on file before closing my account. When I transferred my number to another company T-Mobile automatically removed my access to all of my files , to my online account - everything , so I could not remove any of my personal information since they took my account away ! So , I tried disputing the charge and they gave me an excuse that they had to charge me because I never paid the first month of service… what ? Whatever , I couldn’t get my money back….. But then , two months later , they sent me another bill saying I owed an equipment I never returned from back in 2016. I was STUNNED ! I never purchased the equipment they said I had purchased in-store , I also never saw this “charge” on ANY of my bills throughout my time with the company.I was so certain I was done with T-Mobile and then they send me to collections ? ? I had done EVERYTHING to avoid this prior to leaving. I went to the store , closed my account , received verbal and physical confirmation that everything was paid for and I received the last three month invoices to confirm it. Yet they still found a way to send me to collections for something I have no record or recollection of ? How the hell do they get away with this fraudulent behavior ? I’m not the only person I know that they have done this with. I am so upset ! I will never use T-Mobile again ! ! I will never recommend them to anyone. They’re over priced , and they are fraudulent ! ! Once you’re ready to leave them , that’s when they want to make things even worse for you financially.Don’t ever use T-Mobile ! ! Mint Mobile has been amazing for me. I live in NYC and it works JUST like , if not better than T-Mobile service. I pay 35 $ a month and I have no unexpected fees.Now time for me to fight with collections over this T-Mobile bill …. Wish me luck. ( Written by Rafael B . ) \" ",

I pay $ 140.00 for two phones , now with my new different wireless provider I pay $ 130.00 for 4 phones. Thank you AT & T ! And my internet cost went down also ! I would like to thank the awful service techs , and support staff for saving me money. Without your attention to do nothing , I would have never changed my phone , my internet , and my family’s phone and internet ! \" ",

        "\" I was a loyal Vodafone customer for two years , even though the signal occasionally dropped during Microsoft Teams meetings at work. I decided to upgrade to a 500MB plan because of an offer , but the signal worsened , dropping out even more during work hours. Frustrated , I cancelled within the 14-day cooling-off period.When I spoke to an advisor , I was told my contract would revert to my original one , set to end on December 12th. However , upon calling Vodafone to cancel as I’m joining EE , I discovered I allegedly owe £225 because , during the downgrade , Vodafone placed me on a new 2-year contract without informing me.I waited 30 minutes to speak to customer service today , requesting they review the recorded phone call where I downgraded. The advisor clearly made a mistake , and now I’m being falsely accused of taking out a new contract and trying to avoid paying for it.Vodafone , your service has been poor. I’ve included my order number so you can review my account notes and see how many times I’ve contacted you about issues. It’s unacceptable to place me in a new contract without explaining terms and conditions. This is a blatant error and breach of consumer law. Please resolve this immediately . \" ",

They told me they would check. I called today and the lady I spoke with was rude and condescending and said you arent going to get credit for something you arent paying for. I told her cancel my service and hung up. She called back and I said I have nothing left to say to you she said i cant cancel your service if you hang up.

My son’s phone was not letting him make or receive calls or text with the data service only with Wi-Fi. My husband has been to a T-mobile store and has talked to several T-mobile representatives on the phone to rectify this issue. Long story short… the phone is still not fixed but we still get a full bill every month for four phones and can only use three. If that’s not stealing I don’t know what is. Your job is to provide customers with service and satisfaction we have received neither for two months. As a parent it is vital for me to be able to contact and communicate with my child through our cell phones. This company has stressed my entire family out behind this one issue that an entire company can’t seem to resolve. I will wholeheartedly be in the market for a new and more trustworthy cell phone carrier immediately . ",

He explicitly stated that our monthly bill included a fee for \" \" Anytime Upgrades \" \" and that we had accrued extra credit , making our trades entirely free. Fast forward to now , and I’m trying to ship back our old phones only to discover that there is no shipping label as promised.When I logged into our AT & T account , I was shocked to find that we are being charged full price for the new phones— $ 38 a month for each of the six phones over 36 months ! This is nothing short of a scam. Vanardo 's statements were clear , and I demand that AT & T review the recorded call , where all of this misinformation is documented.I spoke with a supervisor ( MYLENE ) who offered no real help. She claimed she couldn’t access the call transcript but assured me that once they do , the evidence of Vanardo’s promises will be undeniable. It’s infuriating to know that the company I’ve trusted for two decades is engaging in such deceptive practices.AT & T needs to take responsibility for this situation. I expect a full review of this case , a reversal of these charges , and a proper resolution. This is unacceptable , and I will not stand for being misled by your representatives. If AT & T does not take liability for this situation , I will be forced to take my business elsewhere after 20 years . \" ",

        "\" TMobile Home internet service is simply Horrific. The last time I experienced internet this awful was when internet first became a thing. The Buffering , Freezing and weak to no signal when it rains MEANS JUST GIVE UP. There is no savings when you are paying for frustration. No matter how many times I contacted TMobile to complain about these issues , none of their fixes , or suggestions were a remedy. I ended up tolerating this bad service for six months , at which point I could adequately afford to change providers. The worst part is ; I cancelled my service on 9 / 02 / 24 and was told I would still be billed for the whole month of September because my bill closing date was 25 days away. Then I was told that I would also be responsible for a final bill in October. TMobile should have been paying me for all the times I called for support , because the service was randomly available .and at a level where it was useful to all members of the family \" ",

I ca n't even make calls at my own house without the WIFI. On top of that , every time I try to contact customer service It 's super sketchy and I never actually get solutions. I am quitting today because I have n't had service for over a week and I 've talked to three different people about the situation all gave me the same resolution. It would work for about an hour and then my service would be blocked again. I have never been as upset at any company as much as I am with T Mobile. All they do is take your money and cause issues.

When the monitor tells me it is offline I can not connect my browser to the internet and my streaming TV picture locks up. This is a running problem for over 7 months. I get so tired of their canned menu driven troubleshooting process - I have rebooted my router over 100 times to no avail. They replaced it three times since last December but I still have issues. I bought a new computer to eliminate my equipment as the cause. I replaced all my ethernet wiring with cat 6e. Still have this problem. No alternative available due to some agreement the neighborhood developer made with AT & T so they are the only provider allowed here.

November 15th , I call up just to ask some details only for them to tell me my order was cancelled the day before however I had not been told , if I had n't called I would probably be waiting on installation day only for nobody to show up. Apparently they ca n't even schedule for a new installation until the previous tenant is out , ca n't we schedule things in advance this day and age. They then tell you to wait until the previous tenant moves out before even scheduling the new install and by the way then you need to wait 2 weeks for installation , what , to turn a service on ? So I wait until November 23rd after the previous tenant moves out and has their service with vodafone terminated , make my order , receive an installation date of December 10th , great. December 3rd , I call , ask if we ca n't speed things up as the previous tenant also had Vodafone full fibre service and I even have my own equipment , why ca n't I plug it in and they activate my service. Nope , not possible , they want to send engineers out to dig up the garden and lay more fibre lines which was just already done for the previous tenant , oh , and at the same time I am told \" \" things on the back end somehow got turned around and we have n't even scheduled your installation \" \" so now it 's been put back to the 16th. If I had not called in on the 3rd would I now be waiting around on the 10th only to then be told installation would be around the 24th ie two weeks out. Not only this but I have had issues with account creation and because so many things went wrong I will also miss out on the £75 voucher during sign up. What a joke , I have had service installations all around the world and never anything like this , and you get told sorry sorry sorry but the only solution is that your installation gets pushed more and more back. I just moved into a new place and need internet to buy furniture , set up smart devices etc but sorry , just wait a few more weeks. My expectations at this point is they will mess up the scheduling again and I 'll be lucky to get installed before new year.December 7th Update.The previous agent who placed my new order on December 3rd for installation on the 16th had promised to call me back and update me on the order status , I never heard from them.Here we are on December 7th , I call in , how is the status of my order I ask , \" \" oh sir , it 's ben cancelled \" \" , are you serious , why , who cancelled it and did n't even bother to notify me ? New agent , we can place the order again , new installation date earliest available is December 19th ... I wish I could give negative stars , this is the most disgusting level of service I have had in my 45 years on this planet from any provider on any continent I have lived.January 2nd 2025 Update.6 weeks after initial contact and countless calls and promises and guess what , still no installation , even promises from so called supervisors / customer support specialists to keep track of your order to make sure it completes and keep you informed , guess what , no order completed and you do n't hear from them unless you call them and then you get the usual so sorry but not really sorry garbage.I am out ... . \" ",

        "\" ATT customer is the ABSOLUTE worst that I have ever encountered. I own a business and if my customer service was as bad as ATT I would be out of business. An ATT representative disabled my ATT.net email while trying to make another change three days ago. So far I have spoken with literally 17 customer service reps , chatted online with 5 , and visited my regions ATT corporate store. And after spending HOURS AND HOURS ON HOLD , have not received one bit of assistance in fixing the problem. Went back to the corporate store today and complained to a manager ( the assistant store manager - Jonesboro , AR ) about the horrible customer service. His reply was that if I didn’t like the service to go somewhere else. After three days of this…I AM BEYOND READY TO CHANGE CARRIERS ! ! ! ! I need access to my email NOW ! ! ! ! \" ",

        "Well let’s start with the fact that I’ve had T-Mobile for quite sometime and yet they decided to screw me over with international calls. I went overseas for work for 2 months. My phone was on WiFi calling I made sure and this isn’t my first time overseas doing this. They told me I had $ 434 charges in international calls and I argued with them but unfortunately they sent it to collections. So my advice to anyone is to steer clear of Tmobile and as a veteran I do not recommend them. Money hungry companies like this need to be shut down and they need to be held accountable for destroying peoples credit. Funny how phone companies don’t boost your credit yet they can destroy your credit… Seems fair . ",

Then , just as we were about done , the chat just disconnected. No message , no error. Just nothing , Reloaded the screen , only for a chat to start all over again. TOBi is pretty retarded , asking the same circuitous questions ... Eventually , I got connected to a new agent. I asked if I could be transferred back to the previous agent and was told they could n't do that. Had to answer all the security questions all over again ( despite being logged in to the account at this point ! ) Long story short , the new agent said I 'd have to start the whole process again , verify my ID , provide all my details , do a credit check , etc. At this point , I just said , \" \" No , thank you. \" \" By this point , I had been trying to sign up for broadband for three hours , and I reached my limit.

        "\" My phone line installation through BT was cancelled without Vodafone telling me. Stayed in for the appointment , nothing. Called Vodafone to see why , there had been an issue with the switch ; again they made no attempt to contact me to resolve the issue or to cancel the appointment. I complained and had to start the entire process again. Because I had originally done this through a 3rd party reward ( £125 gift card ) I lost the incentive due to it being 3rd party and not available anymore. I complained as I had to wait another 4-6 weeks for the installation process. This was brought forward thankfully and I was advised they would provide compensation for the troubles ; never happened.After a few months calls began to appear on our bill. We have no landlines phone , never plugged one in and never made a single call. Yet all they would say is they 're \" \" legitimate \" \" calls. The first manager who dealt with this ( in June ) was excellent. Sorted out the charges and at my request but a call bar on the line to stop further charges appearing. Every month since we have been charged with calls , no one is taking my complaint seriously. They just like to point out all the \" \" charges \" \" of hundreds that are against our landlines. I 've been in touch with the fraud team , line has not been hacked , so nothing else is worth investigating. I am always refused when I ask to speak to someone other then the basic call agent. It always has to be a callback upto 24 hours later. I 'm refused when I ask to speak to complaints , I ask the issue to be escalated and still nothing. Today I even had an agent tell me that you can not bar landlines to stop calls being made and refused to let me speak about the complaint to anyone else.The agent even told me there was nothing I could do , no external governing bodies even denying a ombudsman could be used. He denied everything until I mentioned CISAS and then still refused me the chance to speak to anyone else and I 'd have to wait 24 hours.6 months of the same issue and I 'm treated like this ? Congratulations Vodafone for not helping me at all**Update**Interesting how they have been in touch so much since I put my complaint into the sphere. After speaking to different people , none of which told me they had cancelled my contract , they have resolved the charges but then the complaints team told me it was cancelled and that they could not restore it , even though their mistakes caused the whole problem. If I wanted it back I would have to go through the whole process from the beginning to start a new contract. Utterly ridiculous , why would I be willing to start a new contract after all this ? Gone to Plus net , cheaper , quicker and no phone line which take this whole issue out of the equation . \" ",

        "HorribleWe haven’t even been with them a month & I want to leave which I would if it wouldn’t effect credit. I will only list a few things 1st they lied in store we switched over from our another company which we liked only reason we switched was due to the in store customer service at location near us. ( ( I regret leaving now ) they offered us a great deal on phones watches etc the one watch they did not have at the moment gentlemen helping us said come back Thursday ( was Tuesday we were there ) offer will still be good we can override the fee u will get watch for same price which was $ 26 so we got the one went back Thursday get to the second watch all of a sudden things changed can’t do it wanted well over $ 100 which I would of if they said that but I was pissed and they should of honored it like they said so I left annoyed.So that was that then they still set watch up and had linked to our phone yet never received watch was a biotch to get that corrected couldn’t do it in the store ( of course ) and customer service kept telling us it was in the mail was not understanding we didn’t get the watch it was not being sent etc. u can tell they r reading a script and have no real knowledge of anything majority of the time. so I should of known that the bad taste was going to continue to linger. I feel the service is horrible got new iphone 1 / 2 stuff don’t work can’t connect. I had a refurbished older version iPhone and had way better connection before . I would not recommend this company to anyone I heard so many bad things since this company has been out I stayed away due to that reason for many years. We decided give it a try plus they lured us in with the great deal should of stayed away big mistake. Like I said hasn’t even been a full month and on top of all this I’m paying almost $ 200 a month more to be miserable and in happy with service and not being able to use all the functions cause connection blows. If thinking about switching please do yourself a favor don’t. I never write reviews ever but I had to if this helps even 1 person. Don’t make same mistake cause I’m stuck now. I wish I could give it a positive one i at the moment have not one positive thing to say except they are good liars . ",

        "\" As of today , 10-19-2024 , I had another disappointing experience at the AT & T store located at 2510 S Telegraph Road , Bloomfield Hills , MI 48302 , involving the manager , Jon. I traded in my iPhone 13 as part of the $ 700 off promotion on the iPhone 16. After setting up my new phone , I asked Jon to show me the promotion details on AT & T 's website , citing a past issue where I did n't receive my full credit for three phones at this location. The manager , Forrest Hughes , handled the two phones in 2022. Jon refused to assist me , stating it was n't his job , and became very dismissive. When I handed him my phone to help find the information , he attempted to navigate the AT & T website for about a minute but could n't locate the details. At this point , he threw my phone on the table and rudely told me that my previous bad experiences were due to \" \" bad people \" \" who did n't represent AT & T.Fortunately , another employee , Aayan , stepped in and found the trade-in information within one minute. Aayan was polite and professional throughout the interaction , which starkly contrasted with Jon 's rude behavior . \" ",

        "\" WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER and BILL INCREASED DRASTICALLY with no explanation. I called Customer Service to sit on hold for 17 minutes and then \" \" try \" \" and speak with the person who could barely speak English. I was trying to resolve an issue from the previous month when I called and was told it was \" \" all fixed now. \" \" SURPRISE , still messed up. All these representatives do is keep saying \" \" please hold , \" \" \" \" I am sorry about your experience but rest assured I will assist you , \" \" and when you tell them that the information you were provided the last time you called and they are now saying \" \" I am sorry that is wrong but I will assist you , \" \" and you get completely different information. I have been with AT & T for over 10 years and the past couple of years their customer service is AWFUL ! ! ! ! ! Ca n't speak English clearly to understand , have NO IDEA what they are saying and information they are providing , and everyone tells you something different ! ! My elderly parents and my aunt are also with AT & T and unfortunately I have tried to assist both of them the past few weeks and also had horrible experiences ( not to mention the phone calls both lasted over an hour and a half ) ! I have already switched to Verizon ( as of yesterday ) and I will be assisting my parents and aunt leave AT & T this weekend. Hard to believe that about 5 years ago I actually wrote another review for AT & T giving them 5 stars and talking about how they were one of the \" \" few companies left who still truly believed in good customer service ; and although the outcome of my conversation was n't exactly what I hoped for , the customer service representative was polite , knowledgeable , and took the time to explain everything to me. \" \" What happened AT & T ? ? ? ? ? \" ",

Went to customer support online , over the phone , two different stores and answer was the always the same - \" \" Im sorry we are not able to cancel this service without passcode \" \" ( and thats after I provided all possible IDs - passport , SSN , driver license ) . So I decided to just remove my payment method from that NEWER USED service and guess what - ATT contacted me for no payments and threaten they will go to collectors.P.S Recommendations to ATT managers ( PMs , TPMs , etc ) : learn the \" \" breaking glass scenario \" \" and implement it !

They have admitted it was their mistake but have now said they can not get us up and running again until the 31st December which is 3 weeks away ! We live in a house with very low signal so we are unable to data hotspot and 2 people work permanently from home. I am absolutely appalled that there is nothing they can do to reactivate our account or fast track us to a new account when it was their mistake and they are leaving us in a position with no wifi for 3 weeks over Christmas. Absolutely no customer service or consideration for their customers to rectify this issue which was their own mistake to start with , beyond disappointed , stay away from this company . \" ",

The network is unreliable , with constant signal drops and slow speeds , making it impossible to use my phone for even basic tasks. As for customer service , it 's a nightmare—endless waiting times , unhelpful staff , and no resolution to any issue , making fun of you when you mention about offers from other providers.It 's as if they do n't care once you 're locked into their contract.On top of that , their prices are way too high for the poor service they offer. Honestly , you 'd expect premium service for what you 're paying , but all you get is frustration.Avoid Vodafone if you can—they force you into long contracts with no way out unless you want to pay extortionate fees. You 're better off looking elsewhere for better service at a more reasonable price ! \" ",

At this point I had to walk away from their services because I simply couldn’t afford to pay. This was for use of my phone when I was briefly on holiday. They then proceeded to pursue me for a debt of £1891.05 for unpaid charges. This amounted to a total of £4,799.12 of charges over 30 months which worked out at £159.97 per month. This legalised theft has since been regulated although there are still ex customers like me still being pursued through the high court for these ridiculous charges. Needless to say , Vodafone do not care about you as an individual and are only interested in exploiting you for monetary gain. I strongly recommend that customers do not sign up with Vodafone . \" ",

        "\" Three times I encountered this TMoble Rep from Westfield Topanga Mall , Los Angeles , Ca and the experience was just rude and traumatic. The first experience was a roughly a year ago. I came in the shop and he was standing by the door. I inquired about upgrading my phone and he was impolite and sounded not interested to help me , he simply said , \" \" ok choose your phone in the displays \" \" and did not even offer to open my account. I dismissed the experience and went out of the shop discourage about pursuing my intention to upgrade. I never forget his face. then almost a year later I went back with my wife to ask about the status of our account ( how much we pay monthly , are we eligible for upgrade etc ) the first thing he said to me was \" \" you do n't know how much you pay on your bill ? sounding sarcastic and irritated that i requested him to open my account. I let that experience go because i was tired and in a hurry. the third encounter with AJ was today Nov 17 , 2024. Two hours ago. And it was horrible. We came in with the intention to upgrade our phones. He opened our account and told us that we need to pay our overdue bill first. We were surprised of the unpaid bill because we thought we are on auto debit. But he said sarcastically \" \" No you have n't paid last month 's bill \" \" . that what it means by \" \" overdue \" \" sounding like we do n't understand what the word means. So this finally into me and reacted with all the bottled feelings i have had in the previous two encounters. I told him this is the 3rd he has been rude to us and he accused me of making up stories and of raising my voice. And he said he has the right to refuse service and told us to leave in front of all the customers. He is a liability to your brand. The lady representative who was beside us was not helpful either. I know the shop is closing for the day but that is no reason to be horrible to the customer. This experience is not acceptable . \" ",

I was told the cancelation would not take effect until January 16 , 2025. I argued that cancelation should take immediate effect , but to no avail. What a scam ! This is their way of getting another full month of paid service despite the fact that I wo n't be using it from Dec 26th to when the cancelation takes effect on January 16th.

Explained why I called. Told her all the information she needed to prove I am legit , including order number etc. Asking for pin number again , what pin number ( ? ) which I don’t have. Then told me I did not pass the security check. I asked which questions I failed and was told the info I gave didn’t match. What info ? Told me a link in a rush which I had to clarify repeatedly. Requested to speak to their supervisor but was told they could not help me ! ! ! ! ! ! I needed to go to reset my security details when I haven’t even registered in the first place.I went to the website she recommended , guess what. Same thing happened…. “The security code you entered doesn’t match what we have sent. Please enter it exactly as it appears in the text.”I have just done that ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Look like I have to visit a Vodafone branch IN PERSON to sort this out. I have never used such a lousy app and customer services like Vodafone. Also I can not use just the mobile phone to register without a computer as when I came out the app to retrieve the code , when I went back its back to square one , going round and round the circle but was unable to complete it.
