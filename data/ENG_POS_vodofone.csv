"Joey was fantastic! She was incredibly helpfuland knowledgeable when I was purchasing my new Pixel 9 Pro XL.  Not only did she patiently answer all my questions and make sure I got exactly what I needed, but she also helped me save money in the process by finding the best deals and promotions. If you're looking for a top-notch salesperson who truly cares about their customers, ask for Joey!",2

"Mirza was fantastic with all information, guided me very well and I trust his information.He made things clear so I can understand (brain issue) and helped me understand a few things with my phone that I was confused with ..I'm very pleased 😀 to what I thought would be a nightmare to navigate he made it a pleasant experience",2
"Invaluable assistance and knowledge sharing from both Aman and Khurram today in helping me resolve a few security issues. But they got me set up very quickly and helped with my apps so no information lost in swapping back over from Giffgaff. My only small peeve was that I was given the net and not the monthly VAT incl price of the plan which was a bit naughty. But they stayed and helped me back up my phone before the move, so really very happy overall. The service was excellent, very professional and helpful. Cannot recommend enough. You get what you pay for, and I am happy to be paying a bit more for better security.",2
"An experience good enough to write a review.Bilaal took his time to go over a number of different options with me, gave future proofing advice and would highlight the package I most needed, not trying to upsell me on everything but still letting me know what the other, more and less expensive options there were.Price ranges were similar between a bunch of places but the service is why I'm now a customer. Thank you for the informative and patient assistance",2
"Always a pleasure going to Vodafone Elgin and seeing the staff there such as Rennie, Katie, Agnieszka and Dan  who are always helpful and willing to help. Such a shame it's closing due to the center it's in closing, hopefully a new premises is opened soon in Elgin.",2

"Well what can I say. Graham at the store in Pontypridd was absolutely outstanding. Went out of his way to solve a problem that wasn’t really his to sort. It was an issue Voxi had created but his passion for great customer service meant that he would not let us leave without getting a solution, despite not being able to verbally talk to anyone on the Voxi team. He spent an absolute age on the webchat with them and finally got the problem escalated to a senior team member who was able to look into how it could be resolved. Good old fashioned customer service is what any customer wants and every shop should have a Graham.",2
"Buddy from The Webchat TeamBuddy was absolutely amazing, helped me with saving money on my contract, and also adding an iPad onto my contract, helped me with every question that I had, and made everything really easy to understand.

"I needed Vodafone to save me, with 2 weeks left before a big fat 6 months abroad I needed someone to navigate all the phone things I never had the brain to memorise. A Puc vs a Nuc code? What the best deals were to be able to spend data abroad, how to transfer My account to my name from my mums when I was 13. Joshua in the bracknell store was an absolute life saver,  we burdened him with many specific requests and he navigated them all easily and knowledgeably.If you're stuck with phone problems this is this store for you, man went and saved me from years worth of failed robot phone calls, and I no longer have to wait for My retired mother to join me in store to access My account. Wins all around.I'm very satisfied and now very comfortable I never need to know what a NUC or PUC is again, I can simply rely on josh.10/10",2
"I was just shopping with my girlfriend around Oxford Street, and I got my phone stolen at the busy crossroads. I then wanted to get a replacement, and Piotr helped me out straight away!

"I cannot praise Alexei enough for his outstanding service at the Vodafone Winchester store this morning. He was incredibly helpful in assisting me with switching from a different provider to an excellent SIM-only deal with Vodafone.Thanks to Alexei, I now have a £10-a-month plan with 40GB of data, unlimited calls, and texts. I’m absolutely delighted!I did notice a member of staff sitting down who was engrossed in his phone, which some recent reviews have also mentioned. While I understand staff may use their phones for work-related purposes, I would suggest that when a customer enters the store, staff should immediately disengage from their phones, stand up, and warmly welcome them.That said, my experience with Alexei was exceptional. He was professional, patient, and genuinely helpful in making sure I got the best deal. I cannot fault the service I received—thank you,",2

Josh originally helped me get the best phone deal & made a note of it for me to take while I looked in the other phone shops for other offers.It turned out Vodafone was the cheapest so I went back.Jack helped me buy & set up the Google pixel phone for me.It wasn't the easiest to do as my old phone was completely broken & couldn't get my PAC number sent to my old phone.so he found a spare phone to put my old pin in so we did it that way.It took ages to sort as the EE phone line was busy & they had to keep putting me onto other people to help.Jack was very patient & made sure I got everything I needed.He even made a note of steps I needed to make with my new phone when I got home.Josh & jack really did go above & beyond for me.Excellent customer service.Id definitely go into the vodafone in at Stephens again amazing staff,2

"It's just over 2 months since I switched to Vodafone broadband. They kept me informed prior to the change, on the day the Openreach engineer ( actually a subcontractor from Kelly Communications) was on time, he was polite and friendly, and the new service was up and running before he even left the house. Vodafone even phoned me the following day to check that everything was alright, I was impressed with that.Since then I have been enjoying faultless broadband with only the very occasional couple of seconds dropout, and a constant speed, currently 72.19 Mbps on Ookla (which shows slower speeds than other speed test sites). This is quite adequate for me and it is in fact faster then I got from BT / EE who were ripping me off for double Vodafone's monthly price. I am currently typing this on my laptop in the lounge, the router is upstairs in an office.My only niggle, and it is a very minor one, is that I don't receive any email notification when each month's payment is taken, I have to remember to log in to my online account to see them.",2

Mubs was great sorted my phone out straight away no fuss even helped me out with my broadband thanks again,2
Recently upgraded from 100mbps full fibre broadband to 500mbps pro 2. Then found out shortcomings of 6ghz system that Vodafone Ultra router uses. Firstly 6e signal travels shorter distances and has trouble penetrating walls. Unless the router is near your devices or multiple boosters are used this will be a problem. Secondly not all devices can use anything above 5ghz so the supa dupa 6ghz will be a waste of money.Now my experince with Vodafone when I tried to change to 500mbps using my existing router. Vodafone TOBI chatline is useless. Even contacting a humanoid after 40 minutes he was still asking questions he asked in first five minutes. I gave up and phoned customer services. What a difference. Spoke to a lady called Meghan who immediately understood what I wanted and set  up new package with no prolems.Please note . With the pro 2 package Vodafone send out Apple 4k tv 3rd generation and a cat5 Lan cable. Both are obsolete.Netflix no longer supports Apple tv 3rd gen and cat 6 is recommended for home use5 star rating only due to the excellent customer service from Meghan and the good renewal price I got as an existing customer,2

"Thank you, Tanuja, for your help in the technical department. I hope your manager gives you the credit you deserve.The buying process was simple and easy—exactly what we like. There was no upselling or badgering, just a straightforward website or, if preferred, a webchat to ensure you got what you needed—no more, no less. 10/10 for that.Regarding delivery, I was regularly emailed and texted to ensure I was aware of my router delivery. It arrived at my old address, and the setup date coincided with my move-in date. When I moved in, the first thing I did was plug in my router, and voilà, I had broadband! Sending the hardware to a safe location and allowing me to handle the setup was a great approach.Once set up, I immediately connected the 2.4GHz network to my smart devices. My laptop, phone, iPad, my wife's laptop, phone, iPad, and approximately 15-20 smart devices—including lightbulbs and sockets—were up and running in no time. This had no impact on speed, and the network analyser provided a clear picture of what was happening.The app and web interface make BT look like child's play. Vodafone provides access to everything a network engineer could want, all within an app. This makes troubleshooting devices and connections so much easier. 10/10 for this, Vodafone—you’ve stolen my heart.The web interface is equally impressive—simple and easy to use while delivering information rapidly. Want to see your network visualised with fancy graphs? Check out the analyser! Want to know what devices are connected to which band? You can see that too! Need to set up a second network just for your gaming PC? Be my guest—it takes half the time compared to the BT interface.Now, the bit you’ve all been waiting for—speed. I was told I would get a maximum of 65Mbps, and I consistently get 65Mbps on all devices, no matter where I am (with one exception, which I’ll cover later). I can be in the bath watching tech videos, in the living room watching tech videos, or even on the moon (theoretically), watching tech videos—all in 4K with perfect audio and no buffering. The speed they promise is the speed you get.Of course, Vodafone uses OpenReach's infrastructure (I believe), so your speed should be the same as your last provider unless you're with Virgin, who run their own infrastructure. The real difference lies in Vodafone's hardware—and this is where I hit a small bump in the road.My fancy desktop PC sits in my office, 10 metres from the router, in a flat with thick walls. Everything else in the office works perfectly—smart lights, phone, MacBook—but my PC failed to connect. Despite having a PCIe network card capable of finding both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, it couldn't detect my Vodafone network. After an excellent webchat with Tanuja, we determined the issue was simply the connection between my PC and the router. Moving the PC was suggested… but come on, Vodafone, you want me to set up my desk on the stairs? While I appreciate Tanuja was following protocol, I politely declined and temporarily placed the router halfway down the landing. Thirty-three seconds later, I was back online. Happy days! Now, I just need to explain to my wife why half the TV unit is sticking out of the doorway. Sadly, I don’t think Vodafone’s webchat can help with that.I do feel Vodafone should offer at least one broadband booster, relay, or extender. These devices don’t enhance speeds but extend the signal. I was told I’d need to upgrade my plan to get one of Vodafone’s plug-and-play systems, which, for me, is pointless since I already have the fastest speed OpenReach provides in my area. Why pay an extra £240 over a 24-month contract for a booster when I can buy one from TP-Link, Netgear, or Ubiquiti for £50? Vodafone should consider offering one booster per customer experiencing connectivity issues. Given that my flat isn’t that large and everything else works fine, it’s disappointing they don’t provide one without additional cost.Overall, Vodafone has won a customer for life. Thanks to their Blue Light scheme, outstanding customer service, and excellent overall experience, I’ll likely switch my mobile phone contract to them when it’s up for renewal. Well done, Vodafone!",2

"As a young man I was Rik Mayall in the Young Ones. As a pensioner I have turned into Alf Garnett. With the amount of arrogance and incompetence that I find, I've plenty to moan about.

Only a year old  will not start or play ball ... important one amongst them all. Nipped in  to Vodafone Bridge St. Worksop and in a bit of a tizz James.  James Methodically went through Security, which put my mind at ease. Then went through things explaining but Whooshter overy head. He confirmed my suspicions not immediately but calmly it's ' buggered ' no messing around went through some options BUT MOST OF ALL none,  NIL, no attempt at trying to get another mobile contract upgrade etc etc. really found James to be a Proper 100% guy, yes a salesman man but someone whom listened and treated me how I would treat people.",2
