"At my request, T-Mobile processed a suspension of my T-mobile home internet service and promised the monthly fee would be reduced from $50 to $10. As agreed, the service got suspended immediately but T-mobile continued to charge the full subscription amount of $50. When I called in again, the agent just said, sorry there was an update to our terms (= fineprint) and now when we suspend we continue to charge the full amount. Of course, this makes no sense whatsoever. Why even offer a suspension when you get charged no matter what. And not living up to the agreement is just fraudulent. Took me a lot of headaches and escalation to get the charge refunded and I just canceled my line. Goodbye T-Mobile. Never again! Current management seems to be on a mission to destroy all customer trust they once had.",0
Tried talking to customer service and am able to get anyone. Was talking to a Jay and he transferred me and no one ever came back on.  Very poor customer service I recommend do not sign up for the service as they do not stand behind anything once you sign up.  Impossible to speak with a human unless you go to a store hopefully you have 1 closer than 50 miles away.,0
"Representative MARTASHA from T-mobile lie to us so we could switch companies, she bribe us by telling us we will get new iPhones if we trade our phones, but that was a lie. We were considering switching to T-mobile, but every single representative we spoke to had lie to us and everyone said different information. We returned all the equipment they sent to us, and now they want to charge a restocking fee, even after having proof on writing what the representative offered was a lie just to get us to signed. They were so many hidden fees that doesn’t make sense, she said we will pay a certain amount a month, and ended up being wayyy more money that she told us. I should have listened to the reviews, this company has to be shut down!! What a nightmare they are.",0
Lies lies lies lies. Anything that comes out of their mouth is a lie and hidden fee you won't know about. Was due for an upgrade got a new phone and was told that it was paid off and time for upgrade so I did months later being hit with double charges for my monthly bill and come to find out they're charging me for both phones still that's crazy. Bill was 280 for no reason other then being misinformed,0
"Highly, highly highly recommend a HARD pass on Tmobile.  Their support is atrocious.  When it comes time to leave they make it brutal to reach them and do it and then they bill you for another couple of months and claim you didn't cancel.  Service is lousy. Go elsewhere - Dealt with Sam #4973207 and he truly had no ability to answer or resolve anything. Spent 2 hours the night before dealing with support person that was even less competent. There's a lot better and/or more affordable options.",0
"You can tell the people they hired are paid by the hour. The last several interactions I've had are outsourced so you can not even understand half of what is being said (and I'm in customer service and normally can) then simple what should be 5 minutes calls are put on hold for things the ""expert"" should know like 14 minutes to see how many gigs of data I used last month. Another 17 minutes on hold to tell me that I can upgrade my plan for one month for my vacation to get extra gigs. SERIOUSLY? 49 minutes for this convo- I'm traveling to mexico next week- wanted to make sure my plan covers international travel.  Her you only have 5gigs of data- me- can I buy more data?  That was the extent in entirety for 49 minutes! Not including the hour wait to talk to a tech. The people answering the phones there are just milking the clock. Or just not familiar in the slightest with where they work.",0
"They charged me for a year, 2 phone lines while I didn't have a single one! When I looked at the account, there's a random number I've never had! You'd think they'd apologize and refund me, but instead, they told me I should've checked my account! Pathetic! T-Mobile = Scammers",0
"They are a ridiculous and lying company! I made a cell phone plan and paid $127 every month for the plan, when the iPhone 16 was released they said that I could exchange the old device for the new one and I paid off the old device and got the new one and I would pay $127 dollars so I did I sent the device to them in the box that they sent me! I received 2 messages on the app saying that I had not yet sent the device and that my promotion would be canceled I called them and they informed me that it was already said that the device had already been received and that I did not need to worry 4 months would pass, I woke up my bill was $165 dollars. I went to the store to find out why, and the girl at the store told me it was because I hadn't sent the old device, so I had to cancel my contract. I had to pay $1,099 up front to keep my device, and I also lost my old device, which I had paid off because I sent it to them. People, don't sign a plan with T-Mobile, they don't honor the contract and in the end you'll lose. Look for another company. I looked and I'm satisfied with Verizon's service.",0
"Do not use these people! They of all cellular companies are the worst by far! The give you a billing date that means nothing to them if you have autopay. They claim autopay gives them the right to debit the payment 3-5 days before the due date . Why have a due date? Why not 3-5 days after the due date? They are desperate people . They will even charge you 10.00 to take the payment over the phone a day early! Their contract and word is worth nothing , just a company run by losers.",0
"This provider is a scam, cheat and a Lier.I have been with T-Mobile for several years with 3 lines, paying $105 a month which includes unlimited data.Last year they changed my plan without telling me and said it was a special offer, I ended up paying more and had to call them to revert to my original plan.I  have been in the UK for a while now, they blocked my unlimited data and roaming service, they said I was using too much data! I called them they were rude and would not restore my data and roaming service. I would give them a BIG 0 STAR if I could. I will be looking for another provider when I go back. What a big SCAM company.",0
"Representative at T'mobil made a bad mistake on 01/10/25 it was caught immediately. I called to speak to a manager,both were rude, and not helpful, I been a customer for 20 years thankfully no problems until now. The Rep was wrong, made an error, the managers admitted that but was still so rude and unprofessional.I am seeking another phone carrier.",0
"I would have to agree with the reviews that accuse T-mobile of being scammers. I found out My 83 year old MIL was being charged for T-Mobile $130/month for half a year for a phone she had cancelled. I tried multiple times to stop the withdrawals from her bank account but they refused to stop billing her because she “couldn’t remember her passcode.” The bank claimed they cannot cancel those monthly debits direct from account. They said we’d need to contact the debitor and disturbingly said that T-mobile wasn’t good about complying, I.e. they are scammers. T mobile eventually said she could cancel by going into the store. By the time I saw my MIL over holidays and took her to store to cancel, she was prob out $600 which they wouldn’t refund. What a bull$&@t company.",0
"Very very bad company! They sent me a device and when I returned it in same condition they charged me money for it saying that I damaged it! Despite the fact that it already arrived non working and damaged. And they use the fact that I cannot prove it because I took no pictures of it! Also they changed my plan without my knowledge and increased my monthly payment. Also one day I lost my internet driving in the middle of nowhere and lost my map. When I called them, they said that driver was disconnected?!!! What? So it was working before and someone disconnected it on purpose. When I asked for explanation, they couldn’t give one. But the last drop happened today. When I called the company and asked them to unlock my phone because I’m going to relatives funeral in Kiev, Ukraine, they said they would not do it because I’m on contract and it’s not up yet!! And on top of it they tried to sell me more international plans?!!! OMG. These people make money off of your pain!! STAY AWAY!",0
Negative 5 star review.   Was sold insurance and told at time of purchase of free phone replacement 4years later 20 amonth and a surprise 300 dollar for the free replacement phone.   Or I can upgrade from 300 for a worse model or 700.  Terrible scam,0
"TMobile is a scam company.  How do I know having never had an account with them?  They put a charge on my credit that I filed a fraud dispute over, but TMobile (And Transunion) refuse to examine the documents or give me the time of day.  I have 8 fraudulent bills in my file from TMobile, sent to MY house, meanwhile with the names of 7 other people on the bills.. My address.. another name.  I have sought to have Transunion consider these documents to no avail.  They are in cahoots one with the other.",0
Absolutely the worst customer service. I had a problem with my billing so I called the customer service and the woman said yes she can see there's a problem but you can't do anything with it right now. She tells me she will call me back today at 5:00 p.m. so I wait all day at home and she never calls. All they do is lie to you. They don't care if you have to pay more and all I did because I had the Netflix with ads and for $8.50 it said I could have it without the commercials so I go ahead and do it. Big mistake charges me almost $15 instead of the $8.50. So what do I do I just have to go to another phone company and get rid of T-Mobile because they don't care about that they outsource their customer service overseas where they just don't care there. They try to act nice but all you hear is noise in the background because they're all laughing having a good time. They promise you the world but when you have to make it change your account you have to go to an account specialist so you get passed on another 10-15 minutes and then they lie to you.,0
"Previously, I was prepaid only, as I didn't see the use of spending 60-90 for phone service. I needed internet, and options were limited in my area. They offered me $40 for my phone and $40 for internet. This was a lie. My bill is $120, not $80, with all of the additional fees. On top of this, I brought a perfectly unlocked phone to them, and they had the audacity to lock my phone and refuse to unlock it when I wanted to go elsewhere. Had I known they would do this, I would of never gone with them to begin with. I will be going right back to my prepaid service and use someone else for internet. These companies think they can do whatever they want to you. What right do you have to lock a phone that isn't your's? It was fully paid off. We as consumers need to stand up or continue to be controlled by these big corporations. We let them do anything to us..",0
"10,000 ZEROS! I have never, ever been more angry than I am right now. T-Mobile bills change without warning. They changed my services and added extras. I had to call them at least 10 times before I could find anyone that could or would even attempt to understand me.Hours spent talking to human robots that do not do anything to resolve problems by design. The lack of service is unecessarily abusive.They should greet you with: ""Welcome to T-Mobiles foreign-based customer torture chamber; how can we make your day more miserable? Do you enjoy repeating the same words over-and-over-and-over to barely English speaking people? Do you like being stuck in clown world vaccuum where nobody could hear you screaming? If so; T-Mobile is the place to be.That said; globalism reeks and so does T-Mobile.",0
"only put 1 star cause you have to!!  I went in to their store in Waterville to do a free up grade, granted it was time to pay my regular bill, so i expected to walk out 55$ less! We decide on the phone do all the work the whole time telling me nothing about fee's, last I knew FREE was FREE, suddenly he writes down $84 circles it and says this is what we'll pay today with tax n service, i said thats kind of high isnt it, oh wait is that including my $55 current owed, he jumped on it, and reassured me yes yes thats it! look at my bank account today and to my surprise 2 charges $55 and $84. Went back in to speak to someone they were no help jus basically told me it was fee's and taxes plus a walk in service charge, even though the phone rep told me I had to go do it at a store. So no resolve I'm no happy and will be shopping for a better place!! been dealing with them 2/3 years, no late, no complaint!!",0
"I ordered T-Mobile's home internet on October 17, 2024. Big mistake! No matter where I placed the gateway in our home, the gateway only showed one bar. What a joke! It wouldn't  provide a strong enough signal for even one of our smart TVs. Constant picture and sound lag. So I reinstated Spectrum internet. On Dec 26, I called and cancelled T-mobile. I was told the cancelation would not take effect until January 16, 2025. I argued that cancelation should take immediate effect, but to no avail. What a scam! This is their way of getting another full month of paid service despite the fact that I won't be using it from Dec 26th to when the cancelation takes effect on January 16th. This is no way for a company to earn consumer's trust and respect. Ipredict that T-Mobile's sketchy business practices will soon lead to its demise. A company just can't intentionally screw consumer's over and expect to remain in business.",0
T-Mobile Home Internet has been averaging 6-7 disconnects per day.  Calling or chatting with Support is always fun and interesting but they never have an answer other than resetting the equipment.Go with anyone else selling internet service except T-Mobile.,0
"I had Home Gateway that quit <9 mos old. Took it to T-Mobile store. It took 2 hours. They tried to give me new one as free exchange, however it would not work. So they pulled second one from back but told me it would ""cost me $11.04 because we already gave you one for free and we can't do it again"" I never had 1st new one in my hands or left store! Then they said, ""If you don't pay $11.04 then we can't give you Gateway. However, you can call T-mobile and order one for free that will come in 5 days."" I called Customer Svc in front of them and they told store ""you made a mistake and should not charge customer for second Gateway. There is a way to give it to him no-charge"" Store refused and charged me. Customer svc said they could not refund charge because of way store charged me. I called Manager who came to store. He said he would "" get refund to you in next 24 hours"". He never did. I disputed charge on my credit card. Therefore, T-Mobile added to my monthly bill, charged $15 late fee, and did not give me my autopay discount for the month. Therefore, my money bill is $40 higher this month than normal. T-Mobile is just as BAD, if not worse than Verizon, ATT, etc!!!",0
Hidden Fees for watch reactivations. And when you cancel they don't tell you they'll send you a final bill that doesn't come till a month later and they tack on more fees. I was forced to pay my bill late. Terrible service and hard to cancel.11558051198,0
"I have been a loyal customer with T-Mobile for over eight years always paid on time never had an issue with their billing. I tried to pay off a phone. The customer service representative told me the amount that I needed to close the account which never happened the phone remained locked, which I had already paid for And they charged me for two more months of service which they could see that I hadn’t used one minute of that service I called three separate times to be lied to to say it was taken care of and then I get a collection letter. I have a credit rating That is more important to me than paying them off.. And there’s no way I’m gonna let a hack job like T-Mobile screw it up so I paid them off again, but believe me I’m leaving bad reviews on every site that I see.It’s not worth your time your money and your sanity to join this cell phone company. Their service sucks and I’m talking about cell service too.",0
This is the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.  They sold me internet that never worked and never told me any time during a full month of tech calls and hours of my time that what they sold me would never work.  No internet for a month and gipted me out of a $200 rebate.  I warn anyone considering using T-Mobile internet to steer away.,0
"Tried to cancel internet before they sent me the modem. Told me I had to wait 24 hours but it would be cancelled and ""rest assured It would be cancelled and I wouldn't be charged"". Ended up on hold for 30mins the next day trying to make sure it's cancelled before I gave up. They sent it anyway. Now I need to figure out how to return this thing without being charged. It's ridiculous.",0
Just awful shop staff are incompetent changed my plan without telling me . Customer service the worst I have ever experienced took 9 days and close to 10hrs to restore my plan  plus charged me more than double the original plan cost !Phone service was great store  staff the worst and customer service the worst,0
"Review of T-Mobile Home Internet 15-Day Test DriveService Start: I began the 15-day trial with T-Mobile Home Internet in November. Initially, the service was poor, but after some adjustments, it significantly improved. I was impressed with the speed and quality of the service, to the point where I considered switching my lines from Xfinity to T-Mobile. However, due to the complexity of the process, I decided to cancel.Cancellation Process: I spoke with customer service, and they recommended canceling within the 15-day period, which I did. I received a return label for the equipment and sent it back before the deadline.Subsequent Issues: On November 29, I received a letter from the collections department for $55 with no explanation. I never received a bill from T-Mobile for this amount. Then, on December 9, 2024, I received another letter from a collection agency in PA for the same $55. Finally, on December 14, I received a bill for $32.66 for internet usage, despite having returned the equipment on time.Reflection: I am referring this case to the consumer protection department in the state of Oregon for review. It is concerning that a large company like T-Mobile uses tactics like these without following proper procedures. I hope that with advances in artificial intelligence, new companies with better services and more transparent practices will emerge, eliminating the need to deal with situations like this.",0
"We have had nothing but problems- dropping connectivity- had extra mesh installed, can't use or upload photos for work. The customer support is foreign and appears to read from a script/ is not a help. Multiple calls to customer support where they have an attitude. They ask the same questions over and over without logging the information or history. Cannot play video games etc- we lose internet continuously. After about a month , a different customer support said they would have continuous connectivity with our tower ( shouldn't it be already?) They say the same thing about the towers...And still the same issues again and again. Every time we call they ask the same questions wasting 20 or 30 minutes at a time like, our address, phone numbers etc...we have gotten hung up on or dropped from calls just to do it again. Once we have the opportunity we are changing our service to another company.After our call just today 3 January 2025 the lady finally admitted we were too far from our tower- so everyone else before knew that and kept taking our money. We only got one 1/2 of a month refund after complaining our faces off and now we finally know what the real issue is after 3 months! Apparently we are supposed to ""call back if we have continuous problems from here further"" Ridiculous and dishonest for them to obviously k own we wouldn't have connectivity where we are yet they allowed us to sign up. Total waste of time.",0
Got scammed. Internet did not work. Customer service is extremely lame. Store employees do not have authority,0
Thank you so much to all of you who took the time to share your negative experiences with us I appreciate it.  Because of the reviews and not one response from TMobile I have decided to go with another carrier.  So many reasons why I couldn't trust them ever I would say.  Happy Holidays.  Best.,0
"T mobile service is 💯 Horrible in my location ,, they promised last 4 years no worry we will have your service back working ,, unstable connection means never completely connecting to internet thus sucking data non stop.... they changed my contract from 100 gb to 50 but tells me it was always 50gb....what a big lie...",0
"I would give ""0"" if I could.  I am not complaining about the service across the country, although much improvement is necessary even on Interstates Freeways.  Instead, I am complaining about false advertisements for deals and rates.  As a senior citizen I chose to go with T-Mobile for its over 55 rates and I also chose to upgrade our phones because we were long overdue for new phones.  We went through Costco because not only were they giving $400 dollars per trade-in for each of our phones, but a Costco gift card on top of that (which they did). One year and seven months later, we are still paying for the phones, and it turns out to be FULL PRICE without the $400 trade-in. Their Customer Service is useless because I called about the bill within the first six months, and they said that our bills would reflect the $800 for the two trade-ins in due time.  Well, the bills continue at full rate. How dare they take advantage of seniors.",0
I have been LOYAL customer for close to 20 that is twenty years and lately they have chosen me my account to be slowest internet speed 4.12 down load speed and upload of 1.32 that is a disgrace for your service of $55 dollars a month,0
"I was with Tmobile for over 10 years, but it really went downhill. Poor customer service and price kept hiking every year. No quality service or benefits (upgrades, discounts, promotions) staying with them. I tried to keep my number, but they wouldn't let me when I switched carriers. All customer support people I talked too were from India or Philippines and they weren't that helpful.",0
I have been a customer of T-Mobile‘s for nine years. I went into the store today after being told I had a $3000 credit limit to upgrade my iPhone 12 to iPhone 16 Pro Max and was told essentially because although I make my payment on time every month I split the payments up into two payments. I’m being judged and now they want me to pay a total of $900 for two phones so I will be leaving T-Mobile.,0
"so here it is tmobile is over charging customers, here it is I have paid 1780 in fees and for services for the last 3 months to owe tmobile 1726 for services and fees to now being threaten to turn off my services for 200 dollars on a over payment they got in November and made adjustment on my billed to still charge it and get a message stating I have a past due for December 16 of 212 dollars to pay 300 on that 212.00 to owe them now 600 dollars! That’s a rip off! The supervisor said it well the 212 was past due but it was incorrect! How? How can a company say you owe them 212 in past due fees on the 16 of December to get a payment of 300 on the 23rd of December to now owe you 600 on the 25  and they turning my services off! Sad Tmobile, so the supervisor stated to now having to pay us more to get your phone back on to over charge again! this is not right!!",0
horrible company. piss poor coverage and rude personnel. when i paid them a year in advance they accused me of fraud. they are now dragging out mf refund. horrible company,0
Over the last year or so T mobile service in Denver has become near non existent. I can barely make calls and if I am able to make one they drop almost immediately. My texts don’t go through and I never have internet unless I’m connected to WiFi. It doesn’t matter where I am in Denver or Colorado. I’ve been unable to contact family during emergencies and unable to carry out payments with my phone when there isn’t WiFi. I can’t imagine worse coverage. I just paid off my phone so that I could unlock it and switch. I cannot recommend enough that you do not switch to T mobile under any circumstances.,0
"Very likely the worst customer service amongst telecom companies. Lost my phone while traveling in Europe, and tried to get a new SIM card to install in a temporary phone one of my family members gave me. Spent €180 in phone calls with them, in which I was told that the first SIM i was sent was not the correct one because it had a protection feature that could not be removed; and after the supposedly “correct” second SIM was received, ran into exactly the same problem. The reps on the phone don’t seem to know anything that has to do with international travel situations, and they refuse to let you talk to supervisors and managers. It’s a total disaster…",0
"In December, I upgraded my phone but decided to return it under their policy and purchased a different one. My trade-in had already been processed, but after extensive conversations in-store and online, I was assured by multiple T-Mobile representatives that the bill credits from the first purchase would transfer to the second.Fast forward a year, and I’ve discovered that wasn’t true. I didn’t notice the missing credits sooner because my bill is already higher than other providers. When I reached out, T-Mobile apologized (Chat Reference ID: 2cd9bf0e-5733-44bc-aae8-ceeffd5fa014) and offered to start issuing the credits now—spread over the next two years until December 2026. But this doesn’t address the almost $500 already stolen from me because multiple people lied to me about transferring the trade in device credits.Under the original agreement, my phone would have been paid off by December 2025, and my bill would have been $40–50 cheaper per month. Instead, I’m stuck paying for their mistake.T-Mobile, I want a refund for the money you owe me, not just future credits. This is unacceptable.",0
"Worst phone carrier ever, do not waste your time. I switched from Verizon for 8 days, had the most horrible phone service I’ve ever experienced, called in to switch back and was told my four lines were closed out and no balance on the account. A month later I receive a phone call from T-Mobile saying I owe $246, as I’ve called in and spoke to someone and their manager they refuse to make it right and because it wasn’t closed out properly (somehow that’s my fault) they are leaving a balance on the account until I pay it. I will never be using T-Mobile for the rest of my life and I don’t recommend it for anyone.",0

"I bought an iPhone for the first time. It was carrier locked through T-Mobile so I called the customer service and the snarky lady on the other end kept asking for an account number though I explained twice that I didn’t have service with them and didn’t understand why they could not use the iMei like every other company I had gone through to look into the issue. The woman was rude and didn’t provide any other info as to what I could do.Needless to say I have a phone I can’t use and I wouldn’t use T-Mobile if they were the last company on earth, I’d write letters and mail them first. Thanks for nothing T-Mobile.",0
"I was quoted a price of $150/month for a new cellphone plan (including two new phones) in-store (3315 Westpark Dr, Houston, TX 77005) and the price I’m actually paying is $90/month higher than what they quoted me. I’ve called customer service and the store multiple times and no one has solved my issue. This is outrageous. It was deceptive. It was a total bait-n-switch. They need to be held accountable for what they promise.",0
"It's unbelievable how difficult it is to get it is to get anything done with their customer service. I signed up for 2 business internet lines, 2 business phone lines with trade-ins. I have spent collectively 7 hours on the phone with sales and various customer service departments just trying to get the lines set up, phones traded in, and business internet set up.",0
"Just found out that they changed their policy, when the account is suspended they still charge the full amount.  Last year it was a not so reasonable $10/month, now it is just a ripoff!   Will return the gateway modem from now on, and need it will go pick up a new one....",0
"The people at my local store, refused to help me carry two small boxes inside, from my car. I told them I was physically disabled and all three said no. I had to struggle getting the boxes in.

"Won't go into big story, this company is a money making scamming franchise. I know of a few law suits on them now. The bad thing is the fcc, the US government and others choose to ignore and let them do what they do. This is why we have bad things going on in this world today. Yes some folks are allowed free reign ,however Don't let a no one like me try to some illegal crap, I'll sit in jail until I rot. TMobile is a bunch of crooks and scammers. But their day is coming!!!!😁",0
Terrible customer service I upgraded router to the new one and sent the old one back with ups  now they saying that the was damage because the little paper sticker in the back is scratched and they charged me  79.00 dollars for it . Impossible to resolve issue. Supervisors are useless  and uncaring . I'm ready to drop the whole service . Feels like scam,0
"In July, I signed up for internet service but then learned their speed was inadequate for my needs. I cancelled within 48 hours but was told that the contract gave them 60 days to make the cancellation effective during which time they would bill my card. Customer service assured me that after those 2 months all payments would be refunded to my card. It is now December- 5 months later - and no refund. I called and was told that they will now process the refund. I asked why it had taken so long and was told that they don’t ever make the refund until the customer calls and asks for it. These people are snakes. I will never do business with them again.",0
"F-n HATE this company. I had Sprint since Sprint was Nextel. Then T-Mobile bought Sprint and promised that Sprint customers would go to TMobile towers - LIE #1. They used the same old nonworking Sprint towers. I couldn't even get cell service inside or outside my own condo. And that's a problem as a First Responder in FL, esp during the pandemic and hurricane season when I'm on call. Thankfully I had a separate work phone (Verizon) that worked. As for my responder discount, I've been trying since Nov 2024 (it is now Dec 2024) to verify it using the whackass busted app called T-Life and I'm even on the phone trying to get a person for an hour. Also, upgrades were supposed to come with Costco bucks, but I ain't seen mine yet. Two tin cups with a string would work better than this. Everything about this company is broke, busted and utter crap. GO ELSEWHERE.",0

I've had to listen to it > 2 than a minute of canned frustrating announcements before it would put me into a queue for a human representative.

They did take the time to call me and repeat six times that they don't control Apple and that Apple hasn't hinge to do with them, providing  me an add-on that isn't working. The tmobile tech also called me at 10 pm to repeat the same thing, again! I was sleeping at that time! Now I am angry! Your company sucks with lazy minds, and I will tell the world why I feel this way!",0
"I wish I could give 0 , MISS information just to make more money , when they do get the money the response is “ we can’t do anything about it” bought a new phone “on them” and now they want me to pay it off in order to use it internationally when they told me I won’t have to ! Fkn Ridiculous",0
"The WORST service that I’m absolutely dumbfounded. Called to get a receipt for a temporary eSIM. A receipt. 1 hour goes by and they still can’t resolve the issue, I ask to speak to the supervisor who turns out to be the absolute worst person for the job imaginable. The person’s name was AJ. After explaining my situation to him and that I’ve been on the call with them for an hour, AJ had zero apologies but instead began to argue with me over their incompetence 😂 said that their security is just SO good that they can’t access my account by any means. When I said that this experience was disappointing, he has the nerve to argue and say “no it is not” after which I hung up. So AJ if you’re reading this, hope you get fired and work someplace FAR from customers.",0
"Closing this account has been a nightmare.  I have been to the store three times to request that the account be closed, with each time getting a verbal confirmation, yet each month they continue to bill my account.  I have spent countless hours on the phone as well.  I finally had to close our bank account to prevent further charges.  After over $1000 of fraudulent charges, T-Mobile still refuses to provide documentation that the account has been closed, or to refund the charges.  I'm now exploring what to do in response to this fraudulent interaction.",0
I called to get my balance. The representative barely spoke English. He said he couldn't verify me and will not give me any information on my account. I've had the same number for 20 years. I DID understand the part where when I asked he said he was in the Philippines.Shame on you T-Mobile that yououtsource for the sacrifice of quality customer service. I'm looking into another carrier tomorrow!,0
"I would give 0 Star if I could.  We purchased a Home Internet system - Home Internet Plus.  When we were done, they gave us 3 trackers for ""FREE"".  Two days later (including Thanksgiving"", we went to the store to return the trackers as we didn't think we would use them.  We were told that we had to pay $20/each restock fee to return them.  Nobody even asked us if we wanted them when we purchased the system.  They just put in the bag with the  internet package, without explaining any extra possible charges, such as if we lost one and others..  We feel that it was a scam designed by the company or the sales representatives working there were not honest.",0
Would give them a zero!!   Tried to return because internet didn’t work in my house.  Argued for 1 hour with customer service over 1.83.  Was so tempted to just pay it.  The support representative kept telling me it was a legitimate charge but I canceled in the allotted amount of time.   Finally asked for a manager  and they were able to take the charge off.  This is a very bad way to treat customers!!,0
Companies a THIEF helping themselves with other people's bank accounts after REFUSING to issue a confirmation number.. after I've been a customer for 15 years..spend your money elsewhere.. would NEVER recommend..,0
"T-Mobile cheats me when I went to the store on Black Friday at 8:00AM. The saleman told me about T-Mobile Internet and asked me to try out for two weeks free.  I agreed and took the brand new modem home.  By 6:45PM, I returned to the store and returned the new modem back without opening the box.  I told him I'm not interested.  So, I did a paper work and printed me a receipt.Now T-mobile charged me $218.20 including $160 monthly phone service. Don't ever try out with their offer.T-Mobile advertised I can get discount for my old Iphone trade-in for $150. After all transactions, I received an email I only got $45 and I need to get another $90 from Apple.  I canceled my order.Don't buy Iphone from T-Mobile or Phone Service provider. Buy directly from Apple store.  The store does not have what you need and they need to order anyway.",0
"STAY AWAY. A SCAM. In the USA:  I switched to them, found out within two days that I couldn't get coverage at my home or office so closed account.  For SIX months, I've been trying to get a refund for the money I paid since the coverage didn't work. NONE.  Been working on this, they never call you back.  Today, just found out despite escalation there is a clause that says even if you don't use the service you owe that amount.  I switched because I have several friends that have used them for decades all over the world without any problems. DON'T BE TEMPTED.  STAY AWAY.  THEY WILL NEVER HELP YOU.",0
Tmobile sucks and it keeps disconnecting don’t use tmobile if you want to have good connection,0
"I paid off my phone and I switched my service to a new company. I asked T Moblie to unlock my phone multiple times but it is locked for the second week. First time I called I spent 40 minutes on the phone with the T Mobile they told me that the phone is not purchased via T-Mobile so they would not unlock it. I explained that T-Mobile sold me the phone and I used to pay monthly to T Mobile for this phone. She replied that since the phone is not from T-Moble she cannot help me to unlock it. I had to explain again that I have all the paperwork in front of me showing that it was purchased from T-Mobile and in each bill it is stated that I paid for the phone with a final balance to be paid. She asked me to do some resetting and try to unlock it but with no result. Finally  I was informed that I would get an email, and the matter would be taken care of by the technical department and the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. I did not get any email and after 4 days the phone was not unlocked.Next time I called I spent 80 minutes on the line with T Mobile going through settings on my phone and mostly waiting on line. The lady told me that the phone was not used so it cannot be unlocked. I explained that I have been using the phone for a year. She replied: “since the phone was not used the phone cannot be unlocked”  I had to repeat that I just said that I was using the phone for a year. And so on, and so on. Finally she said that the phone will be unlocked for sure this time in 24 hours. But nothing happened. We talked 2 days later and went thru the settings and I was told that the phone will be unlocked in 24 hours. It wasn't. I called 2 days later and I spent 2 hours on the phone with one lady and next another gentleman. Finally he asked me to go to the T-Mobile store. I explained that I already did go to the store but they said they don’t handle unlocking the phones and I have to call T-Mobile. But he explained that I need to go to another location so I did go to find the same reply, “we don’t handle the unlocking of phones, please call T-Mobile.",0
"T Mobile updated their Voice Mail application, and it is no longer accessible.  Called the help desk, and they didn’t know what to do either.  The T Mobile new voice mail application used to work fine, however the new application is broken, and their folks do not know how to fix it yet.",0
Left T-Mobile because they did the bait and switch regarding free Netflix. Now I have a credit balance for $(6.79) and they say they can't access my account without a pin to issue me a refund check. Instead I keep getting monthly statements saying my credit will be applied to next months bill. Worst customer service and a reminder why I left them.,0
"Stopped in a T Mobile store last week to inquire about current promotions that they had. I walked out with a deal that I couldn't say no to and they put it in writing. However a few hours later after talking with T Mobile Customer Service I found out that they performed a Bait and Switch tactic and was signed up for a plan all totally different and much more expensive then was agreed to and put in writing. They told me I was welcome to return the equipment back to the store. When I attempted to return it the next day, T Mobile told me that it is their policy to charge a restocking fee which was huge, over $100.00. I refused told them that I was going to keep their equipment until I receive a call from a higher up supervisor in the company but as of the date so far I never received a phone call after repeated attempts and I am still holding on to their equipment. Needless to say I will never do business with T Mobile ever again",0
"After 20 plus years with this company they did nothing to make things easier. After my rate kept increasing there were no deals to keep my bill at a decent rate for just one line. I switched over to Xfinity and tried to use my Google pixel (that had been paid off completely) and keep my number. I have been waiting over a week to get them to unlock my phone so I can use it with Xfinity. Ever time I call it's the same thing, ""they're waiting for business solutions"". I have been told it takes 10 minutes at the most to unlock a phone. And I have been waiting this long. T-Mobile does not care about their customers. They do nothing to help you out. I really don't agree that they would be voted best customer service.",0
No stars if allowable. They are liars and scammers. When communication with them on social media they’ll block you for leaving a negative review. They are the worst company. Charge you for bills after your number has been ported to another carrier. Reported this on my credit and refused to remove it after they agree it’s their error. I’ve already experienced adverse effects from this from long standing creditors.,0
This company's phone service is terrible. There customer service is shit. They lie to get you in. I canceled my service in August and I am here with another bill in November on hold. These people should be shut down. They are a bunch of theives,0
"I got my first cell phone in 1994, just when cell phones were becoming popular. My service then was through AT&T Wireless.  As you can imagine at that time cell towers were few and far between. My cell service then was 10 times better than it is today with T mobile.  T mobiles’ service is absolutely terrible everywhere I go!!   I’ll be loving as soon as possible and will NEVER return!",0
"Are the customer reps at T-Mobile in a competition to see who can be the rudest and least helpful overall to their clients? That is the only explanation I can fathom for the continued experience I've had with the company over these past three years. On the technical side, I do receive basically reliable phone service and I can live with the bill. While all my devices are eligible for upgrade, and I want to upgrade all of our devices; T-Mobile doesn't want to reach across the aisle with any enticing offers. They are beyond greedy and show no respect for long time loyal customers.",0
"Unbelievable, I had to return a cell phone to T-Mobile and an IPad that was under warranty. The phone is fine but they sent me a different color ipad that was damaged with dents ans scratches. The representative assured me she would call me back to see if I should keep my iPad and return theirs or vice versa, she called me and said hold the iPads I am waiting for an answer but never called back now despite giving them the tracking numbers for both devices being returned they are billing me $1600 !!! Time to leave Tmobile no one can clarify the bill, a new rep is in contact with me who said she will have the old rep call me now the old rep calls back and says they can't take there own damaged replacement back!!!!",0
"If I could give a zero that'd be more appropriate for this review.  I'm on a family plan and was interested in staying with TMobile but wanted off the plan, stay with TMobile and get a new number.  I researched their plans and decided to go with the 55 plus plan as I will be 66 this Friday.  The person at the store was not very interested in helping me or offering any feedback.  Frustrated I  said, ""ok I'll go with AT&T"".  Want to know what he said, ""ok, good luck""  The entire time I was with him he seemed more interested in what he was doing on the computer than helping me so I left.  Went to another carrier and notified my friend who said that's disappointing the lack of interest I was given and she will process this and may follow me to the other carrier.  She's been with TMobile for years but was very disappointed in the lack of professional customer Service and may leave herself.  That's all.",0
"Last year, I was influenced by a T-Mobile ad. I went to their website and it says my rural area in middle Ga, 30 miles outside Macon Ga, was a strong signal area. I ordered their SIM card, and it gave me zero bars. Thankfully, I was refunded. I now have 1 bar (always) with an ATT SIM card.",0
They are definitely liars. Promise you one thing and do something different. It's impossible to talk to an English person let alone a manager. You can't reason with these foreigners. Best you can do is file a complaint with the FCC and Better business.,0
"I’ve been experiencing nonstop issues with T-Mobile. I no longer have service with them, yet they continue to withdraw money from my account every month. When I request them to remove my credit card information from the account, they claim that I no longer have an account, so they cannot access it to remove the information. As a result, they just keep taking money from my account. This situation is absurd and unreasonable, and when I do manage to speak with a customer service representative, the issues persist.",0
Terrible customer service. Utterly incompetent team who messed up my sim and I had to go a week without a phone service because they cancelled my sim and refused to reactivate it so that I can port out. They also took 60 dollars without my permission and without checking compatibility with my phone. It took them 2 seconds to take the money and then cancel my sim. but 5 days before anyone started on working on my issue. they also lied to me and 2 hrs per day on call with they horrible care reps,0
I was a customer for 3yrs with Crooked T-Mobile. Giving up my account for their convenience did me no good. Still”they took their payment April 4th. By the 5th my service was terminated. It was hell from that date on. The whole month they’re sending Tickets to locate the payment. By the end of the month I was drained. Moving on to another carrier was my only option. But”not with slimy T-mobile one can’t move on. They blocked my iPhone as if I owed them money I had prepaid pay as I go. And”it is now 12/23/24 those Crooks never reimburse me my $67.08. I’m on fixed income I’m not rich”I went out a bought Tshirts that reads. I was Robbed by T-Mobile. Join the movement these big companies are to powerful with our money.,0
"T-Mobile was hacked around 2023 and since thenmy phone is flooded with daily text messages askingfor donations to Trump campaign, my opinions aboutRepublican candidates, surveys and messages fromcandidates. Reporting text as junk and delete doesn’t help because random numbers continue.Only eats up my iOS memory.",0
"The instore sales people are wholly incompetent and then fall back on the signed paperwork as what is confirmed.Even if the money to tmobile is exactly the same, they won't rectify anything on their end and will fall back on the contract terms.Woefully incompetent through and through sales/customer service reps and frankly should be a class action lawsuit somewhere.",0
"Worst customer service EVER !!!!  Go to any other phone provider, run go !!!",0
"Their customer service is awful. I cancel their overpriced cell service to get a better deal with a different provider. They still took money from my account. I called and explained to them that I cancelled the service, but they insisted they were right. They were not right. They keep sending me notices that I have a credit that will be applied to my next bill. How can that be when I don't have an account. I have called multiple times to get a refund and I'm given the run around and never get the money I am owed. Today I had to jump through more hoops to finally get the promise of a prepaid card mailed to me. The money NEVER should have left my bank account! I am glad to not be a customer with this company that thinks it is okay to steal from a person's bank account and then have the audacity to make them prove that the money was wrongfully taken out of their account. If you had the correct system of accounts, you would be able to see on a closed account that the customer is owed a refund. Start taking accountability and show your customers some respect. This ordeal has been many months in the making. Glad it is over. I do not recommend this company at all!",0
"Terrible company owes me $1100, was rude; just terrible. Now dragging me along. Stay wat",0
published review 12/5/24I had T-Mobile for over 10 years and I decided to switch last April because the coverage was getting bad. After I switched I called T-Mobile customer service to unlock the phones and cancel my service. Yesterday my wife noticed they have been charging us for months and when I called to get a refund they said that I never cancelled. They have the record of me calling to unlock my phones and cancel those but they kept 1 line and charged me over $165 a month and will not refund my money. They stated that I never requested to cancel a line that I never had. When you sign up the sleazy salesman sign you up for extra lines for there promotions and do not tell you about it. My line had 9 lines and I only have 3 phones and a iPad. Run from this crappy company.,0
Don't buy any accessories through t-mobile!  I have been with them for years but the return window is so short and you can't return anything without doing a live chat.  I spent days using the app and the online system and finally decided to chat with an agent.  It took several tries to get through the automated agent and then I received no help from the live agent.,0
"They are only nice as long as your a customer, but as soon as you switch then thier attuide changes when you talk to um on the phone. They over charge you on your bill and use a phrase called a one time charge to make money after you canceled your service to charge you  7 dollars over and over again",0
NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE A CUSTOMER OF TMOBILEHorrible experience. I have been a customer of TMobile for over 7 years with 4 open accounts and paid my bills on time. I have always had insurance to protect my phones and account. My phone broke on 12/24/24 and I went to the store. They said they could not do anything and go to the insurance. We called the insurance and they sent a new phone. I was on a call to transfer the information from the old phone to the new one for more than 3 hours and TMobile could not do it. They blamed the new phone and ordered a new one to be shipped to the store. They said it would take them about 15 minutes to transfer the information. I was just at the store and TMoblie put the wrong information on the phones and I could not get it transferred. I spent another 3 hours on the phone trying to figure out at the store and the only thing can do is order me another phone that will take another 4 days to arrive. I will be without a phone for more than a week and all TMobile wants to do is to give me a free cheap phone or to upgrade and pay more for a new phone.  The supervisor on the phone did nothing but blame the store or the first customer service representative and did not provide a solution. After 7 years I will bring my business elsewhere since TMobile does not care. It is all about the money to them!,0
If I could leave a zero rating I would.  I was with them for nearly 25 years with always paying them on time.  However switching from their company to another is hell with misinformation and multiple late fees as a result.  I advise if you are starting with a new cell phone carrier to choose any other company.,0
"Switched to a much cheaper service with far superior coverage but can't stop payment at t-mobile because I can't remember the PIN I set over 2 years ago.  So just hop on the t-mobile app and reset my PIN as per their call center IVR ‐ sounds easy right?  Nope, since I'm no longer a customer, I cannot reset my PIN!  Go to the store to find out there are things on my account that don't apply to us like home internet and an iPad, we never had either.  Have we been paying for those things?  Your guess is as good as mine and theirs, they really don't know.  Without a PIN, absolutely no one can help me.  We just paid what we paid and we're still paying and there's quite literally nothing that can be done about it.  No one in the local store and no one in customer service can help me despite all of them being able to tell we canceled the service so I have to pay $40 to stop pay at the bank level.  If you're in the market, find any other company on the planet but this one.",0
"Would give 0 stars if it were an option, Tmobile has overpriced plans. I would recommend basically any other cell service company if you care about what is in your bank account. If you do have Tmobile currently, better watch the amount closely because it can and will change on you with no notice beyond just being present on your billing statement. If you're canceling your bill, you better ask if there are any additional charges because if there is, they will not inform you beyond a letter in the mail like we in the 1960s and they don't have your email address.",0
Run.......The worst customer service.  Two days trying to return a defective tablet.  Nothing but the run around and talked to some many people and a different story with each one!!!  i would NEVER EVER recommed them for tablets.,0
"STAY AWAY!!! After more than 20 years with Sprint/T-mobile, I recently switched phone service to Spectrum about a week before the end of the billing cycle. I was immediately locked out of my online T-mobile account, yet they managed to draft another full month’s payment. I called to request the final bill which took almost another month to receive. I was billed extra for closing my account mid-cycle. So instead of getting a refund, they said I still owed yet a partial payment. I still couldn’t log in to pay the balance, request a refund or anything at all because I no longer have an account. Then once again they managed to draft my bank account for the amount they say I owe. What a terrible company!  So glad I switched to Spectrum. My phone service is so much more reliable and I am paying less than half what T-mobile was charging monthly. I will never go back to them after this.",0
Deceptive.  Offer rebates and promotions that they do not honor.  There’s a class action lawsuit dated 12/8/24 for this.  I hope I can join.  There’s a reason they have 1.5 stars across the board.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with T-Mobile’s customer service and policies. My wife and I purchased a brand new iPhone 14, and after two days, we decided to return it unopened in exchange for an IPhone 15. To our shock, we were hit with a ridiculous $70 restocking fee. The store clerk had clearly told us that we had until Monday (three days after the purchase) to return the phone, especially since we were still deciding between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15.Despite this, T-Mobile refused to waive the fee. We’ve been loyal customers for years, but this experience has made us question our commitment to the company. It’s incredibly frustrating to be treated this way, especially when we followed the store’s instructions. I will seriously reconsider my options moving forward. We’ve since disputed the charge with our bank because a restocking fee is a complete gimmick designed to make more money for a multimillion-dollar company. It makes no sense to charge a restocking fee for a phone that was never opened and was returned just two days later.T-Mobile, please do better—your long-time customers deserve more respect and transparency.",0
"**""T-Mobile SCAM - Broken Promises on Promotions!""**I recently switched to T-Mobile after they called and offered me an incredible deal: $45 per line for four lines, plus four brand-new iPhone 16s if I traded in our existing phones (all newer than iPhone 12 Pro models). This promotion was the only reason I switched over.However, after I joined, T-Mobile conveniently ""couldn't honor"" the promised deal. They claimed the best they could do was $500 off each phone, despite having all the recordings of our conversation. I feel completely scammed by T-Mobile’s bait-and-switch tactics. Be wary of any promotions they promise on the phone—what you hear may not be what you get!",0
"Multiple salespeople tell you that the first two weeks are a free trial period and that you won't be charged anything if you cancel within this period. That proved untrue.Since the access speed was extremely slow, I had to cancel it within a week of activation, and the rep confirmed that I wouldn't be charged anything. I immediately sent back the device. However, after two weeks of cancellation, I received bills asking me to pay a monthly fee plus one-time charge. T-Mobile is now on my blacklist.",0
"Quite expensive, I was in the USA for some weeks and used it, would not fully recommend.",1
Didn't have many choices on prepaid phones if they had more prepaid phones then a bigger selection it would be all right,1
"Our internet is not always reliable. It goes out frequently weekly, but when it works it's fairly quick. Unfortunately the problem hasn't been resolved yet.",1
Poor customer service.Their fiber service isn't very reliable. Has issues that they won't admit to. And won't fix either.Plenty of issues either they want to roll a truck out to you but charge you if they find nothing or they want to replace your equipment when it's already been replaced twice.I won't give  them anything less because overall it's been tolerable at least in my situation. Unlike other companies I've dealt with that weee much worse. They at least have a small level of stability.But poor customer service and tech support is the reason I take the stars,1
"This should’ve been a one star, but Jerome ID # JW913Q Completely saved the day. For about 30 hours, I couldn’t use my work cell phone Because three different individuals in the customer service couldn’t figure out how to get my phone connected to the E-SIM. It took only 40 minutes and that is including me calling in and verifying my information so most likely around 20 minutes it took Jerome to fix the issue. If it had not been for him, I was getting ready to cancel everything.",1
Just reporting after paying off an ATT phone and not being on subscription plan the online phone unlock does NOT work.This forces you contact customer support force them to unlock your phone. Yes they trying to keep you on. There are services that are cheaper than ATT plans.,1
"I lost Internet service after 8 pm Friday 6/7/24. Called to report it and was told AT&T had a outage in my area and it would be repaired by 7 am the next day. By 7 am Saturday 6/8/24 my Internet was still down. Was told it would be Monday evening 6/10/24 before they could get someone out. I noticed on Saturday morning that the fiberoptic cable ,from the utility pole, was on the ground of my neighbor's property. 3 days without Internet is rediculous.",1
"I spent well over an hour and a half speaking with OSHAINE from ATT this morning.  The reason it was so frustrating had nothing to do with OSHAINE as he maintained his calm and friendly Demeanor the whole time and he did, eventually, through his knowledge of non published methods, get my Tv and remote working properly again.  I thank him sincerely for his professional service.Billy",1
"I was with another phone service for 3 years. I live in a very rural area and to make matters worse, it's in valley so service was sketchy and to add insult to injury, the rates kept going up.  About a year ago, I switched to AT&T and my service has improved 100%.  Customer service is always helpful and except for being gouge when I missed a payment, I have no complaints.  I'm on a fixed income so low cost is important but staying in contact with family and friends and being able to cal out in case of emergency is of utmost importance.  I'm sure glad I switched from Verizon to AT&T.",1
"The reception can be patchy in the ATL area, but honestly the prices compared to other providers are pretty good. I don't think I'll switch anytime soon unless something better comes up.",1
"Great products, not so great service. We have frequent outages in my area caused by a small animal chewing on a wire. I doubt that's the reason for the frequent outages, but if it is, why can't they make something that can't be easily damaged by rodents?",1
"The connection they offer is not very stable and don't bother calling customer service, they will just say the problem is on your end.And when it comes to speed, it is too expensive for what you get, I do not recommend their service.",1
"I tried att air for seven day trial.  It worked fine initially-faster speed, easy set up and cheaper than my current plan. However, a major issue was noted that caused me to return the unit. Air runs off of cell towers that only provide “dynamic”ip addresses (meaning that the ip address changes every day). This caused my apps(Hulu live and Utube live) to change location every day.  Got locked out of Hulu because of the 4 locations change cap. Requires “static” ip address.  Tech support said this cannot be changed.  So… back it went to att.A month later I received a-bill for $121.71 ( two months) .  I called to make sure we are not charged to card.  Charges waived. Told toDisregard emails about return,billing etc.Three months later I got an automated email notification that my account will go to collection for amount of $67.81.  Had to call to get this fixed since automated email would destroy my credit rating.  They (billing) saidagain to ignore any automated emails as account will be closed ( it should have been closed the first time).",1
"We have been an AT&T Mobile Phone customer for many years. Service has been OK.We upgraded our phones due to AT&T advertising - ""Upgrade your phone for Free if it is paid off"".  The Sugar Land, TX  Store did this but did not tell us about all the Fees involved: Upgrade Fee, Installment amount that they said we would get back later., etc. They said our new Bill should only go up about $1.00/month. This first Bill went up $98, instead of going down.Now we are ""stuck"" with a 3 year Installment ""loan"" for a ""Free"" Phone, even though there are offset credits. We asked when we would get the offset credits back, the store said we would get these first couple of months fees back at the end of the 3 year contract.We feel Deceived by AT&T. Misrepresentation and dishonesty.",1
"Decided to switch from my old carrier in January 2023.  Ordered the lavender Galaxy 23 Plus in early February 2023.  Still didn't have it by my birthday (02/26), and was told by the local store that somehow the order got cancelled.  Local store reordered it in and finally I visit the store to get it on March 14th, 2023.  I ordered lavender but all that the store had was black, as lavender is allegedly still on backorder... Had also picked out a lavender case before I even put in the original order, but at the store, no lavender cases.  Sat there for over an hour awaiting the data transfer, then $184 later, I'm out the door with the phone... only to discover at home that all of my calls and most of my text messages are still going only to the phone from my former carrier.  Didn't get anything that I wanted out of this deal other than a new phone, but I could have walked out the door with it from my old carrier for about $20 cheaper.  This is a horrible way to start a new relationship with a customer and I am seriously considering a return since I'm still in the 14-day window.  The employee who helped me along the way has been nothing but courteous and professional, but I feel like ALL of this should have been taken care of by now.  So annoyed!",1
I and others I know purchased a galaxy 22 ultra.  It has been the most frustrating phone I have ever owned.  It gives me more problems and has more issues.  I wish I still had my note 9.  It was great.  I believe something is wrong with the S22 Ultra.  I am far from happy with this phone!!,1
"First my email address was hacked then I changed the primary email, then I noticed they changed it back to the old primary email. Which I asked them to remove the old email from my account which they never did.My wi-fi on my pc is 2.4 when it is supposed to be 5ghz.I received a duplicate phone number however, the business that I received the duplicate number changed their number after I contacted them.They do not like to respond by email to complaints they prefer to call and then it's your word against theirs.I am not interested in going to another company, they should just fix the issues and try to keep their especially long-time customers. Now, I do not want Fiber, I am satisfied with the service I have now.Well, I received a notice that they are charging $5.00 more for internet, and I do not have Fiber. No excuse for the increase.The service was hacked, and they sent out a letter informing the customers, now they want to increase the internet service. Not good customer service from At&t.My former router modem which I received was not refurbished it still had old customers information such as parent child safety which kept me from making changes to router modem, so I just sent it back and received a replacement.What are they doing to retain their customer's?No Senior citizen discounts. lolJust expect better from them especially since my bills are up to date not that it makes a difference.Well, I will be checking out other internet services as of now!",1
"It is a good thing that AT&T provides me with good cellular service because I had a horrible experience with a representative when I was in an AT&T store to buy a new phone.  I was snapped at and spoken rudely to by the service representative. I don’t know if there is no training being given to these service representatives, or whether this woman was having a horrendous day, but there is no reason why a service representative should snap at a customer.",1
"I have a pre-pay plan that works for me. The only way to get any customer service is to go to my store. If you call you will be on the phone for a very long time. My first experience at the ATT store was awful. I purchased a new smart phone, my first one, and the man that waited on me told me that he could not transfer my phone numbers. He also didn't show me anything about the phone. I called the next day and talked to someone else and she told me to come back to the store and she would help me. I went in and she was very nice and helpful. I also talked to the manager of the store and made a complaint about my first experience. If I need anything I always call ahead and make sure that the woman who helped me is there. It seems that there is not a lot of good customer service at a lot of stores these days.",1
I've been a customer for over 25 years at the same address.  All of a sudden my phone doesn't work and my bill is paid.  They sent a Service Tech who could not fix things.  I'm so mad I could spit.,1
AT&T is getting shut down for good and being banned from the United States!!,1
"I had AT&T internet service at a rural location, and it has been consistently terrible from the start. I grew tired of constantly having to call them to complain about it (as they couldn't do anything to make it better anyway). Daily, we had to reset the router to get it working again, and the speed varied between 1 and 15 Mbps (averaging around 8 when it felt like working). After enduring a couple of years of this ""service,"" I was relieved to find that T-Mobile offered a more affordable solution.When I called AT&T to discontinue the service, the salesperson suggested ""suspending"" the account instead of closing it. This sounded good at the time since I was unsure whether T-Mobile would be worse than them. Unfortunately, the salesperson failed to mention that the service would automatically resume after 3 months.T-Mobile ended up being three times faster (without the resets!) for less than half the cost of AT&T. Needless to say, there was no reason to reactivate AT&T service. However, they still had my credit card on file, and it turns out they had been charging me for over 5 months—over $100/mo—before I caught it on my credit card statement. And please note that when I went online to check the account it was shown as disabled!When I called them to address the issue, they acknowledged the mistake and mentioned that it would take multiple weeks to rectify, promising a callback. I explicitly told them to close the account. Unfortunately, they never called me back. After seeing yet another bill, I called them again. This time they couldn't charge it since I had them remove my credit card from the file. During the call, they agreed that the account should have been closed, and the charge was invalid.I'm still waiting for them to call me with my $500+ refund, but instead, I received a notice from the collection agency for the money they couldn't charge me after the second attempted account closure. If this is not an example of extreme incompetence, I don't know what is. AT&T, get your act straight and give me my money back! Please!Update 1/3/24: Upgrading from 1 star to 3 stars. After multiple further unsuccessful engagements with AT&T customer support, I ended up initiating a dispute which prompted ATT Office of the President (top tier customer support) contacting me. Donato A. was able to help me and issue the refund as well as cancel the invalid debt collection. Thank you Donato!",1
Just switched my business to AT&T phone and internet due to the promise of fiber internet. Was previously with Comcast and didn't really have a big problem with them. Switched about 1 month ago and since then I've noticed about a quarter of the voicemails we receive are chopped up and cannot be comprehended. Fortunately I can get envelope information with the phone number the message was received from and call them back but the information in the message has to be relayed again which is frustrating for the customer as well as us.Finally made contact with AT&T and was surprised to hear that this has been a known issue that is apparently a problem with Verizon wireless customers leaving voicemails. The representative told me there is nothing AT&T can do about it as it's a problem on Verizon's side of things. The problem happens with Verizon customers that are within the state that try to leave voicemails. Out of state Verizon customers don't have that problem apparently.My cell phone service is through Verizon and I have left messages at my shop that are clear and have no problem.It's not the end of the world as I can just get envelope information about the not decipherable call and call them back. But people that take time to leave a voicemail usually leave information that I'd like to have prior to calling them back so it makes the process a little more inconvenient.AT&T offered no type of time line on resolution and told me it was a problem Verizon has to deal with not them. I never had this issue before with Comcast and only first had this problem come up the day we switched from Comcast to AT&T.Just a little disappointed in the AT&T service and the response to this problem.,1
I don't like there customer care. Very slow to get response.You Guys really need to work on this.,1
Good company but they could do better with their products and pricings.,1
"Customer service is the worst ever. Talked to three different people over the course of an hour to add someone to my phone line and learned nothing after that time. Had to give ALL my information three times, one time for each customer service rep.Phone service is good",1
"The automated system would NOT give me an option to pay on my own. Maybe this is on purpose because as nice as the lady was, you at corporate FORCE THEM TO BUG THE CRAP OUT OF US. FOUR TIMES, I said, no, thank you to her sales spiels. Stop bothering us and let us just pay the bill. If we wanted to hear specials, we can ask. The call at that point was so long, I died, dried up into a mummy, was reincarnated and then died again.",1
"the stupid cell phone wouldnt play the mp3 i got off gcnlive for alex jones or some file as i remember,yet i did like how if you ran out of data the internet still worked at a lower speed",1
"I have been with AT&T wireless for about 30 years altogether. They use to be OUTSTANDING. Without question, the best service and customer service across the country.Then they bought Direct TV ... who was sinking because of their HORRIBLE customer service. AT&T put in Direct TV people and they were destroyed.I have no customer loyalty to them any more because they don't value me.",1
"We live in a rural area, so our only choice was DSL. The bill is much cheaper than satellite at just $56 per month. It runs one or two TVs at a time, but we do have to deal with buffering if we try to use our living room and bedroom tv simultaneously. Also had a difficult time getting everything set up, customer support would constantly tell us something different everyday. I also wish this internet would run my tv and my daughter's tablet at the same time.",1
"The internet and TV works when they do but when they encounter issues, that's when the nightmare starts. Customer service sucks. Long wait queue just to be transferred to I don't know where. Would always to suck money out of your pocket. Beware of their scheme. For every call, they will sell things you don't need and for sure won't use.",1
"I was so happy when I saw that At & T added the extra HBO and movie channels free during the wknd and Monday and then they took them away especially in these hard times they should show some loyalty and humanity for so many people at home when so many other companies and people are helping with money and compassionate actions..Sad..thinking of changing after contract is over..Lake Forest, CA 92630:( :( :(",1
Hardly any Service in my town. At home I have to use Wifi to call and text. I work from my phone so i need a good connection and it doesnt get a good signal at all hardly a bar.and Ill be in the middle of town .Tell us in that area you dont have good service and stop wasting our money.They do have the Best prepaid ratesNew service here i come I cant deal with it anymore.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer since I bought my first cell phone years ago.  Last week I purchased a replacement phone as my current cell phone had ""had it"".  Was advised that it would arrive between the 24th and 26th of Dec.  Christmas eve was told that now it it would be delayed by ONE MONTH.  I cancelled my order and went online at Best Buy, and FOUR HOURS later walked away with a better phone. Maybe AT&T should just direct us to Best Buy!",1
"AT&T is the service I use and have had for the last three months.  I got the new iPhone 13 and I’ve had 5g auto on the whole time( I’m the settings for cellular), we don’t get 5g with AT&T in grants pass so my phone has been going back and forth trying to search for a network. Thus, giving me slow speeds and using all my battery. I switched my phone to LTE only and I’ve not had any problems with connectivity, overheating, or my battery just plain dying. I wish this was something they explained to me while I was there because my battery health, nearly in a brand new iPhone is at 94%. There was nothing that anyone knew that could be causing This issue beside a “defect to the phone” I’m gonna say it’s the “5g” networks we do not receive that messes with our data.",1
I have been an AT&T customer for 5 years. They advertise the best 5G..... I have one of the newest phones out...still 4G. It honey depends on your location. I walk into work and have 1 bar. They guy next to me has Verizon with 4 bars. Direct TV is a Rip off...... Customer service is horrible. My Note9 works great at home but unfortunately I'm at work more than home. They all have their ups and downs. I've had both and honestly will be going back to Verizon soon......,1
"They're a mobile company what do you expect. The service works, they provide good service (have used as a customer and as a business-business is better service!). What more do you want? They are a corporation making money from a oligopoly and should be regulated as a utility for the public good but that's not for me to decide.",1
"Does anyone really love their cable or phone provider? In my many experiences, AT&T is not the worst, but it is also not the best. Their mobile service is decent, U-Verse TV is average and incredibly high-priced, but their internet has been some of the best I have had in Florida. So, 3 stars it is!",1
"I, personally, have never had any problem with AT&T, but I will be switching to a different carrier only because of their support and promotion of OAN and their contributions to other issues I do not morally condone or agree with.",1
"Decided to cancel my ATT cellular plan two months back. Was promised a free Iphone11 on my second visit with loyalty service only to receive my bill and be over charged $10. Manager said there’s no record from phone call with loyalty rep that she offered the phone for free or that she promised a specific billing price that would incur until I changed plan. Att has no loyalty to customers, only to con their customers to be falsely offered something over the phone so there is no evidence of transaction to keep us happy until billing arrives. Unbelievable that there is nothing in loyalty report to support my recall of discussion.",1
"Better options available, Verizon much better on all fronts.",1
"Not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, not as good as they claim. Thanks, Kevin from customer support for trying to help me. Worked to a certain degree.",1
"I opened an AT&T account in August of 2018. I had to pay for one Galaxy S9, and I received  one free. A couple of days ago one of the phones just shut for no apparent reason. My fiance had to buy a replacement $89.00 phone for that evening. AT&T tell us that the phone warranty is up and we would have to pay $112.00 deductible in order to recieve the same device. She nor I  did anything to cause the device to stop working. I never had a device from any carrier who's device just shut down. We have insurance for damages, or theft only. How can you give out devices that can't last until the upgrade period is applicable. Each customer should know they may have to spend additional funds if AT&T devices decide to stop working at the time of purchase.",1
"Maybe I expected too much...not! Got great service initially from the folks at the Kiosk at Windward Mall. Was excited that they were going to have a permanent store there. In the meantime I went to the store at Windward City and when they felt like speaking with me (TV was on and they were busy watching) I got misinformation. That's okay, people make mistakes. Went back, got help. Went to the new  store in Windward Mall. The young man was sarcastic when I explained my question, (Do you folks have customer service training?) then gave me the wrong information (low storage doesn't always mean you need a bigger card in your phone), I already had a larger card in my phone but he didn't look so how would he know. I cannot wait to end my contract, T-mobile was a little more money so I moved but am happy to go back and pay more for great customer service!",1
"They are the only service provider in my area with any signal.  It's pretty expensive & their website needs to be calmed down, but at least they work.",1
AT&T appears to listen to their reviews. We will follow with their business promises. It seems none of us want guns in the hands of babes. Good choice.,1
For the money we pay for for cable and phone is to much all ATT DO IS SHOW THE SAME BORING OLD ASS MOVIES UPGRADE  WITH THE MOVIES,1
get your rural customers the service they need you cheepscates you don't have to be in the money day one offer package to all,1
Tried using them for a month. Customer service are not very helpful but phone call clarity was good,1
"Why 3 stars?  Love my reception and phone but customer service is lacking and confused at best.   In the last 5 weeks I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with them.  I went back and added up the time.... (it's actually close to 11 and I am currently on the phone with them now)  This isn't a COVID thing, it was like this pre-COVID.  If you ask the same question to 5 people in CS, you get 5 different answers.  None are close to the others.  Someone needs to make a manual and share it with the employees and give them answers to questions people ask.I traded in 2 phones about 4 months... still no credit.  Auto Pay is a joke.  I paused it (I never opted in to use it), but it took out money anyway.  I cancel auto pay and have to pay $20 additional each month because I don't use AUTOPAY. I've been a customer 10 years, obviously I pay my bill.The only time I drop calls is when I call them and they transfer me..... it happens often then, but that's the only time.The other options aren't any better, but I do wish they would improve the customer service over the phone.",1
I see tons of bad reviews but I like my AT&T service... I think it is reasonable for cost and the service is great.,1
"Have cingular then it became AT&T. Ive been with them since they merged. What gets my goat is, they have unlimited data, but have data caps. When its busy they slow down your data speed. I have an older plan with 6 shared gigs. All the new plans have unlimited and most other companies offer unlimited. I was looking at the samsung Z flip for my wife. ATT told me they would give me the phone free if I trade my note 9 in and agree to a 36 month contract I wanted to keep my $1000 phone. So I can sign a 3 year contract and pay off the phone every month. I wanted to do a contract and pay for the phone with an upgrade discount. But nope they won`t do that. I also pointed out that Tmobile is giving away the 128gig samsung z flip for free to new customers and add a second line and they will give you an $800 off a second smart phone of your choice. So what`s my motivation to stay with ATT when I still only have a 6 shared gig plan and they are offering nothing for upgrading your plan. My contract has been fulfilled many months ago and the company is getting cheap with promo`s so maybe consider moving to Tmobile or Verizon. Both are offering better deals and stealing ATT customers. They must have so many they don`t really care.",1
Good speeds in the Texas area. Currently on U-verse for my home office. They can improve a bit on support though.,1
"I've been an AT&T customer my entire life. My family was back when they were Cingular Wireless, and then I got on my own plan when I was an adult. I am in my 30's. My primary reason for staying with AT&T so long was the good coverage and reasonable pricing, because any time I needed to make any changes to my account such as get a new phone, it was a nightmare and took hours to get everything all swapped over. Well, that good pricing recently changed. AT&T does not include their line access charges in their plan quotes like Verizon does, so you actually wind up paying significantly more than the advertised price. I think the thing that bothered me most, is when I contacted AT&T via chat to see what could be done now that we needed a new phone (which required their unlimited plans), the rep kept giving me different quotes, lied (hopefully accidentally) to me and told me the total she gave included the line access, then turned around and said it didn't. I don't feel like AT&T is clear on the charges that will be on your bill and that's extremely frustrating when trying to pick a plan. And honestly that whole experience plus the last few experiences I've had trying to get new phones has prompted this review. Verizon was transparent about everything on their site. Verizon was able to offer us free Hulu and Disney+ with our current plan, so that reduces a monthly expense for us, plus offer unlimited.",1
"My recent contact with AT&T wasn't about their service, it was about upgrading to a new phone. I have had AT&T for a very long time and although have had issues with dropped calls, so has other providers. My online experience today was good, but the person I was chatting with had limited access and knowledge to what I was looking for in a phone and seemed to be unaware that what I was looking for does exist. I am looking to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 7 active and the 2 features an upgrade must have is Gorilla Glass screen, not a protector you add or an otter box, but an actual Gorilla Glass screen. Was told that it had to be purchased separately. Not true...my current phone the Samsung Galaxy S7 active came factory with Gorilla Glass and totally water proof. My next must be is water proof. Couldn't get a clear answer about the phone they were recommending about the specs of the phone which they say the Samsung S 20 Ultra is similar to what I have. That isn't what I'm looking for... it must have the Gorilla glass. Was suggested I could pay for the added protection in case my screen should get shattered... I understand the concept, but build a better phone and you have to protection built in like with the Galaxy S7 active. Having insurance doesn't help if my phone screen gets shattered in the middle of the night and I can not use my phone. Build a better phone.",1
Had an better overall experience with t-mobile.,1
They help me sometimes. Sometimes not very nice. Good prices though.,1
"I don't hate AT&T and I also don't love them.... I've had them for about 10 years ever since my ex-husband wanted an iPhone for Christmas and this was when they had the exclusive so we switched carriers and plans to get them.  I've been with them ever since.I travel a lot - and often out of the country - so I usually use one of their plans where I can use my phone so I have data, text and can make calls at a discounted rate.  It's expensive to purchase one of their pre-set plans for about $60 or $150.  The last time I did this I was saddled with a $220 phone call from a Kyoto (Japan) hotel to another where I thought I had left a favorite pair of pants (which I hadn't and were actually not even packed in my bag and were safe at home, bummer).I called - and they fed me some BS about how even if I had paid for the plan I couldn't use wifi and showed me where it was on like page 47 of their plan I signed up for.  It was super confusing and didn't make sense.  Instead of arguing I asked what we could do now after the fact since I had obviously tried to avoid that by paying in advance for the travel plan.  They backdated some plan for me and modified the call to about $30.  Still more than I thought I should pay but it was better than the $220.This happens a lot when I travel but the bottom line is, calling in and asking them or paying the $10 overseas fee to use it daily is probably best.  Or perhaps a SIM card.Otherwise I don't have major issues with AT&T.  They're pretty good as far as my regular plan goes and I've made minimal changes in the past 10 years.  It works for me.",1
Decent experience if you don't call their support team.,1
outrageous prices but... can't beat the service,1
"Just an averaged company, nothing special.",1
"When AT&T advertises a ""Buy One-Get One"" deal - buyer beware! NOTHING is free with AT&T!My BOGO deal was a ""free"" iPhone 7 when purchasing (signing a contract for) an iPhone 7+. After the purchase, I noticed a recurring credit of $21 on my bill. I thought it was because of certain discounts I get for membership in an organization AT&T honors, so I didn't pay much attention to the credit.Later, when I was able to pay off all my mobile devices, I noticed my bill had increased over $300! After arguing with the customer service rep, I was informed that AT&T had expected me to continue the installment payment plan for the iPhone 7+ for 30 months. But because I paid the balance for the installment plan after only 17 months, I was now liable for the remaining balance for the ""BOGO"" iPhone 7. I was INCREDULOUS!When I objected, the lady told me that I was informed this would happen at the time I paid off the balance. However I was never informed and told the customer service rep that if they wanted the $300 for the ""free"" phone they should take it out of the other rep's paycheck because he failed to inform me of the consequences of paying off the balance of the installment plan.Of course, she said they couldn't do that. So I demanded that AT&T should absorb the $300 because it's a misunderstanding and, after all, I've been a loyal customer for 25 years and it would be good customer relations. I said if AT&T would do this, I would make my satisfaction known publicly through Social Media. However, if AT&T failed to handle this in my favor, I said I would take that experience public on Social Media as well.The customer service rep paused for a moment, put me on hold, and voila! When she reconnected with me she said they had worked out a deal for me. If I ""technically"" put the iPhone 7 BACK on an ""installment plan,"" they could continue the monthly $21 credit until the balance of the installment plan was paid, with nothing coming out of my pocket! I agreed to this compromise, and AT&T has held up their end of the bargain. So, AT&T is now paying for their own ""free"" BOGO phone again.This issue was, indeed, resolved to my satisfaction, and ALL of the 3 service reps I spoke with were courteous, friendly, and competent.But remember, AT&T + BOGO = Buyer Beware!! Nothing is ""free"" with AT&T.",1
"Service in the UK is OK. But roaming abroad is a nightmare. Bought a data upgrade plan for use while travelling in the US but never worked once while I was there. Followed all the instructions for setting up your phone properly, including going through all the id mobile help forums and adjusting esoteric settings. But other users report exactly same problem with roaming outside the EU. Will be going back to a big provider at end of contract.",1
My number didn't seem to transfer over properly even though I used the switching service. The new number was displayed when I sent text messages instead of my old one. I didn't get missed call notification when people tried to ring me. I had problems for the first month which hopefully have  now been sorted out. It would have been really good to have been able to take my phone to someone to help me instead of things been done online.,1
The billing is not easy to understand My plan is supposedly £8 month but typically higher as I do use add ins but they are not explained,1
"What I like: buying from ID was easy and effortless, good communication too. Everything looks good, but! Probably it's the Three network, but rather often I have no internet access even when the phone shows 4G and 3 bars out of 4. It just doesn't work... Annoying, far worse than EE what I had before.",1
"The operator, while polite and friendly my issue was not resolved to my satisfaction. My subsequent billing was not very well explained and promises made by the sales team were not kept.",1
"The monthly contract fee is decent, unfortunately the internet connection/coverage is very poor. With the previous provider I had 5G very often, but here I haven't encountered it yet.",1
"Generally Ok but they will change your monthly costs in the middle of your contract.. what seemed like a good offer initially is merely Okay.What goods a contract if they can just change it at will?Everyone's living costs have increased, how about I renegotiate with you a little less? Is that fair too?Additionally they will continue to charge you full price for your handset even after it's paid off (24months)",1
I'm generally happy with ID service but there is one annoying issue which is very frustriting. Basically being recently in Central London and Manchester my mobile internet just did not work at all despite having full 5G signal recepton. I am guessing this is because of the fact my ID sim's bandwidth is reduced to near zero in very congested areas. I want to highlight this is purely network issue as my wife and daughter (also on ID network) experience was exactly the same. This is an area you need to improve big time.,1
Very poor internet. Although you get 5G sign on the phone but internet speed is rubbish on so many areas in London,1
"ID as a company I have nothing but praise for, cheap, great app, great online backup.I've been with them for years.Sadly though it's the now pretty appalling ""3"" network they run their services on. And it is so awful now I've had to leave ID.I live in a decent sized town and there's is now zero signal pretty much everywhere within it, and I can't get any signal in my house at all. It's got slowly worse and worse over the last couple of years. Yet despite repeated complaints, ID can't seem to get 3 to do anything, and 3 dont even bother respond when approached directly.So it's a thumbs up to ID, but do check 3's dubious network before you commit!",1
"Sometimes,signal is suddenly out of order, even the phone call, and it happened so many times. I have to restart again and wait for few minutes.",1
"I disliked the fact that iD list 50 countries that are covered in their roaming packages, only to find out after getting on board, that Italy is not one of the countries covered…… Potentially, I will now have to pay more on top of my monthly tariff ! Also, I notice that there appears to be no facility to add funds to use premium numbers, like “61054” which is a Greatest Hits Radio Premium SMS number. Any chance either of the above will change soon ?",1
Great service in terms of delivery. Good app and prompt delivery of new handset plus returns envelope for old handset. Unfortunately I’m still yet to receive the payment for my old handset. 2 emails but no reply!,1
Price of plans are very good however signal coverage lacks in a lot of areas especially for data even checking the coverage before ordering,1
"Never got 5g connectivity in the same device which I was using, while I was with three UK. Even 4g speed is not that great. Thinking of changing ID soon. Even in central London internet speed is too slow, than think outside London area. Also no call centre where you can get any help, everything online or a chat bot. Using ID SIM from last 45 days and not so impressed.",1
Very hard to get a costumer addvicer at them end of my contract I will change to a different net work,1
"Generally happy with the cost and reliability while I am out and about, but unfortunately I am unable to get a signal while I am at home. I did check before switching to you to ensure I should be able to get a signal at home but there is clearly a problem. My post code is HR9 5UF",1
I am unable to access my accout updates on my phone,1
"Great price but patchy network.I know they use Three’s network, so it’s not specifically their fault, but I regularly go through black spots and places where you only get 3G coverage - which is prettt useless these days.Thought it was a result of living in north Nottinghamshire, but had the same issues on the M1 near Daventry today.Good access along the country’s main motorways should be a given.",1
The service were I live is rubbish even though on the checker it said it was okI use the wifi calling when at home as the phone signal is rubbishEven in London it's a bit hit and missI made a mistake moving to this I'd and I'm stuck with it for the next 23 months,1
"I feel the price of contracts are reasonable but I tried to open 3 contracts for me , my wife and my child and they wouldn't let me due to some crazy policy and I was only aloud to open 2 which was one of the points I was swapping providers",1
Signal is patchy in some built up areas. Other networks have better signal in south Banbury,1
"Decent enough network, but not outstanding.Technical issue from 2022 still hasn't been resolved two years later: namely, can't receive SMS while roaming from non-UK numbers. Works on Three but not on iD Mobile.Cancelling your contract is laborious and talking to robots and chat agents to achieve, which is ridiculous in 2024.",1
Whilst the phone package I currently use is competitive - my ability to connect to family etc over the last 3-4 weeks has been disgraceful. At time I have been able to contact people inc husband who was sitting next to me …I believe ID use the 3 network..Will be looking for a new supplier after Xmas…,1
I am disappointed with the network signal coverage it  is very poor in alot of areas  with signal coming and going regularConstantly  1-2 bars 3 on a good day never seen the  full signal filled.,1
Affordable plansTrouble to signing in my iD Mobile accountResolved now!,1
Good service I just wish that the signal was better noticed it's quite low in most areas that I live.,1
"I’m with ID mobile for more than year, and happy enough. Signal is very average even in city centre of Belfast and text message sometimes last long until is received, long mean a day which happened yesterday and that is obviously not great.",1
"I am elderly and would like to have a customer service that I can speak to….to guide me through where I want to go.  I suppose a chat bit might do ,but not very user friendly.",1
Great deal with phone and sim but very bad reception. Can use phone indoors very often with data switched on have to use WiFi. And very often calls don't go through.,1
I live in a poor reception area and have considered finding better cover. There is nothing more annoying than when your call drops out.Your Web site shows that you cover my area. Sadly only poorly.,1
The lack of being able to contact someone at ID Mobile from the website is not good. There is information available on the website but it's a pain having to find it especially if the subject is not covered by any of the FAQ's and most of the stuff written by the 'ID' community does not interest me. It would be so much easier if you could email someone even with a short character limited message,1
At home I have WIFI so no problem but when I am in my caravan in the Malverns the 4g signal is not connecting to my phone my partner on her phone no problem she is with Tesco.,1
sometimes the signal could be better but overall ID offer good value for money and service.  some sort of app feature to identify and feedback poor signal areas would help identify areas for network improvement's to address the poor signal / no signal areas and also improve the coverage map to more closely show actual performance rather than predicted coverage.,1
Was trying to switch both of my EE expired contracts to id but there was issues activating simThen when deleted e sim had issues getting replacement as one was sent for wring nr and other not sent at all so had to pick up from currys .Overall contacted them on many occasions customer service very robotic and not good .Going to another provider now as first impression wasnt good as well as the signal.,1
I dislike the fact a new customer can get a better deal than existing customers  there was an I phone se 3rd generation for £19.99 a month which i took out and couldn’t keep my number if I got upgraded it was £22.99 for same phone with less data,1
I can never get an assistant at my local Currys when I go in. Your staff in the past have been very helpful but it's really hard to get a member of staff now.  As a pensioner I am not technically on the ball so find it very frustrating.,1
"Changed to ID as existing supplier was increasing cost for less , kept same number and the change over was faultless. Joined ID as received email saying 5 g available in my area and coverage map showed it was , problem is its not , on 1 bar on 4 G and download speed of 1. 5 MBS at most , the roll over data is pointless as not fast enough service to use the monthly allowance never mind roll over . It however seems that miss information regarding service availability is not grounds to cancel contact so stuck in a 12 months con which is all but useless . Customer se work from a script so totally un pre to deal with most cases. As seems to be the norm , any company that has communication as its core also seems to have Communication missing from its customer service.",1
"Huge shout out to the manager at Shallotte NC store Quieta, she went an extra mile just to make sure I left the store 100% satisfied, she deserves to be praised besides a raised on her income, people like her makes this hectic world go round. Quieta was knowledgeable, courteous, professional and a blessing. Please make sure you hire more people like her, for now I am a very very satisfied customer and I thank you and I will make sure my friends and family know this.",2
"I am a new AT&T customer. Your install team--Joe and Lee--were here at my home for about 4 hours on 1.10.25. They were both extremely pleasant, patient, helpful and conscientious. They took great care in choosing the best location for our new AT&T Internet equipment and were fastidious in keeping our home just as they found it. They were the most courteous of ""workmen"" we could have in and out of our house for several hours. We honestly enjoyed speaking with them and finding them both personable and thoughtful. We recommend them very highly and they gave us the absolute best first impression of our new relationship with AT&T!Also, I want to comment on Blaine, an ""account"" man who came while Joe and Lee were here. He was also a most pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable employee of whom you may be proud! He explained many things about our service and even gave suggestions I found very positive and enlightening.",2
"Greg went above and beyond to fix my problem, showd patience and friendly. Am so glad I have switched to AT&T.",2
I recently purchased the iPhone 15 at the AT&T store in Warren RI Sage the manager there was outstanding and very knowledgeable ! I could not have had a better experience! Joe who also was very helpful helped me pick out a good protective case for my new phone! Both gentlemen were fantastic!!,2
"This rating came because of 1 Customer Service Representative at the 33rd & Broadway, Portland, ORI updated to an IPhone 14I’ve been a long term customer and brought my family and friends to AT&TI was overcharged and found changes to my account I never asked for or agreed toFor 3 months I paid almost $400 per month(twice the price of my original billing) I ended up with 4 lines and an additional phone number I never heard oand was charged an additional $70 for that phone number and lineThe was told my business wasn’t important to them and should take an offer from another companyThen u met Sean Osborn, Service Rep who solved all my issues for real this time, valued my business, took the time to resolve the problems and get me my refundsHe made me believe again in good service and came as a customerThank you AT&T for Sean, he should be compensated and promotedEmployees like Sean are the greatest value and I’m grateful he helped me",2
"Matthew at the West End Ave. location in Nashville, TN went ""above and beyond"" to assist me during a recent visit to the store. After I relayed to him that I suffer from short term memory loss due to a recent illness, he patiently helped me to program my new cell phone and guided me through how to use it. Matthew exemplified what it means to be both tech savvy and customer friendly. I am grateful to ATT for making the transition to my new phone a positive and uncomplicated experience.",2
My iphone broke on Christmas Eve and I had to call AT&T customer support to transfer my number to my old phone Christmas morning. Simon was very helpful and patient! I am so happy to have had him assist me and I hope he gets the best Christmas bonus this year!,2
I had a scheduled appointment with AT&T to repair my land-line. It took a few days and they were unable to get to it on my scheduled day. But I really appreciated they came out the next morning which was Saturday and fixed it. Many thanks to the technician.,2
"We had an amazing experience with Kevin at AT&T! He was incredibly helpful in finding us a great deal, and the best part was his approach—he wasn't pushy or trying to oversell us. Instead, he made us feel like we were getting advice from a friend who genuinely wanted to help. Kevin's friendly and professional demeanor made the entire process smooth and stress-free. Highly recommend him for anyone looking to have a positive and enjoyable experience at AT&T!",2
I want to give a huge shout out to an amazing employee for Att&tJuan at the Plymouth mass store in Home Depot plaza !

I just wanted to write a review about going to AT&T in Charlotte North Carolina on South Tryon. I receive such good service. I’m close to 70 and they spend time to explain everything to me. There was a manager named Stetson that I was very pleased with how he explained everything so I would give him a five a great review.,2
"Avery is an outstanding representative for AT&T at Best Buy in Altamonte Springs. Normally, I do not stop for sales pitches, but Avery's approach caught my attention. He actively listened to my concerns, never made me feel pressured, and allowed me to take my time with the decision. He was also incredibly courteous to other customers, assuring them he would assist them as well.This was my first experience with AT&T, and I hope the service lives up to the high standard Avery set. I took advantage of the iPhone 15 family plan deal and couldn't be happier. When I had a follow-up question after Thanksgiving, Avery responded the same day with the same level of professionalism and care.Avery doesn’t just talk the talk—he truly walks the walk. Exceptional customer service like his deserves recognition. AT&T, give this man a raise!",2
This is Dre Idk whoever Mo AT&T text she is great made me feel like I was texting one of my friends VERY HELPFUL  SHE DESERVES A PROMOTION ASAP,2
"I am glad I am a customer at AT&T. Every time there is a hurricane for example they always jump into action making sure that I am okay, offering help, making sure I can always stay in communication with loved ones etc. It’s really thoughtful and shows how much they value their customers. Thank you AT&T :) for always going above and beyond.",2
Whenever you call AT&T to hold your cellular service . They will hurry up and disconnect you . Never handle what you need for them to take care of . If you are paying your Bill or buying a new product they are quick to dismissed you .I went on a cruise and AT&T has that international fee for $12 . I cut off my WiFi my Bluetooth my cellular service . Yet they still charge d me . Everyday I took a picture to show them that it was cut off . These bastards going to say I used my phone . Then show me to where I made one phone or sent one text . The next thing they ended our conversation. I’m at the point to where I think I’m going to have to get rid of them,2
"I don’t remember the exact date but about 2 weeks ago we went into the local Columbus, Georgia AT&T store on Macon Road needing account assistance.

"We have just visited AT&T store located at @9725 Skokie Blvd, Skokie and were served by Gerardo. He was courteous, knowledgeable about almost everything we asked him and explained all our queries in lay person’s language courteously and with humor. His demeanor was brilliant compelling us to write immediately after getting out of the store. Truly appreciated his advice and help. Wish all your staff would be same calibre.",2
"I would like to thank Barry from AT&T for his excellent service to repair a cut fiber cable at my home in Maumelle, Arkansas. The original fiber contractors that came out were going to reroute the new cable across my front lawn and under my driveway. This would have done a lot of damage to my yard and possibly messed up my irrigation lines. I contacted AT&T service, and they sent out an inspector who did everything he could to route the new fiber cable through its original path so there was no need dig up my yard. Barry was terrific. Barry certainly deserves all the credit and made my day by resolving this issue. I am now a big fan of AT&T and highly recommend them.",2
"Never take AT&T . This is a bullshit company. Great scam I have ever seen. I did trade-in and later on paid of the device to unlock the device. Technically I paid 2 times , later on they take out my trading credit form bill coz i paid of the device. And they do scam when i purchase the line they did not explain me that it has 36 month contract, They said you can move anytime. That was another trap for me. It's been 1 year's i am still overpaying everybills. If i leave i have to pay a lot for each phone. Never chose this company. Your life will be in hell like me.😞. Also agent said their system has some billing problem, If your system has problem why we will pay more money for that?? My request everyone please never take AT&T.",2

"I had  recently added  AT&T phone service  to my long standing internet  service. I got  my  Galaxys24 FE in th email, its a much better  and more advanced phone than Im use to. I was disheartened when I called several stores in my area (Tulsa) to be told they couldnt help me with file transfers or anything tech support related. I finally made the call to customer service, and the tech that got on the phone was corteous and  knowledgable, he took the time to understand my issue, and had the patience to calmy walk me through every detail and help me understand each process so I would be a more informed  customer of my devices. He even went above and beyond to help me fix  the home wi-fi crisis that plagued me for over 2 years. Id like to personally thank AT&T  for  keeping such fine customer service  reps  and techs employed. Though it took time, mostly due to me, I did take the extra time to speak to his supervisor and ensure they knew I was impressed and thankful for all that my tech did. I believe in giving praise  for excellence in customer care. Thank you",2
"I had a great experience on my most recent visits to AT&T in Tallahassee, Florida.

I’ve had AT&T for 5 years now and my bundle discounts were never applied for having their internet and phone services. They were not willing to give me a discount by a manager. I was told it’s ONLY FOR NEW CUSTOMER!!!!! So they don’t care if they lose a loyal customer. Thank you to Trinity for her great customer service and for understanding. She was able to apply some discount for being a loyal customer. She didn’t want to lose a loyal customer. Thank you again Trinity.,2
"Went to AT&T in Merrillville on US30 with a cell phone issue and the service I received was more than fabulous and the employees Ms. Raven, Ms. Shonna and Mr. Terrell went beyond the call of duty to make sure I was completely satisfied and all my electronics was in working condition.

We just had the first positive experience going into an AT&T store. Garrett Johnson was the most knowledgeable competent serviceman. He needs to be training other employees.

"Wonderful company - I have had AT&T Prepaid for a couple weeks, going on month and the company has been great! The service is reliable, and the customer care team has been nothing short of amazing. I remember when I was activating my phone and I was short by a couple dollars, the rep who was awesome did a credit, helped me and had my service up and running with no issues. The plans are great, the website works like a charm. However, I do wish a mobile app was offered for the prepaid side, but that's okay. I will give this company a solid 10/10. I have never encountered issues with signal, customer care, or being dramatically congested and slowed down. Truly unlimited for $65.00 is a deal. That's for sure! I highly recommend AT&T Prepaid.",2
"On 15FEB23 at 4PM , my wife and I visited the AT&T store on Whittesey Blvd. in Columbus, Ga. to explore options for unlimited cellular data from AT&T. After a short wait, we were greeted by DJ, the Retail Sales Consultant. DJ immediately understood the purpose of our visit and quickly went over the various options for cellular data to include monthly costs and the application of my veterans discount. DJ was very professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. He exhibited genuine concern that our cellular needs were met and that we were fully satisfied with the plan we received. AT&T is fortunate to have DJ as a front line customer service representative.Thank you,John Baggett",2

I have liked AT&Ts service. The real reason for the review though is to thank Jen in customer support. She solved a problem for me efficiently and it was an issue no other AT&T service rep was able to figure out. She located my trade in phone which was somehow not processed initially. She put my mind at ease.  She was great!,2
"We use AT&T for internet and wireless services. So far we have been happy with the fees and service overall. At times the internet can be slower, but they have so many various levels you can choose which internet level you need. I need the highest since I stream, trade options and do a lot of internet shopping.My cellphone service is good too. Overall no dropped calls or lag time when I am out of the house. I can surf and watch videos when we are on vacay!WOULD RECOMMEND",2
"I was trying to get on-line to make calls but since late yesterday, was unable to make any calls.  I could received them from the message site--Anyway, we went to AT&T in Gulfport, Crossroads Pkwy and was assisted by Mr. Keith Edwards, the Store Manager.  He listened to my problem, asked to see the phone and in less than a minute had everything back the way it was supposed to be.I asked him to show me his magic and it was a case of  simple ""turn off/turn on"".  He was friendly, helpful, kind----If all trips to ATT were done that way, ATT would be swamped dailyandMr. Edwards would own the company---with knowledge and kindness.",2
"A company is only as good as its employees.After being tossed around by one of its competitors, I decided to switch to AT&T and purchased two Samsung 2023 Ultras. One was stolen from my shopping cart. After several visits to an AT&T store, the personnel were very helpful but unable or unwilling to get me across the finish line. As a last resort, I decided to try another store and was taken immediately by Evan Montoya, a rare find for any company. He was extremely patient, self-confident, and super knowledgeable. And most of all, he was able to resolve my problem. He is Management material.After the replacement S2023 Ultra arrived, we returned to the store only to be told that Evan had been transferred to a new location. Although we will seek Evans's assistance with the new phone, I am confident that the young woman who told us Evan was transferred would do a competent job transferring the information and apps to the new phone. Unfortunately, I did not get her name.I would give a 5 STAR rating to two of the three AT&Tstores I visited.",2
Only good things to say about them!I have great phone service and they provide great customer service. I've been a loyal customer for years/decades and have no intention to switch.,2

"Susan at the Salmon Creek, Vancouver, WA. store was absolutely amazing. I am a RN and because of Susan I am signed up for FirstNet which is a wonderful service for healthcare providers. My bill is also lower. She took the time to make sure all of my needs were met and all my questions answered. AT&T is fortunate to have her on staff.",2
I am literally on the phone as I write this review with AT&T. We are all so quick to write a bad review. I want to be just as quick to write a good review as I would a bad one. Customer Service with AT&T TODAY was the best I've recieved ever. As far as customer service goes. I had more than one issue and Alexis for business customer services with AT&T was remarkable! She took care of every issue I had mentioned within a 10-15 min time frame. Not only was it fast service but also super relieving concidering I work as well. So every minute can be way to time consuming but Alexis made every minute worthwhile. I am able to get right back to work with everything I requested; With enough time to write this long review as well. Thanks again Alexis your customer service is absoluty refreshing.,2
"I visited the Rome store on Turner McCall Blvd.  Lesley Osborne greeted me and helped me purchase my new 14 Pro phone.  She was friendly and patient with me.  I explained that I am an older user who did not grow up with cell phones, in fact our one phone per family was connected to the wall.  We had a great laugh and connection, and I could tell that she would be happy to help me if I needed to return. She also showed me options for an Apple Watch which I plan to purchase from her in the near future.  There was not a 14 Pro in stock, but she ordered it for me and it should arrive within 5-7 business days.  She reminded me to bring it back upon arrival and she would put the screen protector on and make sure my contacts are transferred!  THANKS!!",2

"Warm and sincere complement for sales associate JESSE KELLY at Galleria at Tyler F124 Riverside CAHe was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and forthcoming with his expertise, knowledge about products, but most importantly his kind demeanor.  I had specific questions about my iPhone 8 which he answered honestly and comprehensively. I also had concerns with 'no service' areas of my home and he addressed those issues too.He evinced excellent customer service, and I really appreciated his professional knowledge and pleasant, welcoming openness. I felt treated with respect and appreciation.He's the kind of sales associate that keeps customers coming back.",2
My home internet have problem and need services. The customer services and technician(install a new modem) was so great and professional to fix it. Thank you.,2
Christian was the best. Very knowledgeable and helpful about different product and services available. Gave us a screaming deal on IPhone 13 for $390. Can’t beat that on Apple Store. Will use again to you phrase to IPhone 15 soon.,2
Will at Grand Ave ATT in Billings MT provided good customer service.,2
"Originally, I posted a review here about trouble I faced when upgrading my iPhone through AT&T. I encountered a frustrating issue since AT&T asked me to upload an ID to confirm my identity, but after the fact I realized they actually wanted my father’s ID (the account holder) as opposed to my own, which was not clear. Thereafter, every order I attempted to place on AT&T’s website was canceled apparently for security concerns.The promotion advertised to me for upgrading my phone was online only, which meant I could not simply place my order via phone or go to an AT&T store to skirt the issue.After making my issue known, AT&T proactively contacted me and followed up daily until the problem was completely resolved. This was unexpected from such a large company, and incredibly helpful at a time when I felt like I exhausted all avenues for upgrading my phone. I would like to thank AT&T and particularly Gary V. for their outstanding customer service and for fully resolving my issue.",2
